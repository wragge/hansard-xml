<PARA>I do so because, although most honourable senators would claim that their particular petition on any day may be distinctive from the general run-of-the mill of petitions, in this case I would like to point out that this petition derives from Scottsdale, a town of some approximately 4,000 inhabitants. In a few days, some 1,321 of its residents readily signed a petition on behalf of a very fundamental component of their community. In doing so, they did not seek political attention, but rather just attention to the specific nature of the Materials Research Laboratory which is located there. I will not delay the Senate any further except to say that I think this matter needs to have attention drawn to it.</PARA>

<PARA>This Bill seeks to repeal part of the Australian design rule No. 19.01 which deals with electrical connections on motor cycles. </PARA>
<PARA>The aim of the Australian design rule which has come into effect as of 1 March 1992 is to force all new motor cycles that are sold from 1 March onwards to have the headlight wired in such a way that when the engine is started the headlight will automatically come on. </PARA>
<PARA>We are dealing specifically with clause 19.6.106.9 of the Australian Design Rule No. 19.01 of the Motor Vehicle Standards Bill 1992 which we are moving to have repealed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government seems to have neglected to consult with the users regarding this new regulation. In my experience no one single motor cyclist has been pleased to have this design rule forced upon them. </PARA>
<PARA>There has been much research into the pros and cons of having lights wired on. The key point is that when you look for the research evidence, both in Australia and overseas, you find that what is lacking is conclusive evidence that this measure actually adds to road safety. What this means is that the government hastily made this decision without properly researching the issue and has gone ahead without properly consulting those most directly affected. </PARA>
<PARA>The decision as to whether to turn on the motor cycle light during the day should be up to the rider. A responsibility, as with other vehicles, that is up to the driver. The majority of cyclists do turn their lights on for part of their day riding but surely experienced riders, who are quite adamant that having the light on can add to the risk, should be allowed to make their own decisions regarding safety. </PARA>
<PARA>Apart from the freedom of choice aspect there is the question of legal liability. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not clear whether or not this Bill will add to the liability of the motorcyclist who could be involved in a accident with a motor car. The difficulty lies in proving whether or not the light was actually on. The globe may have been smashed in the accident, it may have blown two minutes before the impact, or the day before. Along with the legal liability question there are the ramifications for insurance. </PARA>
<PARA>This new design rule could also add a false sense of security. People could believe that by having the light wired on it will somehow make them safer. This, in many cases, could be the exact opposite. Questions arise concerning the ability of some motorists to judge the speed and distance apart of an oncoming vehicle with its headlight on, thus adding to the danger, not to the safety on the roads. </PARA>
<PARA>But where this design rule is at its most ridiculous is with agbikes having to have their light wired on. </PARA>
<PARA>While I support most vehemently every effort to increase road safety, I believe that this issue of motor cyclists being forced to have their light on is a misguided move by the Minister, further highlighting that this government is out of touch with the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">MUTUAL ASSISTANCE IN BUSINESS REGULATION BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent times we have seen the rapid internationalisation of financial markets. In practice, geographic and political boundaries are becoming more and more irrelevant to the way in which the world goes about its business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This trend towards internationalisation has led in turn to world markets becoming increasingly interdependent. Trends in one national market have immediate effects on other markets throughout the world. No better example of this interdependence can be found, Mr President, than in the stockmarket crash of 1987 which spread almost simultaneously through the world's established and emerging securities markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This process of internationalisation creates administrative, jurisdictional, detection and enforcement difficulties not only for the international aspects of trading but also for the regulation of domestic markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This in turn increases the scope for the pursuit of undesirable market practices across national boundaries and the penetration of domestic markets by undesirable operators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Integral to the maintenance of investor confidence in, and the efficiency of, national financial markets must be the development of effective international co-operation between the national business regulatory agencies responsible for administering and monitoring those markets. This co-operation involves the capacity to seek from, and provide to, such agencies in other countries flexible, speedy and effective assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This need for increased co-operation and assistance has been recognised in a number of international forums. The International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) has called upon its member organisations to provide reciprocal assistance in obtaining information in respect of market oversight and prevention of fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the Commonwealth Law Ministers meeting in Auckland in 1990, Ministers identified the need for mutual assistance in the area of business regulation. That meeting noted that voluntary co-operation between agencies needed to be reinforced by legislative provisions to enable powers of compulsion to be exercised in the fulfilment of requests in appropriate cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, Mr President, the OECD, in its review of the impact of internationalisation on financial markets, noted the need to achieve world wide regulatory coverage of international conglomerates. The OECD recommended the development of arrangements for exchanges of information between national regulators which supervise different parts of financial conglomerates as one way of ensuring appropriate regulation of these bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In answer to these international calls for closer cooperation, Mr President, this Bill sets up the framework for Australian agencies, such as the Australian Securities Commission and the Trade Practices Commission, to provide assistance to their overseas counterparts. As a result of the legislation, these agencies will be better placed to seek assistance in their own investigations from their foreign counterparts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short, Mr President, the proposed legislation would enable prescribed Australian agencies, with the Attorney-General's consent, to compel the provision of information documents and sworn testimony in aid of requests from foreign agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheme established by this Bill will complement the obtaining and exchange of information between countries for the purposes of criminal prosecutions which is established by the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the proposed scheme for mutual assistance between business regulators applications by the foreign agency will be made to the Australian agency in the first instance which will make an initial assessment of the application and either reject or pass it on to the Attorney-General. In making this initial decision the prescribed agency will take into account amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the resource cost to the Australian agency;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the availability of the same information to the foreign agency from other sources;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the likelihood of the Australian agency successfully obtaining the information sought in the application;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the extent to which the foreign agency has corresponding functions and responds to or is likely to respond to a similar request from an Australian agency, including the existence of any memorandum of understanding between the applicant and the prescribed agency relating to mutual assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Australian agency does not reject the application the Attorney-General may decide whether to authorise the collection of the information sought by taking the following matters into account:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">national interest considerations;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">international law and comity including whether the overseas agency has a corresponding facility to provide mutual assistance;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">whether the information sought is likely to be used for the purpose of punishing a person for an offence of a political nature or punishing or prejudicing a person on account of a person's race, sex, religion, nationality or political characteristics;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">whether the information is sought for the purposes of the administration or enforcement of business regulatory laws as opposed to an investigation of indictable criminal offences such as organised crime (in which case recourse should ordinarily be had to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where the Attorney-General has authorised the Australian agency to act on a request the agency will be able to require a person to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provide specified information, evidence or documents relating to the subject of a request contained in the application;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">attend before the agency or a member of the agency to provide information on oath or affirmation;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">otherwise assist the Australian agency in responding to the request contained in the application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Bill will also contain extensive safeguards to ensure that persons who are required to provide assistance are appropriately protected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, hearings will be held in private, with attendance being limited to persons whose presence is requested by the witness or whose presence is authorised by the Commonwealth agency taking the information and representatives of the foreign regulator. Witnesses will be able to be represented by lawyer or by any other person with relevant expertise such as an accountant or an expert of the law of the requesting agency's country. Witnesses will be eligible to be paid travelling and other expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While self-incrimination will not be a reasonable excuse for failing to answer a request by the Commonwealth agency, self-incriminatory evidence or information (as opposed to documents) will not be able to be used for criminal proceedings against that person. In addition, foreign agencies which request assistance in obtaining information or evidence will be required to provide undertakings that any such evidence provided by a person that incriminates that person, will not be used by that agency in criminal proceedings against that person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the level of protection against self-incrimination which is provided by this Bill corresponds with the level of protection which will be available to persons required to provide assistance to the Australian Securities Commission in its domestic investigations as a result of the amendments contained in the Corporations Legislation (Evidence) Amendment Bill 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, Mr President, the Bill preserves to an appropriate degree legal professional privilege.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to these safeguards, the provisions of the Privacy Act will continue to apply to Commonwealth agencies when gathering information under this legislation. Persons required to provide assistance will have the benefit of the comprehensive protection in that Act relating to the collection and use of personal information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, during 1991 Parliament passed three important Corporations Law measures. A fourth reform Bill has been exposed for public comment earlier this month. This Bill complements those corporate law reforms by ensuring that Australian agencies play an integral role in international business regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION AMEND MENT BILL (No. 2) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 will amend several Acts within the Attorney-General's portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill contains amendments of a minor policy nature or which correct existing legislation. None of the amendments concern major new policy proposals or sensitive policy issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only the proposed amendments to the Judges' Pensions Act will have any financial impact. The amendments to that Act are expected to have a minor revenue impact, as pensions which would have ceased to be payable will now be payable. It is expected that the number of additional pensions will be small.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments are explained in the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill contains amendments to the Judges' Pensions Act to provide that surviving spouse pensions will continue to be payable after remarriage. Provision is also made for the reinstatement in certain circumstances of a widow or widower's pension which has ceased to be payable under current law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment to the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Act 1955 will simplify the process of approving leave of absence for members of the Defence Force Discipline Appeal Tribunal by providing that the Minister, rather than the Governor-General, may approve leave.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also makes a number of minor amendments to the Family Law Act. It will amend the definition of `order under this Act' in section 112AA. The amendment will make clear that the sanctions available to the Family Court for dealing with breaches of its orders will be available when a person fails to comply with a subpoena.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will repeal sections 116A and 116B of the Family Law Act which provide for payments to States and Territories for financial assistance in family law matters. These sections were made redundant by new legal aid funding arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also amend section 123 of the Family Law Act to update the maximum penalty that may be set for breaches of Family Court Rules. The Rules impose penalties for failure to comply with a summons, for failure to comply with a garnishee order and for making false or misleading statements to the Court. Substantial penalties are required to deter breaches of the Rules.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we adjourned this matter last night I was in the process of explaining that the arguments which were put in favour of this legislation, namely, that there was a shortage of logs and that this was due to the locking up of forests in national parks and in heritage areas, were demonstrably false. I was reading a quotation from the Resource Assessment Commission, and I will begin that quotation again. The Resource Assessment Commission said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important consequence of the prolonged period of overcutting is an impending shortage in the supply of hardwood sawlogs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>quite clearly identifying the overcutting as the source of the problems. The quotation continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This coincides with, and is caused by, the cutting out of most of the unreserved old growth well before significant numbers of regrowth saw logs reach harvestable size. This anticipated outcome is probably the main reason that milling quotas have been reduced progressively in all states. This reduction, rather than the inclusion of timber producing areas in national parks, is the main cause of the dwindling supply of hardwood sawlogs.</PARA>
<PARA>The Resource Assessment Commission also rebutted the ridiculous claim, which we heard repeated last night, that access to forest was being impeded by the Australian Heritage Commission. It concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The listing of a place on the Register of the National Estate imposes very few legal restrictions on activities that may be conducted on that place. National Estate listing, for example, does not equate with the declaration of conservation reserve status, nor does it preclude logging in forests.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not an earth shattering finding, as anyone who has read the Australian Heritage Commission Act and followed its operation will know. Nevertheless, the truth has not been allowed to get in the way of a good story, and I am sure later on today we will hear that good story, false as it is, repeated endlessly&mdash;particularly by the Opposition. We are now debating a Bill which explicitly excludes the Heritage Commission from a continuing role in monitoring projects which have been granted so-called resource security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Association of Forest Industries backed up its complaints with a breathtaking claim that $4.8 billion of investment in timber and paper processing projects depended on the passage of this resource security legislation. According to Michelle Grattan, writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 8 March last year, Senator Button&mdash;not in any way averse to embroidering the truth&mdash;claimed that as much as $20 billion of investment in resource processing projects might go ahead. It is hard to believe that Senator Button exceeded the industry's hyperbole by more than 400 per cent, but it seems that he did. In the same article, Senator Richardson was quoted as saying the debate was really about one Tasmanian pulp mill. It has become quite obvious that Senator Richardson was much closer to the truth, but even he has been proved to be optimistic. North Broken Hill has told the Government that passage of this Bill would not guarantee&mdash;and I repeat that, would not guarantee&mdash;that it would proceed with a pulp mill in northern Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its draft report, the Resource Assessment Commission noted that neither the Association nor any other industry representative had guaranteed that projects would proceed if legislation were enacted, and that representatives of companies involved in the industry had stated that current capital costs and market conditions would prevent immediate investment. In other words, there is no urgency about this legislation at all. The same conclusion was drawn in a memo in October last year by the Deputy Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Sandy Hollway, to Mr Hawke and other Ministers, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The attitude expressed in original responses of industry indicates that investment will not be forthcoming&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In that case, proceeding further would involve much pain for no gain.</PARA>
<PARA>Contrary to the long and loud howls of the forest industries, the facts of the matter are that, firstly, national parks and reserves are not responsible for the loss of timber resource available for logging; secondly, the Australian Heritage Commission has not posed any significant obstacle to the timber industry; and thirdly, resource security will not produce an investment bonanza. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the pillars on which this Bill rests are mirages. It should never have reached this chamber; it should have remained nothing more than a fantasy in the minds of those who want to wish away the environmental and economic realities of Australia in the 1990s. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the provisions of this Bill are anathema to ecologically sustainable development, to sensible economic policy, and to sound environmental management. The first stated objective of the Bill is to `identify, and facilitate the protection and conservation of, forest areas of significant environmental, cultural or heritage value'. This is supposedly to be achieved by a comprehensive integrated assessment process that involves consideration of the environmental, cultural, heritage, social and economic impact of the project. In other words, it is already predicated on the idea that there will be some intrusion into those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one reads the fine print, all that is required is that the Minister `must be satisfied' that an appropriate assessment has been completed. This is a loophole big enough for several large logging trucks to drive right through. If all the Ministers have to do is show that they are satisfied, they have the discretion to simply accredit previous studies as meeting the assessment criteria, whether or not those studies are adequate. If their decision is challenged in the courts, they do not have to show that the assessment was thorough, but merely that they were satisfied that it was appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not merely an academic point because the Tasmanian Government fully expects that the 1.1 million hectares of so-called multiple use forest which it has designated for logging will not be&mdash;and I stress `will not be'&mdash;subject to further assessment. This was made absolutely clear by the members of the Forests and Forest Industry Council of Tasmania at a recent Democrat seminar on resource security held in Hobart, despite the fact that at least some of those 1.1 million hectares had not been assessed at all&mdash;again I stress `had not been assessed'; for example, a large area adjoining the Mount Field National Park. A further 10 per cent of forest was included in the logging zone, against the recommendation of the Parks, Wildlife and Heritage Department that it be nominated for World Heritage listing. The Tasmanian Aboriginal Land Council told our seminar that it had not been&mdash;again I stress `had not been'&mdash;consulted on resource security by the Federal and State governments. That surely underlines the weakness of that first criterion in the Act, which relates to the surety with which forest areas would be identified to facilitate the protection and conservation of those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmania's attitude guarantees that a Commonwealth-State assessment process would be either a whitewash or a brawl. Given that the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow is alleged to be a world-scale pulp mill, the odds would be heavily in favour of a chlorine bleached whitewash. The irony of this legislation is that a real commitment to up front, integrated and thorough project assessments would negate any need for resource security legislation under which the Commonwealth gives up its environmental powers. This is because a genuine assessment would greatly reduce the chance of environmental surprises springing out of the woodwork and preventing access to certain forest areas once the project is under way. I draw a strong contrast between this legislation and my private member's Bill on threatened species which would see such a comprehensive up-front assessment of areas with management plans put in place before&mdash;I stress again `before'&mdash;projects would be proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major reason for the uncertainty which industry complains about is the lack of a comprehensive assessment process. If a thorough survey of the value of a forest area is not conducted before logging is approved, it is inevitable that surprises will result. Far from being the product of environmental laws which are too stringent, uncertainty in resource allocation is a result of laws which are too weak. We simply do not know enough about this nation's ecosystems. The surveys now being conducted are grossly underfunded and will take literally centuries to finish&mdash;by which time, as with the painting of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, we will have to start all over again because the Australian environment will have been totally transformed by the greenhouse effect and continuing human plunder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context the Democrats have given their qualified support to the recent agreement between the Heritage Commission and the Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management, which was based on a survey of the southern forest region for National Estate values. It is a step&mdash;but only a step&mdash;in the right direction which makes resource security legislation redundant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the recent seminar in Hobart conducted by the Australian Democrats we put this view to members of the Forests and Forest Industry Council of Tasmania, who agreed that our view was logical but that logic would not solve the problem to which resource security had become the only answer. The Democrats reject the view that illogical legislation should be passed simply to appease a section of industry. The main reason why this Bill would be an environmental and economic disaster is that it would entrench the logging of native forests and lock out better alternatives for decades to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems of the forest industries have not been caused by environmental laws or the environment movement, or even by the overwhelming majority of Australians who oppose native forest logging. They have been caused most of all by economic factors. But the industry has chosen to identify a scapegoat rather than to tackle the real problems. The industry just wants to fight an enemy it thinks it can beat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that native forest logging is a dying industry. As the forest economist Judy Clark has documented in detail, it is dying because native forest hardwoods are increasingly being displaced in the sawn timber market by plantation softwoods from Australia, New Zealand and Chile. It is dying because the export woodchip market will soon be dominated by supplies from huge plantations of Australian eucalypts in such countries as Brazil, Chile, Portugal, Spain and South Africa. It is dying because of the woeful incompetence of State forestry commissions who subsidised an uneconomic interest at huge expense to the public purse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Resource Assessment Commission's figures show&mdash;and I think the Senate needs to have these figures drummed into its collective head&mdash;that between 1927 and 1989 the forestry commissions ran up deficits of $4.4 billion, in absolute terms, not adjusted for inflation. To take their relative value, if those debts which were run up in earlier years were adjusted, it would make that figure much higher. These same forestry commissions would have an even greater role in forest management if this Bill were to pass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No amount of legislation will revive the prospects for native forest logging. What is needed is enough Government wit and vision to move the Australian industry into plantations for its own sake. What is also needed is for the Government to recognise that to encourage investment in large export oriented pulp mills based on chlorine bleaching is to place bets on the survival of dinosaurs. Ecologically sustainable development demands that we move to industrial processes that minimise effluent and resource consumption. The depressed state of the international pulp and paper markets suggests that the most sensible strategy is import replacement based on non-wood fibre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the pulp and paper industry, the rational conclusion is to encourage the further development of medium scale pulp and paper plants employing relatively benign chemical processes and using recycled paper, plantation timbers to the extent that one has to phase them out, and non-wood fibre sources as feed stock. Judy Clark has documented numerous investment proposals that meet these criteria, yet the Government and the Opposition have failed to get behind these alternative industries as the best way to eliminate our pulp and paper trade deficit through the 1990s. I recently spoke to canegrowers in northern Queensland who would dearly love to build a kenaf based paper industry from the ground up, provided they could get some government assistance for development purposes. It is these opportunities that the Government should be looking at. It is these opportunities on which the Government has turned its back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth asking why the Government decided to proceed with a Bill which is so fundamentally misconceived. Several answers suggest themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, at the time that the decision was made, the Hawke Government had been under attack from a militant and macho industry which was waging a high profile scare campaign, backed up with truck blockades of this very building, in its attempt to water down its environmental obligations. The Government lost its nerve and simply appeased the industry and the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, the Government felt pressured to send a signal to the business community at large that it could make decisions which&mdash;although only window-dressing&mdash;would be seen as pro-investment and against the wishes of the environment movement. So Mr Hawke publicly reneged on a pre-election commitment to leaders of the Australian Conservation Foundation that he would not proceed with resource security legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Third, there was a belief within the Labor Party, which has since been exposed as hopelessly optimistic, that the survival of the Field Government depended on Commonwealth resource security legislation being passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourth, this Government and its bureaucracies have failed to comprehend the constraints imposed by the real world&mdash;ecological constraints as well as economic constraints. For all the lip service being paid to ecologically sustainable development, it is a new label on an old bottle as far as this Government and this Opposition are concerned. Rather than heading in an economic direction which offers some hope of future economic viability, the Government is maintaining its charge towards the cliff. This is lemming legislation, a blueprint for economic and ecological suicide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is well known that, as Treasurer, Mr Keating was vehemently opposed to this Bill. As Prime Minister, he has given it no support but has instead endorsed the cooperative regional assessment model as an alternative. But rather than withdraw the Bill he has been content to let the Opposition and the Democrats defeat it. That, we would agree with the Opposition, is incredibly cynical. His reasoning appears to be that, had he taken the initiative to scrap the Bill, he would have reopened divisions within Caucus and brought the wrath of industry down on his head. By handing the hatchet to the other parties he has directed the wrath of industry onto the heads of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition, despite its total lack of understanding of ecologically sustainable development, had&mdash;at least until recently&mdash;managed to grasp that this legislation is an appalling millstone around the neck of any government. It removes the discretion to exercise judgment in major project approvals by making it compulsory for a government to grant resource security once the conditions have been met. In media statements and in the speech made in the House by the Deputy Leader of the National Party in the second reading debate, the Opposition has advocated project by project resource security instead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Opposition is also engaged in a damage redirection exercise. It does not want to upset the business community and has done a back flip by endorsing amendments drawn up by the National Association of Forest Industries, despite the fact that these amendments do not provide for case by case approvals. If the Opposition is seriously committed to these amendments, it has, in effect, abandoned its opposition to the Bill and will be exposed for its abject inability to hold a principled line in the face of interest group pressure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is more likely that the Opposition is conducting a publicity stunt aimed at painting the Government as anti-business and blaming it for the demise of this Bill. The Opposition is banking on Caucus preventing the Government from accepting any significant amendments, thus ensuring that the Bill will not pass and the Opposition will not be saddled with it if it wins government at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No matter what the outcome of this debate, it is blindingly clear that this is a Bill that no party in this chamber really wants. It is the product of woolly thinking and loss of nerve, yet the Australian Democrats are the only party which has had the guts to state its opposition publicly and consistently and stick to its position. The farcical and cynical game being played by the other parties does them no credit. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having betrayed the resources industry on which Australia's economic survival depends, through the `prevent mining at all costs' decision regarding Coronation Hill, this Labor Government now presents a belated sop to the same industries. It was very disturbing to hear Senator Coulter's contribution a little while ago when he said that for the sake of the environment, and the economy, this Bill must meet its early demise. It is absolutely unbelievable to think that the Democrats can stand in here and honestly profess that they care about the economy or jobs or exports or Australia's income. That matters not to the Australian Democrats. If it did matter to them, they would be trying to make sure that this piece of legislation actually had some substance to it. It is a severely flawed piece of legislation and we have said that to the industry all the way along the line. Of course, the industry has now come out in support of the position that we are taking in trying to make this very seriously flawed piece of legislation somewhat better by amending it at the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Coulter is in any doubt whatsoever, maybe he should have checked his fax machine before he came in here this morning. If he had checked it he would have found out that all the major industry groups are very much in favour of tidying up this legislation. He pays no attention to what the Forestry Protection Society, the Forest Industries Association, the Australian Forest Growers, the New South Wales Forest Products Association Ltd or Slater Contracting Co.

And yet Senator Coulter interjects and says, `Yes, of course, they would be interested because it means money and everything else'. Of course they are interested because the situation will provide jobs. It will provide export income and it will provide income for the rest of Australia. But that is not what the Australian Democrats want. Quite frankly, we are now putting the Government to the test to make sure that that is what it wants as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation needs amendment. It is for that reason that we will be putting up the 17 amendments in the committee stage and it is also for that reason that we have sought to send it off to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. That is the committee that will be able to assess the evidence provided by the witnesses who will be affected by this. It will also be able to assess the evidence that has been provided by the States and by the Premiers. All of this is particularly important if we are to turn this country around. Sadly, of course, the Democrats do not want to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no security in this Labor Government as it continues to follow the example of Senator Richardson, who made it his business to buy green preferences at the expense of blue-collar jobs. If the electoral equation means short term vote gains for this Government, well and good. Of course, the Democrats are in exactly the same position. They have lost ground, they have no ground, they stand for nothing, other than for a few little trees that might be able to regenerate. They do not worry about the industry at all. They do not worry about the jobs that that industry will generate. We are talking about trying to make some legislation responsible legislation. To this end, the unamended Bill is deliberately framed to give the minimum anxiety to the extreme green lobby which, in spite of its public opposition to anything that appears to assist forest resource industries, can rest easy in the knowledge that this Bill will still enable a Labor government to intervene at any stage of a project. That is not what is desirable. It is not what is needed by the industry and it is not what is needed by Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, when introducing the Bill last year the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) acknowledged that there may be circumstances where the Government would wish to `take a second look at the way a project with legislated resource security is being conducted'. What does that mean, other than that the Government can and probably will interfere? It is not much use for the Minister to say that such circumstances would be `remote' and `unexpected', as he did. In recent years, through Coronation Hill and through the Tasmanian deal with the Greens, Labor has taught both business and resources employees that it cannot be trusted. That is a simple fact of life. We have seen these deals being done regularly for short term gain in votes, and we know where the Democrats stand in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But nor does it mean much to acknowledge and disclaim the `industry's feeling of uncertainty, engendered by fear of the Commonwealth using its powers to remove significant tracts of forest from productive investments'. That is also a quote from Mr Griffiths. This does not make sense. These fears can only remain and increase when constructive advice from the industry is ignored, and action can be taken under this Bill against approved projects because of `major physical impact' on the environment, an endangered species, or a significant Aboriginal area if such circumstances are `not foreseen'. Who are they trying to bluff? There is enough information, there is enough research, there are enough agencies and so forth prepared to investigate these things long before they are approved. Why, then, should the Labor Party have an override in all cases?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In cold, hard terms we can expect all the Green lobbies to produce all of these unforeseen circumstances once they are determined to stop a project. We are dealing with a profound anti-growth ideology that must on occasion be confronted and denied if we are to have an economic future. It is for that reason that the Australian Democrats must also be confronted and denied on a lot of issues for which they stand. If they were really serious about a lot of these things, they would be supporting our action in trying to amend this legislation. If it is not going to be amended then that is clearly a different story, but to bury their heads in the sand&mdash;as they do regularly on other issues, and particularly on this one&mdash;is nothing short of a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Commonwealth does intervene, what does this Bill say about compensation for the resource security that will have been revoked, or about an alternative resource? Without amendment it offers absolutely nothing, and the Democrats are quite happy to go along with that. Clause 23 of the Bill states directly that no compensation is payable when the Commonwealth makes a decision in regard to a project that has resource security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also has the major defect of being confined to projects worth $100m, thus providing no recognition or protection for Australia's 1,200 sawmills. It is not particularly convincing for the Minister to refer to Government approval of `a non-legislative form of resource security' for the bulk of the forest industries. The people at the sharp end of these industries know that without legislative backing there is absolutely no security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the Government and the Democrats, the Opposition has sought to meet the concerns of the industry and its employees. We are, therefore, moving the 17 amendments to which I referred earlier, and referring this Bill to the Committee to be able to investigate it fully&mdash;and, of course, in order to produce legislation that will provide some basic security to the forest industry. We consider that particularly significant, and we certainly hope that by the end of the Committee's inquiry the Government, and even maybe the Democrats, will. I do not hold out much hope, I might add, for the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `no compensation' provision of clause 23 must be removed, and with it a major concern of the industry. A new clause 22A will require the Minister to consider what steps can be taken to give an enterprise access to alternative resources. It is not specific, but it ensures that the principle is recognised, giving investors a very positive signal. It is about time some investors in Australia had some positive signals provided to them by government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remainder of our amendments, of course, are directed to including within this Bill accredited State forest industry development plans. Clause 11A couples this with an assurance of modernisation of facilities within the area, an increase in the value of production from the area and the maintenance of plantations&mdash;all are very significant amendments. These are sensible, moderate amendments that have the support of the key players in our national industry, led by the National Association of Forest Industries which stated yesterday that `the amendments will make the legislation genuinely workable'. They will provide a basis for investment and long term employment. Why is it that both the Government and the Australian Democrats will not look at the industry position and what it thinks is workable within reasonable bounds?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I would acknowledge the support of the Forest Industries Federation of Western Australia whose input has been of great, constructive assistance right from the word go. Again, only yesterday that body requested the Premier of Western Australia to intervene in support of these amendments. It is a great shame, of course, that the Labor Government of my State has not shown the same dedication to the forest industry that has been displayed by the Tasmanian Government&mdash;the new Tasmanian Government, I might say. It should have been in there battling for our forestry workers a lot earlier in regard to this inadequate Bill so that such a request would be unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, members have seen fit to sit on their hands, and not to worry about growth and development in Western Australia. As time goes by, we have more and more examples of Premier Lawrence just doing nothing to make sure that Western Australians can have more jobs, more investment, and more export dollars coming into the State. It is about time, particularly in the light of WA Inc. and all the squandering that has gone on in that State, that they started to produce some export dollars and provide some jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Labor Government, and of course the Democrats, try to ignore the fact that the lack of sustainable development of forest industries in Australia means that our trade deficit increases by $1.5 billion on timber products. We are importing 63 per cent of writing paper, 44 per cent of newsprint, and 48 per cent of softwood sawn timber requirements. It is a situation that can only deteriorate unless our forest industries know when and where they can get on with the job. But do the Democrats worry about our having a balance of payments problem? Do they worry about jobs? Do they worry about bringing money into the country by sending our products out? No, they could not care less!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only a matter of preserving jobs in the timber industry, or creating new jobs in such areas of high unemployment as Tasmania. It is a national task of fostering export and import replacement industries, and this dimension has been absent from Government actions thus far. The proposed amendments are moved in order to ensure that State forest industry development plans have particular relevance to the future of the industry in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The joint report by the Australian Heritage Commission and the Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management was released last month. In general terms, it provides a balance between the needs of conservation and those of the timber industry over 2.5 million hectares of public land. I believe it was unfortunate there was no direct input from the timber industry when the process was commenced in September 1990. As a Western Australian, I would frankly consider that the Department of Conservation and Land Management needed no outside input in establishing sensible rules and procedures with the industry, as were laid down in a 10-year regional management plan of December 1987 that gave resource security while proposing 95,000 hectares of new parks and reserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do regret that the Australian Heritage Commission did not accede to the advice of CALM that listings in the register be confined to the 660,000 hectares of national park, conservation park and nature reserves established by 1987.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may have been well and truly stated that the listing of private land on the Register of the National Estate does not impose legal constraint on the landowner as to the usage and disposal of property, but merely upon the Commonwealth. However, it is not so much the actions of the AHC but those of both the Hawke and Keating Labor governments that make the community profoundly mistrustful of the implications of any such listings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact that a potential purchaser of farming land in Manjimup would, all things being equal, prefer to buy land that was not on the Register. The effect of listings on land value should not therefore be ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality of the situation is that it is not enough for the AHC to restate that listing involves no legal disability on the landowner. The question is being asked of what future legal constraints may be imposed once property is on a register. It would be wise for the Government and the Democrats to remember that people are not fools when they ask, `Why list land areas if nothing is going to be done?'. That is a very, very good question and it is one that is in the minds of many, many people as the process goes on and on. The responsibility comes back to this Labor Government to provide an unequivocal, legislative assurance that listings of private land in the Register of the National Estate will never involve legislative constraint on private property. If this assurance for the future cannot be given, the AHC should not list private land. So why will the Government not give that assurance? One can only wonder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill purports to give security to major forest resource projects. The Liberal and National parties cannot support it without the essential amendments we are proposing in support of the National Association of Forest Industries, because it gives no such security.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without genuine resource security, Australia will be inexorably transformed into a very much poorer country&mdash;as if we can afford that today!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Labor Government, as much as dark green extremists, will bear a major responsibility, having put forward legislation that was wilfully ineffective. In effect, the move of the Opposition to amend the Bill gives the Government breathing space to wake up to its responsibilities to the industry and to Australia. We should all remember the golden rule so tragically displayed in other parts of the world that poor countries degrade their own environments. It is about time the Government and the Democrats started to take heed of that fact. I certainly hope that this legislation is amended in the form that we are proposing when it gets to the Committee next week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the Forest Conservation and Development Bill, which seems to be otherwise known as the resource security Bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will keep intact forever this Government's great anti-development record. There has not been one major industry established in Australia since this Government came into office, and this will ensure that that remains the case. What a record of destruction, of forestry and mining in particular but of industry in general!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, with the discussion that is going on, if we wish it I have a very easy way out. I could destroy whatever credibility I have and vote for this rubbish, if I wished to. I could be a one-day hero and hoodwink the Tasmanian electors into believing that it would help them if I did. I could lie to those electors and tell them that the Bill is okay. I could at the same time sell out all the small sawmillers in the country towns throughout Australia, the whole 1,200 of them, and any prospect there is of any other development in any of the milling areas of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say now that I will not. I am prepared to stand by that. It causes me no concern at all to do what I know is right, namely, to challenge the bona fides of this Government and call on it to accept the NAFI amendments and get the pulp mill project back on the track. That is what we are on about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments that we are talking about, briefly summarised, would be as follows: to extend the eligibility for resource security to areas involving an investment of under $100m; where resource security is lost because of unforeseen circumstances, to provide access to alternative resources; and to remove the provision of clause 23 of the Bill, in which it is stated that no compensation is payable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what we are talking about. There is no great socialist philosophical jargon involved in this&mdash;none at all. If the Government's bona fides are such that it wishes to proceed with this legislation, that is what it takes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subject has raised considerable interest, particularly in my State, where the pulp project is the reason for the Bill in the first place. The people of Tasmania are absolutely desperate. After nearly a decade of this Government at a national level destroying the future of Australia and after 2 1/2 years of the most diabolical government combination ever in Tasmania, the situation there is absolutely desperate, and the people of Tasmania reflect that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators might imagine, I am having a lot of calls, a lot of phoning, a lot of writing, a lot of visits from people who say, `Why can you not get this settled? We want legislation to enable the pulp mill to be built'. I say, `I am in exactly the same position. I want legislation that will get the pulp mill built and at the same time preserve the position of the sawmillers and those in the other rural areas of Australia where milling is of importance'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of misinformation that is being peddled about the country is enormous. We have to bring people back to the truth. The implications of what is going on are not understood. I have not yet found one person who has come to me with a reason for wanting us to support the legislation as it stands who has ever seen or read the Bill. Only by reading the Bill can people see what is wrong with it. It has built up all sorts of hopes on no foundation at all. It is mean, paltry and pathetic for the Government to produce such rotten legislation under the guise of doing something that it is clear it will not do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the Australian Democrats oppose the Bill. They make no secret of that. Whatever reasons they may cook up do not matter because we know they are opposed to it, and at least they come out and say so. The Government has yet to demonstrate its bona fides for even wanting resource security legislation. As far as the coalition is concerned, we totally support security of resource. It should not be necessary to have legislation to provide one of the absolute, basic fundamentals, but we do need legislation because of the antics of the Government. One has only to look back at the Evans spy flights and the Richardson fiasco over the Wesley Vale mill to realise that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every developer is entitled to be given real security. The investors and developers of Australia should be able to insist on its being workable. They should know that their investment is going to be satisfactory. They should not have to wonder whether, if they invest their money, they might lose it all. They should not have to require legislation just to provide security for employment and investment. The coalition supports the NAFI amendments because those amendments would provide that security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed that the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) even said that there was overwhelming support for the legislation. I do not know where he got his overwhelming support from because it just has not worked out that way. To say that he has overwhelming support is one of the grossest pieces of misstatement that one could imagine. Of all the people who have contacted me who have been aware of the facts, not one has said that he or she would support this legislation as it is proposed, except as a last resort. Two people have said that they would like the legislation passed as it is, as a last resort, if we cannot get it amended. </PARA>

Against that, I have a little file here of people who have written to the contrary or made suggestions. I will go back as far as 16 October 1991, to a letter which was in response to the letter of 4 October from the then Prime Minister. This project was first produced on 4 October. On 16 October NAFI, the national association representing all the sawmillers and forest users in Australia, made seven points to the then Prime Minister. They read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Although the Bill is entitled the Forest Conservation and Development Bill it would in fact at best provide for conservation and development of only a section of Australia's native forests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. In its current form it does not deliver security for the existing industry. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. The legislation is selective and discriminatory in that it only provides for $100m plus projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. The approval process appears to be largely open ended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. The exceptions in the legislation are so all-embracing that our legal advice is that the legislation would deliver only an illusion of security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. There is a lack of symmetry and complementarity between the Commonwealth and State approaches to forest policy. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. The draft legislation would lead to a level of involvement by the Commonwealth in industry operations far in excess of that required to ensure ecologically sustainable forest use.</PARA>
<PARA>On 17 October, in response to the same letter, the Pulp and Paper Manufacturers Federation of Australia&mdash;representing APM, APPM, ANM and all these other major companies&mdash;in brief, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we find a number of areas of major disagreement with the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. It does not provide security of wood resource for existing operations. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. It does not cover new projects of less than $100 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. The proposed legislation has a number of open-ended clauses which relate to unforeseen environmental impact and to the matter of compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. There appears to be an excessive and unnecessary set of regulations as part of the procedures to monitor the forest operations. . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For these reasons, the Federation cannot support the proposed Bill in its current form . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Queensland Timber Board on 21 October said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Resource Security legislation, which is underpinned by a $100 million threshold, can have no relevance to the Queensland industry.</PARA>
<PARA>In a media release on 18 December NAFI again complained about the non-compensation clauses and the regional exclusions. In a letter to the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, of 21 January, it also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we cannot give our full support because it does not give coverage for most of our members.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, the NAFI attitude toward the current legislation can be summed up as follows: The Association could not provide full national support for the existing legislation but would not oppose its passage if it could provide the basis for a northern Tasmanian pulpmill. If, however, provision was made for the eligibility criteria to include scope to cover State or regional forest assessments, provided they were carried out to Commonwealth standards, and the compensation issue was dealt with satisfactorily, a great deal of public support would be forthcoming from the industry together with a lot more investment and protection of jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>On 23 January Timber Investments Management Private Ltd in a letter said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have decided not to show any expression of interest at this time as we are not confident that the Australian government will continue to permit the cutting of natural hardwood forests in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA>On 13 February the President of NAFI said to the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the Government's decision in March last year to support resource security for projects over $100m it has become increasingly clear that the bulk of the industry will only be able to achieve its investment goals if the eligibility criteria under the legislation is expanded to encompass regional forest management plans such as those passed by the Parliament of Tasmania, and more recently agreed between the Federal Government and the government of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We therefore urge you to include a commitment to broadening the eligibility of the resource security legislation in your February economic statement to include a regional approach.</PARA>
<PARA>And so it goes on again. On 18 February NAFI, in a press release, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Twenty-four of Australia's leading forest industry business and union leaders have written to Prime Minister Paul Keating urging the inclusion of regionally-based resource security legislation in the February 26 Economic Statement.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, these included every one of the major paper companies, every one of the major timber companies and many of the leading union people in Australia&mdash;and the ACTU. On 19 February, NAFI put out a press statement which said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1. The current legislation is not supported by NAFI in its current form as it will exclude most of the industry. . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">2. NAFI's policy is for Commonwealth legislation based on a regional approach and the alternative of a non-legislative intergovernmental agreement is not supported; and in addition the `no compensation' clause should be removed from the bill.</PARA>
<PARA>Where are all these letters of support? I have not seen them. If people wanted me to support this legislation, I am sure that I would have letters from them. Where are they? What is Mr Griffiths doing to hold these people who would want to support his legislation? I can go on: in a press release dated 29 February, NAFI says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill should be amended to incorporate the following principles:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the `no compensation' clause should be removed from the current legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $100 million threshold will remain for major projects.</PARA>
<PARA>On 13 February a letter was written from NAFI to the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . jointly urge you to include a commitment for regional resource security. . . the bulk of the industry will only be able to achieve its investment goals if the eligibility criteria under the legislation is expanded to encompass regional forest management plans such as those passed by the parliament of Tasmania. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Here we go again&mdash;it is supported by all those union people, all those industry people. On 28 February, Pacific Dunlop, not a minor player in this, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is a great deal of scepticism that the enhanced intergovernmental agreements to which you have referred many times will provide the necessary security. . . would urge you to recognise the crucial importance to the hardwood sawmilling industry of the amendments sought by NAFI.</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Paper Manufacturers, on 28 February, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would urge you to consider appropriate amendments as suggested by NAFI.</PARA>
<PARA>The Victorian Forest Industries Association, on 2 March, in a letter to Mr Griffiths, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . strongly support a regional approach to the legislation. . . I find it distressing that it has not been possible, so far, to negotiate what seem to be fairly straight forward amendments that would satisfy all industry sectors and gain unanimous industry support.</PARA>
<PARA>And that is a fact. This goes for me too: I will give this my absolutely total support and the coalition will give it total support&mdash;on the approval of this minor amendment. It is not a major issue. There is nothing in the philosophy of the Labor Party that says that this cannot be done. There is nothing in the new publication, whatever its name is, that says that we cannot do this. It is not contrary to Labor policy in any way. It completely fits in with the statement of the Minister back in March last year. Why has it suddenly become a major obstacle, if the Government's bona fides are not in question? On 5 March, NAFI wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Continuing claims by Government Ministers that the National Association of Forest Industries supports the Forest Conservation and Development Bill in its current form were denied today by NAFI Executive Director, Dr Robert Bain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Bain described media comments attributed to the Minister for Resources as a `mischievous' attempt to gain political mileage out of a situation where thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in new investments were at stake.</PARA>
<PARA>On 1 March 1992 NAFI put out a press statement which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NAFI, the ACTU and timber unions and the Federal Opposition are agreed on the amendments that are required to make this legislation broadly workable.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Griffiths, on 5 March, put out a statement that said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the support for the legislation is overwhelming.</PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the ACTU wants it passed.</PARA>
<PARA>But the ACTU was one of the signatories I read out who want it amended. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the timber unions want it passed.</PARA>
<PARA>No&mdash;they too were on that list of people who want it amended. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the National Association of Forest Industries want it passed.</PARA>
<PARA>No, I am sorry, I have read out enough of its literature that, I feel sure, would lead the Senate to understand that it is not part of it either. But he does not go on to say where all this overwhelming support is coming from. I can tell him where it is not coming from&mdash;even though he has them listed. On 6 March, NAFI put out a statement which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NAFI, the ACTU and timber unions and the Federal Opposition are agreed on the amendments. . .</PARA>
<PARA>Again, it is still quite right. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They strongly reaffirmed the position that the current legislation cannot be supported.</PARA>
<PARA>On 5 March, Don McFarlane, the President of NAFI, referred to the critical need for this Bill to be amended and passed. He said that reasonable amendments to the Bill could make it workable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Premier Lawrence was put under pressure from the Western Australian Forest Industries Federation. The Federation's press release says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The letter to the Premier says that without the amendments, the legislation does not offer long term security or the confidence for industry to invest in projects throughout the south-west.</PARA>
<PARA>The Premier of Tasmania, as long ago as 24 March, said in a letter to the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I urge the Government to support them too&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the amendments he is talking about&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to ensure the industry gets the resource security it needs.</PARA>
<PARA>Where is this mountain of support that the Minister claims to have? On 24 March, the Forest Protection Society of New South Wales said the same. The Australian Forest Growers also say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's . . . tree plantation owners today joined calls for the Federal Government to adopt proposed amendments to its resource security legislation as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA>The Queensland Timber Board's Public Affairs Manager, Christine Bongers, said:</PARA>

<PARA>I am sorry that I could not produce something to give Mr Griffiths some heart that he had overwhelming support but I have not had one letter to that effect.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tasmanian people are desperate to get resource security. As the Minister at the table, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Richardson), knows only too well from his previous experience that this legislation could not provide it, would not provide it and I have very grave doubts that it was ever intended to provide it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Gordon below Franklin fiasco, Tasmania has declined. We are now playing with an industry, the second biggest industry in Australia, that encompasses 250,000 employees. The Government is playing games with them. There has been a 120 per cent increase in timber imports since 1983-84 and not one step has been taken by the Government that is going to improve that in any way. In fact, the Government is only taking steps that cloud the issue even more, that take away any sense of security and that would make employment and investment absolutely unthinkable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The media, of course, are no help. They are always trying to go for the quick bash and the beat-ups and the sensations. They are trying to build these conflicts into the situation. In fact, I was not terribly impressed yesterday morning when a reporter of some sort rang me up and threatened me that, if I did not make a statement to him live on the air then, he would take certain actions against me. I think that is about as far down as it gets. I really believe that, when it gets to that stage&mdash;whoever it is, whether in the Government or not&mdash;of putting a journalist of this nature up to that sort of story, the game is going too far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The APPM is the major participant at this juncture. It has said that its bottom line position is that it believes that we should pass the legislation. The APPM says that, of course, as a member of NAFI, it accepts what NAFI says, and, as a member of the Pulp and Paper Manufacturers Federation of Australia, it accepts what the Federation says. But APPM would like these amendments and it believes at present that it would naturally improve the legislation a lot if it had them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the closest that the Government can go to saying that it has support. It has very limited qualified support and we cannot overlook that. It is good for APPM that it has in the legislation the other qualifications that it wants before it does its final feasibility, before it goes out looking for a partner and before it starts arranging any of its finances. It is a long, long way from being a cut and dried operation. But, with the fiasco we have had in the past and the way that this Government and this Minister have treated Tasmania in the past, I am not expecting too much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that if Mr Griffiths is allowed to just settle down in the cold light of dawn and go through the issues that have been raised and the degree of non-support that he has accumulated, if he looks at his Labour Party policy and talks to his ACTU and union friends, he will find that there is nothing wrong with acceding to the request that is being made. It represents no change to his Party's philosophy, but to the 250,000 employees in the industry throughout Australia, it would make all the difference in the world and give them some security. This legislation will not give them security. If the Government is trying to pretend that it is giving security when it has no intention of doing it, this is the way to go about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every commentary says that the Bill is flawed. Everybody says the same thing. Not one has come out and said that it is not. How can the Government and the Minister ignore this evidence? How can the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Richardson, with his experience in these matters, ignore this? The Opposition will support the NAFI amendments. If the Government has any bona fides left in this whole matter, it will too. If it does, resource security will be provided. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991 came into being under the previous Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. We know the reputation of the combination of Mr Hawke and the Minister presently at the table, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Richardson). We are well aware that Senator Richardson was one of the prime movers in getting rid of him, but we are also well aware that both Mr Hawke and Senator Richardson&mdash;Senator Richardson, in particular&mdash;brought the green votes forward for Mr Hawke on the previous occasion that Tasmania wanted a paper mill. We understand that on that occasion what Senator Richardson did was to let down not only the Tasmanian industry, but also timber industries and development in this country for many years. What he did was say to the world at large, `Do not try development in this country because there will be no guarantee you will get it.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill, of course, continues in that vein. This Bill is supposed to give security, guarantee of a resource. In other words, a company that is prepared to spend over $100 million in setting up a paper mill or any development that requires a resource of this country, should be able to look to this Bill to give it a guarantee that if it spends all that money it will have a resource at the end of the day when it starts up its business. This Bill deliberately leaves so many loopholes that, come the next election, as happened last time through Senator Richardson, the green vote will be given to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell the Senate what it says. To begin with it concerns developments over $100m, so the 1,200 sawmillers across Australia do not get a thing out of this. They are expected to spend all their money on development in the hope that the resource will be available to them at the end. There is no guarantee at all; there is not even any pretence of a guarantee. So it does nothing for all those small sawmillers round Australia, nothing at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill supposedly gives the large companies, those spending more than $100m, some resource security. But let me explain just what it does do. It says, `Okay, we will give you this area, but we will only give you this area of forest for your resource if, even at the last minute, someone cannot find some sort of threatened species in that area. If they do, if someone can find some threatened species, no matter how small or insignificant, then at the last minute that reserve can be taken away from you and that resource will not be made available'. There is no guarantee, no suggestion, that a substitute resource would be made available. Indeed, a specific clause in the Bill says that no compensation will be available to a business that goes bust, even if it has spent all that money&mdash;over $100m&mdash;had the resource taken away from it, and been offered no other substitute resource. The Bill specifically provides that no compensation will be available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Archer said, why will the Government not amend the legislation to take out the no compensation clause? It does not have to guarantee compensation, but it could at least remove the no compensation clause. The sawmillers and the smaller industries could then make plans knowing that if they spend $80m or $90m at least they will have some resource for the future. That is one of the amendments that we want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why will the Government not agree to such an amendment? Senator Archer said that to do so would not be contrary to Labor philosophy. I believe it would be very contrary to Labor philosophy because Labor philosophy says very clearly, `We have to leave the loopholes open for the next election so that if we want the Green vote we can grab it and bring it in'. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what this Bill is all about. It is nothing to do with giving industry security or with creating more of the jobs that are so necessary. We have a million unemployed already in this country. There is nothing in this Bill that has anything to do with creating jobs. It is just an assurance of more votes for the Labor Party at the next election; if they need that Green vote they can call on it. That is all it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister a couple of weeks ago, we all know, made that famous <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> statement. But in that statement, he overrode the old legislation that Mr Hawke brought forward. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth, in cooperation with the States, commits itself to an accelerated and expanded program of joint regional assessments of national State forest values based on the Western Australian model.</PARA>
<PARA>That is fantastic; that is what we agree with; that is what we want. This was in the Prime Minister's statements just a couple of weeks ago. Okay. If that statement overrides this legislation, why on earth would the Government go ahead with the legislation? Why would it not say, `Okay; the new Prime Minister wants regional assessment, therefore this Bill is passe; it is no longer of any value.'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell the Senate why. In the House of Representatives, when my colleague Chris Miles, the honourable member for Braddon, was debating this Bill, he said that the only reason the Government keeps this legislation on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> is that it knows that back home in Tasmania APPM is urging the Government to pass it. APPM&mdash;one company&mdash;is urging it to pass it. For political reasons&mdash;because the Tasmanian senators might get a bit of a bashing over it&mdash;this Bill is kept on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. Let me quote from what he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is only one reason: the Government wants to try to leave us with what it thinks will be the odium of the next election&mdash;the northern pulp mill.</PARA>
<PARA>When he said that, Mr Duncan Kerr, the only Labor member in the House of Representatives from my State, replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have got it.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Miles said about Mr Kerr's comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He says that it is purely political. He wants the odium placed on us; that is what he thinks. But I can tell the honourable member and all other Australians who are listening that it will not stick.</PARA>
<PARA>What did Mr Kerr say?  He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no Australians listening. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The House was not on air. So it was because the House was not on air that Mr Kerr was prepared to acknowledge that the only reason this Bill is still on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> is for political purposes. It does nothing for the industry at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have already said, there is only one group, one industry, one business, in the whole of Tasmania or Australia that is supporting the passage of the Bill, but even it wants it amended. APPM says, `If at the end of the day you cannot get your amendments through, then pass this Bill, no matter how bad it is'. Senator Archer has spoken about all the industries that have contacted us over the past 48 hours saying, `For heaven's sake, don't pass it without the amendments; for heaven's sake, get the Government to amend it so that it is genuine legislation'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go through just a few of those companies; Senator Archer went through so many that I will touch on just a few. Kempsey Timbers urges the Commonwealth Parliament to support the industry and union amendment package regarding the timber resources security legislation being debated today. The National Association of Forest Industries and the unions have put forward the amendments I told the Senate about a minute ago, not just for big mills but for sawmills, too, with the no compensation clause cut out and additional resource available if the promised one is excluded. These are the amendments that all these people are asking the Government to support; we do support them. We have Kempsey Timbers, Australian Paper Manufacturers and the Victorian Association of Forest Industries telling us the same thing. We have the Pulp and Paper Manufacturers Federation of Australia and Ford Timbers saying likewise. A Ford media release states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ford Timbers has been operating now for almost 80 years and we have contributed a lot to the local economy. . . We want to see our future, and the future of our employees, protected by legislation which has been properly thought out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ford said the implementation of the proposed legislation in its current form would offer no long term security to the timber industry generally and had to be amended if industry security was to be guaranteed.</PARA>
<PARA>This is jobs we are talking about. The Government already has a million unemployed people, but it will not support these small timber sawmills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us understand that the timber industry is the second largest employer of people in Australia. It employs more than 100,000 people; one of my colleagues says it is a quarter of a million. This Government is just ignoring their pleas to retain jobs in their industry. Hardys urges us `to adopt the industry-union amendments to the Federal resource security legislation, which seeks to protect existing jobs and investment and encourage future investment in the sawmilling sector'. The Australian Logging Council says the same thing. It urges the passage of the NAFI and union amendments. CCSO&amp;M, the advertising agency, says that if the amendments developed by both industry and the unions are not included, it is a hopeless piece of legislation. Slater Contracting Company says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are a small logging business in the Eden area employing 14 people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the last few years we have let the business run down because of the insecurity of the timber industry.</PARA>
<PARA>And why? Because of the action last time of the Minister at the table, Senator Richardson, letting down the timber industry and investors all over Australia, just to get the Green votes the Government needed to survive. So this small logging and earthmoving company with only 14 employees is going to the wall because the Government will not give it security to plan its future. Timber Investments Management says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have decided not to show any expression of interest. . . as we are not confident that the Australian government will continue to permit the cutting of. . . hardwood forests in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, people are not investing. How many does the Minister want on the jobless queues? Is he not satisfied with a million? Does he want more? What is the reason for not doing it, apart from votes?  New South Wales Forest Industries says the same thing&mdash;that the united industry-CALM-AHC agreement will be strongly opposed if the industry amendments are not included in this resource security legislation. We then come to Australian Forest Growers, who say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Government is really serious about wood plantations, it must accept the amendments which have been presented by the industry.</PARA>
<PARA>I could spend the whole of my speech quoting from the various groups that are pleading with the Government to allow them to develop, to allow them to have security, to allow them to employ people and to re-employ those they had to sack. This Minister, Senator Richardson, who is responsible for the last effort, ignores the whole lot because he wants to leave that loophole open. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Come the next election, the Green vote will be able to be grabbed by the Government at the last minute. It does not matter about jobs. It does not matter that at the moment, because of that last election, we now have a million people unemployed. It does not matter that the leader he chose over Mr Hawke admitted that he deliberately caused the recession. He admitted that. He said it in his own words: `This is the recession we had to have'. He engineered it, and we had to get down as far as this before we could recover. He admitted that it was his responsibility that we now have one million unemployed. This is the leader that this Minister chose because he knows that, as he does himself, that Prime Minister will do and say anything at all to grab the votes that are necessary at the next election to keep the Labor Party in power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the worst hypocrisy to treat a million unemployed people as mere numbers. I wonder whether those opposite have ever gone to a home that has been split by unemployment, where because the young people cannot get jobs and Dad is worried about his job, the young really have no interest in getting up early in the morning. Young people have been doing that, but they have not got the jobs, so they tend to sleep in a bit. Dad, who is getting up and is worried about retaining his job, says to the mother, `Why aren't the kids out of bed looking for a job?', and a brawl ensues because of the terrible tragedy of one in three of our Australian youth being unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government will not guarantee security to these small sawmillers, who have from 14 employees upwards, to enable them to plan, expand and invest. They refuse to do it, even at the pleading of all these groups. We have NAFI writing to the Prime Minister and saying that as a result of the decision of a meeting of its Association, the legislation should be withheld pending further consultations. That is what we plan to do. We plan to hold it up; not to hold it up deliberately, but to take it to a committee so that all these people's views can be put. We have all the letters. We can put the views of all these people to the Government members&mdash;because Government members will also be on that committee&mdash;and explain to them exactly what they are doing to the Australian people. I think with their ideology of not caring about anything except getting back into power they tend to forget that people are at the other end of this one million unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Archer said, we have had these appeals by all the paper manufacturers, by all the sawmillers, by all the forestry industries, the timber workers and all the rest of them, pleading with the Government to correct the Bill and make it sensible legislation that will create a secure resource for them. In the past 24 hours NAFI has said that the Federal Opposition and the Tasmanian Government have confirmed their support for the package of amendments presented to the Government last Friday. Just last Friday NAFI&mdash;the National Association of Forest Industries&mdash;and the unions presented to the Government this list of amendments that they want that will make this resource secure for them. The Government has been playing games. It has said it will consider getting rid of the no compensation clause, but it has not come up with amendments right to this minute. It is still not deleting that section from the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even last Friday, NAFI and the unions pleaded with the Government for these amendments that we are supporting. The Government has not responded to those pleas. So we have decided to put forward the amendments that the industry and the unions want and that we want. If the Government knocks them back we will take the matter to a committee comprising honourable senators on both sides of this chamber&mdash;Labor members, Liberal members and National Party members&mdash;and we will let the industries themselves tell the Government members just what they think. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important that the Government members understand the feeling behind this legislation. The Forest Industries Federation of Western Australia is pleading with Premier Lawrence. She was asked to intervene.

I used the word `supposed'. This legislation is supposed to be about employment and jobs; it is supposed to be about looking after our trade deficit and doing something about the imbalance in our trade in the timber industry at the moment, with about only $1.4 billion worth of exports, yet we are importing something like $2.3 billion worth of timber products; and it is supposed to be about security of investment, but it is not really doing anything about any of those things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet it is the first opportunity for this Government to show it is fair dinkum about the rhetoric of the One Nation statement. Given the chequered history of forestry in Australia&mdash;particularly in New South Wales in recent years&mdash;it is obvious that, for investment decisions to be made with any confidence, those wishing to invest be assured of the security of that investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Government has once again failed to deliver. It has sat on this legislation for a long time with very little result. The Bill gives absolutely no assurances, no guarantees and no direction to the forest industries. There is nothing in this legislation that says, `Go ahead, create jobs and install plant and equipment, because we will not pull the pin on you'. The majority of the industry's employees are involved in small operations, and this legislation fails to recognise that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the small operators there is no security of tenure, no encouragement to create wealth and no encouragement to create jobs for people in the community. They have been forgotten. Yet it is those small operators who have been affected the most by the constant interference in their industry&mdash;particularly by this Labor Government as it waxes and wanes in its efforts to woo the green vote. A new Minister at the table now, the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Richardson, can take a lot of the credit for the problems associated with the timber industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that what the Government says is not always what it does. Even the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), who is responsible for this legislation, seems to have fallen well short of his own rhetoric. I will quote from a paper he issued in February 1991 on resource security. It read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather, resource security is a process to identify and protect the environmental and heritage values of our forests and importantly, to enhance employment through encouraging a thriving, secure forest products industry.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that resource security is all those things. He said the reason we needed legislation was that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a perception within industry, the trade union movement and the community that the Government has no clear process to handle forest disputes and guarantee that certain forests are available for value adding activity.</PARA>
<PARA>And he acknowledged that there was uncertainty in the industry. I will quote what his paper said about that. It read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there currently exists an unprecedented level of uncertainty in the industry to commit to value adding investments so necessary to address the crippling current account deficit attributed to this industry.</PARA>
<PARA>The paper went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For its part, however, industry has clearly indicated to the Government that Commonwealth legislation is essential to secure those forest areas required to underpin investment decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Put simply, without the resource security process culminating in Commonwealth and State legislation then the investments will not proceed and the benefits of those investments will not be conferred on the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA>The paper went on further about the benefits that would accrue from a legislative level of resource security. It read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By providing for resource security process to address industry, employment and conservation objectives, there would be confidence for the forest industry to invest in value adding investment and for forest growers to invest in new methods to improve forest health and productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The confidence and investment would also assist in accelerating the transition from primarily oldgrowth to primarily regrowth native forest resources.</PARA>
<PARA>He accepted the importance of the forest industries and highlighted the impact on our trade deficit. The paper read:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989-90, Australia's trade deficit in forest products accounted for around 10 percent of our total current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister realised what would happen if appropriate legislation was not put in place. We have got to remember that this industry is Australia's second largest manufacturing industry, employing around 250,000 Australians in the forest and forest products, printing and allied industries. In the paper the Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a legislative policy framework for resources security is not provided, Australian forest products companies will continue to invest offshore. For example, AMCOR, one of Australia's largest forest products companies now derives 30 percent of its turnover from recent offshore investments in the pulp and paper sector.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Senate: have we got a Government in power here in Australia at the moment that would rather export jobs than export value added product? This legislation means that that is going to happen. We are going to export our jobs rather than exporting a product which we have got here in the country at the moment, a renewable resource product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was February 1991 when that paper came out, and that was when the legislation was drawn up. In October last year it was put to the industry, which told the then Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Resources that the legislation would not do what it was supposed to do. I quote from a letter from NAFI to the then Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Although the Bill is entitled the Forest Conservation and Development Bill it would in fact at best provide for conservation and development of only a section of Australia's native forests.</PARA>
<PARA>I know I am repeating what some other speakers have quoted, but it is very, very pertinent that this be quoted. NAFI made the following points also:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.In its current form it does not deliver security for the existing industry, which has been very seriously affected by decisions made by your government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.The legislation is selective and discriminatory in that it only provides for $100m plus projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.The approval process appears to be largely open ended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.The exceptions in the legislation are so all embracing that our legal advice is that the legislation would deliver only an illusion of security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.There is a lack of symmetry and complementarity between the Commonwealth and State approaches to forest policy, land use and resource security legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.The draft legislation would lead to a level of involvement by the Commonwealth in industry operations far in excess of that required to ensure ecologically sustainable forest use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then we have had a change of Prime Minister. Again the industry approached the Government, through the new Prime Minister (Mr Keating), urging a commitment to regional resource security:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the Government's decision in March last year to support resource security for projects over $100m it has become increasingly clear that the bulk of the industry will only be able to achieve its investment goals if the eligibility criteria under the legislation is expanded . . . </PARA>
<PARA>NAFI went on to repeat its concerns about the $100m limit, which has big effects over all Australia. On 18 February it issued, at a national level, a press release again stressing regionally based resource security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to cite some investments waiting to proceed in New South Wales. This legislation does not even cover any project in New South Wales, because of the $100m cut-off criterion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government has been presented with a report, FORTEC, which states that there are $95m worth of investments ready to begin in northern New South Wales immediately. This investment stretches over a 10-year period and incorporates several different companies. The legislation, without the amendment which accepts the State accredited plan, will not provide any security to begin even one dollar of that investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales Government has moved towards providing security at that level with the introduction of the Timber Industry (Interim Protection) Bill. This Bill, of course, was supported by some 4,000 people who were standing in Macquarie Street, Sydney, begging for the legislation. The Federal Government must provide a means of complementing that security at the Commonwealth level. If it does not, it will fail in its responsibility to the Australian community by rejecting $5 billion worth of investment in Australia's second largest manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, New South Wales&mdash;the State that Senator Richardson represents, that he has done so much to damage with some of his legislation passed in this place&mdash;directly employs 8,000 people in the timber industry, and that is a conservative estimate. Using the multiplier of about 2.2, that puts it up to 20,000-odd people affected. Communities that are 100 per cent affected and dependent upon this industry are places such as Grafton, Dorrigo, Wauchope, Casino, Woodenbong, Urbenville, Walcha, Glen Innes, Gloucester, Nimmitabel, Bombala and Eden. There are other places in my home State of New South Wales that are affected if we do not have the right sort of legislation. These are places such as Lismore, in which maybe 30 to 70 per cent of people are dependent on the timber industry. Also there are Coffs Harbour, Narooma, Moruya, Port Macquarie, Cooma, Newcastle and Murwillumbah. I would be failing in my duty to the people of New South Wales, including the people who live in those towns, if I did not stress to this chamber and to the people in the Government why there is a necessity to have a change in this legislation, and urge them to listen to some of the amendments that have been moved. </PARA>

Those people are still waiting. They are still waiting for the Government to decide whether they will lose all their investment. They are not big boys; they are not big investors. But an investment in a truck worth $250,000 is a very big investment. Those truck owners all have wives; they all have children; they all have people who actually have to be fed and clothed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation was meant to be about job security. Of course, the Government said of its One Nation statement that that was what the statement was about: it was about jobs and job security. This is the first test it has had and it has failed. As I said earlier, what is going to happen is that we are going to end up exporting jobs out of Australia instead of products. This Government, this Keating Labor Government, has been crying to us about value adding&mdash;crying out about it. What is it doing here with this legislation? It is actually crucifying its value adding policies before they even have a chance to have a go. </PARA>

He actually wants to lock up the whole of Australia. I can tell him, I can tell anyone else in this chamber, and anyone else in Australia that you cannot protect the environment without a vibrant economy and you cannot protect the environment without an economy that can afford to protect it. If we look at the other countries around the world where the environmental damage really needs looking at, we will see that they are economies that cannot afford to protect themselves because they do not have an income coming in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conservation movement has started to realise that the Labor Party has no real interest in it. Their romance was just a vote catching exercise. When the former Minister, Senator Richardson, was removed from the environment portfolio he changed very dramatically. We all knew that at that stage the green vote no longer counted to the ALP. This legislation is a mishmash which basically pleases no-one. The green vote says that it is unhappy and the timber industry says that it is unhappy. The amendments moved by the Opposition offer genuine resource security to forest development projects, irrespective of size, and they also give environmental security. I think that needs to be remembered when looking at the way our amendments are framed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition supports the notion of resource security. We have said repeatedly that if the legislation is properly drafted, and takes into consideration the concerns of all sectors of the industry and conservation groups, we would support it.

There would not be one member of this chamber who would put money into something where he or she did not have some security in knowing that the Government was not going to come down heavy-handed in the next little while and take away the chance of multiplying that investment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the timber industry is asking for is a chance to invest, to make money for Australia, to give jobs to Australians and to make sure that we have a more prosperous country than we have got at the moment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government needs to listen to those in the industry who know a bit about it.

It does the opposite; it puts people out of work. I honestly cannot understand how people who have come through the trade union movement want to do away with jobs.

What I intended to say initially was that I am here today to speak on the Forest Conservation and Development Bill after a campaign of misinformation by the honourable senator's Government, and at last we have a chance to debate this matter in the chamber. It is fair to say that this Bill has caused this side of the chamber a fair amount of concern, and part of that concern has been the pressure we have had put on us by individuals who, I am afraid, do not understand fully the consequences of this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Tasmanian, I am acutely aware of the value of our forest industries to the general community. As a Tasmanian, I have experienced at first hand the political point-scoring that has characterised this Government's action in relation to access to our native resources. I have been told that Minister Griffiths, on the Judy Tierney show on the ABC in Hobart this week, had the audacity to call on Tasmanian senators to cross the floor and stop playing politics. We know who is playing politics in this particular fiasco. Our position is quite clear: we are supporting amendments put up by those people who are affected&mdash;the industry and the unions.

Even Senator Devereux gets a run in the press releases in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advocate</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Examiner</EMPHASIS>, and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS>.

There is not one word in any of those press releases about the industry view, not one word that says that the industry wants these amendments and knows that the legislation will not work without them. There is not one word anywhere here that puts the other point of view. If I ever had any doubts about the media, they have been put to bed now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day the question for us remains: do we support defective legislation, legislation which has been denigrated by the National Association of Forest Industries, by other forestry organisations that make up the industry and by trade unions and will provide no real benefit for the industry? Or do we maintain our stand that what is needed is genuine resource security, the resource security that is not guaranteed in the legislation before the Senate today?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall quote one of the Government's own members about this Bill. We need to look no further than the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 12 November last year, when a former Minister, Senator Peter Walsh, had this to say about this resource security Bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If words mean what they say, this seems to permit closing down a project at any time by ministerial fiat. Resource security takes on a distinctly Orwellian flavour.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us make it quite clear right from the start that this is payback legislation&mdash;nothing more and nothing less. It has been introduced by the Government to pay back for the crimes that have been perpetrated on the forest industry by the former Minister for the environment, Senator Richardson. We do not need reminding, but in the lead-up to the last Federal election the former Minister prostrated the Labor Government at the feet of the radical Green movement in a frantic attempt to gain Green preferences. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins would know that, in doing so, Senator Richardson left a trail of destruction amongst the forest industries of our nation. From Queensland to central New South Wales, to Tasmania, and even to Western Australia he made it quite clear that forest industries were not the flavour of the month as far as he was concerned. All he could see was green in one eye and green in the other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember a year or so ago, on one of my visits to north Queensland, going to Ravenshoe and having discussions with the families of the timber workers. I am pretty sure that Senator Richardson would remember his trips up there too. I talked to timber workers who had been thrown on the dole by the actions of Senator Richardson. Honourable senators may also remember the protest that occurred in September 1990 when 300 trucks surrounded this building, supported by almost 3,000 protesters who had travelled from all over Australia to express their concern about the manner in which they were being treated by this Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the former Minister's anti-forestry industry policy has had a number of consequences for Australia. First of all, it has lengthened considerably our dole queues. It has also worsened the dramatic recession we had to have. But perhaps the principal problem has been the total lack of confidence which is now apparent in the forest industry. Over the years, while Senator Richardson was grooming the Green preferences, he left those people who had a mind to invest in forestry in Australia thinking that it would be commercial suicide to do that sort of thing. Investors in those areas were left in no doubt that, no matter how thorough their investigations and no matter how sound their investment, there was always a chance that the Labor Party would put their project aside in a search for the Green preference votes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, as we stand here today, the industry has been almost destroyed by this approach. It is certainly suffering from a lack of confidence. As a result, the Government has brought forward this legislation, not with a genuine desire to assist the industry but because the Green preferences are no longer the flavour of the month and the Government is trying to get back on an even footing with the forestry industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we could trust the Government, we would not be here debating this legislation today. If we could believe that the Government's word was its bond, we would not need to have resource security legislation. Because its track record is so hopeless, we have this half-baked Bill before us today. Because previous Ministers have not been able to keep their promises, for whatever reason, unfortunately we must introduce legislation so that large wood processing projects which require a supply of natural resource over a period of time and which also require significant financial investment can proceed, knowing that their access to wood supply can be guaranteed. There certainly needs to be a requirement for State and Commonwealth governments to give undertakings that resources are available and the resultant products can be exported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it goes without saying that we also have a very active and very radical Green movement in our country which seeks to stop altogether the logging of native forests. We have heard from Senator Coulter today and I note that, in a media release in Hobart, the leader of the Green Independents, Dr Bob Brown, said that the Bill would have a devastating effect on both the environment and the economy. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It entrenches the appalling situation where some five million tonnes of Australia's native forests are being woodchipped and exported.</PARA>
<PARA>One can always guarantee that, whatever the Bill, whenever timber is mentioned, Dr Brown will come up with some new forest or some rare species or something that is going to suffer because someone in this country is trying to do something positive. My colleagues from Tasmania must get sick and tired of hearing the same old thing all the time. I do not know where he gets his figures from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essential point I would like to make is that resource security legislation should be unnecessary and it would be unnecessary if the Government had been genuine in its dealings with the industry. Those are not just my words; they are also the views of Simon Crean, Senator Button, John Kerin and Alan Griffiths, who put their own words together in a submission to Caucus. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a perception within industry, the trade union movement and the community, that the Government has no clear process to handle forest disputes and guarantee that certain forests are available for value adding activity.</PARA>
<PARA>That is correct. As evidence, I quote from a copy of a letter that I managed to get hold of today. A foreign timber investment company had been looking to invest in Australia. Writing to one of its associates in Australia, it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have decided not to show any expression of interest at this time as we are not confident that the Australian government will continue to permit the cutting of natural hardwood forests in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA>No-one has any confidence in putting their money into forestry in Australia&mdash;and why should they, having seen all the broken promises and the backsliding that this Government has been up to?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the legislation is related so closely to what is happening in Tasmania, I believe it is important that we review what has happened in my State over the years in which this Government has been meddling in our forest industry. Just for the record, over the last 15 years, we have had 11 separate inquiries into the forest industry in Tasmania. This has involved all sorts of things, including a huge number of memoranda of understanding which have been tossed aside by the Federal Government when it has been convenient for it to do so. I also remind the Senate of the decision by the Federal Government not to log the Lemonthyme, which saw another valuable resource locked away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent example of this Government's meddling in the Tasmanian forestry industry was in March 1989 when Senator Richardson made that great decision to block the Wesley Vale project. That cost many jobs in a sadly economically depleted area of the State, as Senator Sherry would know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Forest industries are certainly a very vital part of the future of Australia. Around $4 billion of private investment is purported to be on hold because of this Government. At the same time, our external trade account for wood and wood products is in deficit, with imports exceeding exports by $1.6 billion in 1989-1990. This comprised total imports of $2,126m and exports of only $523m. The main categories of our imports were paper and paper board, which comprised $1,018m, sawn log of up to $463m and pulp and waste paper of $240m. Exports for the corresponding period were only $356m in woodchips and $1.8m in paper and paper board. This shows, without any shadow of doubt, that there certainly is a much needed opportunity for Australia to become further involved in the downstream processing of forest resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred earlier to the manner in which this Government has chosen to play cheap politics over the issue of resource security. I want to take this opportunity to place on record, once again, the coalition's strong commitment to supporting genuine resource security.

When I said, `Well, in that case I seek leave', Senator Button simply said, `No'. The whole thing was totally unsatisfactory and I hope we do not see a repeat of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Briefly, I am forced into the position today to make the statement that I would have made yesterday concerning the misstatements that Senator Button made about the Fightback package. I find it fascinating frequently as we sit here in Question Time to see that Senator Button seems to have no knowledge of the Government's own policies, but he seems to espouse the idea that he has knowledge of ours. I think it is important that we place on the record the correct statistics of the havoc that has been wreaked by this Government and its policies and the fact that the Fightback package offers hope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first statistics I want to put on the record are these: first of all, we now have 218,000 children who live in families where nobody has a job at all. There are almost 250,000 Australians who have been unemployed for a year; that is a staggering 88 per cent increase in a year. There are now 500,000 children who are living in poverty and there are 75,000 children who have no homes at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that as a background, we look at the competing proposals to bring about recovery in the Australian economy and to see hope restored to the Australian people. The Fightback package promises to abolish seven taxes, which will lower the impost on business by $20 billion. It is a package that promises to give back to taxpayers $13 billion of their own money which is now collected by way of taxation. It is a package which, in fact, funds that restructuring of the tax system by the use of a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole of the restructuring of the tax system is prompted by two fundamental principles&mdash;the principles of logic and equity. There is no equity at all in the present tax system. It has resulted in an all time low ratio of savings and we have been forced to go into international debt. Because we have not had enough savings here to finance what we have needed to do, we have gone overseas and borrowed other people's savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to look at the way the current tax system affects the ordinary household and why the question of tariffs has become relevant and how that affects the ordinary household.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take the figures and analyse the impact of the wholesale sales tax, the petrol tax excise and the tariff tax, otherwise known as customs duties, that are imposed on this society, we see that overall they cost Australian families about $45 a week. We can directly say that tariff tax&mdash;and that is what all customs duties are&mdash;costs an average family about $16 a week and is responsible for collecting about 3.6 per cent of total revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To look at just how this impacts on families, I give the example of a pair of shoes that is imported into this country. That pair of shoes will be bought by a family at the bottom end of the financial spectrum&mdash;one of the 42 per cent who earn $20,000 or less who will get no tax relief under the so-called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS>&mdash;better named the `No Nation'&mdash;statement. But these people are penalised by the way the tariff tax system works. A pair of shoes with leather uppers imported at a wholesale free-on-board price of $10 will attract a duty&mdash;under the base quota&mdash;of 50 per cent; that is, $5. If we then add in freight, insurance and handling costs of $1, a wholesale margin of, say, $3.20, and a retail margin of, say, $8.60, we find that the final consumer price is $27.80. In other words, the duty or the tariff tax that is imposed represents a consumer tax of 18 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that same pair of shoes were imported outside base quota&mdash;under tender quota&mdash;we would find that the tax would be anything up to 23 per cent. The people who need to be able to have access to low priced goods, who need to be able to buy shoes, clothes, children's shirts and dresses for their youngsters at a reasonable price, are being penalised. This Government talks about equity and justice, yet it has imposed upon the Australian family a harsh and unconscionable tax regime whereby, since it has been in office, it has ripped off the taxpayer by increasing the tax take by 34 per cent. No wonder we got a surplus in early Budgets: we got it simply because we wreaked more tax on the individual taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wholesale sales tax has been put up three times. From that tax, the Government used to collect around $3 billion; now it collects $9 billion to $10 billion. Never once did the Government actually have the courage to go to the people at election time and say, `Our policy is to increase the wholesale sales tax and to increase the tax take and we would like you to judge us about that.' Oh, no, they were hidden. The Government has had its own GST for a long time. It has been the Government's secret tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Government came to power the fuel excise was 9c a litre. What is it now? It is 26c a litre. We are giving it back, so that every time people go to the petrol station to fill up the family car with petrol, they will be about $10 or $11 better off; in other words, that is how much less it will cost them. Of course, the people who are in business will get a deduction of 26c a litre, because it will be an inputs tax and they will be entitled to a refund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great lie that the Government puts around is that somehow the tax restructuring is merely to impose a new tax upon existing costs. Wrong! The restructured system will mean, once all those taxes we are abolishing are gone&mdash;and we are keeping the Prices Surveillance Authority to ensure that that occurs&mdash;the 15 per cent will be imposed at that much lower cost. Those who do their sums&mdash;some people are better at doing sums than the Government is&mdash;will see that the net result is 4.4 per cent. We can even read that down to 2.2 per cent, if we want to apply the implicit price deflator. But that is not something people readily understand, and so we take the conservative figure of 4.4 per cent. So that nobody is disadvantaged, the people who are getting refunds through the tax system will benefit by having more money in their pockets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under our system a taxpayer with an income of $30,000 will get $30 back by way of a reduction in tax, but under the Government's `No Nation' statement all he will get is $15. Of course, if he earns $20,000 or less, he gets sweet nothing. Indeed, our incentive package will allow 95 per cent of all taxpayers to earn double the income of $30,000 and pay no greater rate of tax&mdash;incentive is built back and so is the will to save. Those people who are outside the tax system&mdash;those who depend on pensions&mdash;will be compensated by an increase in the pension rate of 8 per cent; and for special benefits, 6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real point I want to make is about tariffs. We have said that we will reduce tariffs so that they have negligible effects by the year 2000. We have said that we will do it at the same time as we are reducing the costs of doing business&mdash;micro-economic reform&mdash;and that the reductions will be transparent and known about. I have said that the whole package is driven by logic and equity. Those are the reasons we want to see those people who need to have access to goods which are cheaper get access to those goods and not be penalised by the current tariff regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing fair about the current tax regime. It has led to an all time low savings ratio. It has led to an unfair burden on sectors of the economy, with the wholesale sales tax being applied only to goods&mdash;things that are made&mdash;as distinct from services that are applied. We could understand that being the case in the 1930s, because most people were employed making things. Of course, these days they are not. Most people are employed in the delivery of services. So there is no logical or equitable reason why that should continue. Fairness and sense are our guiding principles, and the Fightback package stands up to those two tests on every test. The `No Nation' statement fails on every indicator. </PARA>

I refer to a regular column by the local Federal member of parliament, Mr Michael Cobb, the heading of which is `Keating's republic dividing the nation'. I am saddened to read the article because Mr Cobb uses in it some inflammatory language which is not becoming of him as a member of the Irish-Australia Parliamentary Friendship Association. The part that got to me when it was brought to my attention&mdash;and honourable senators will understand why it was brought to my attention&mdash;is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further motivation for the Prime Minister's outburst is his bog Irish streak, an unmaskable cultural imprint which has imprisoned him with certain prejudices and rendered him unable to rise above this irrational and paranoiac dislike of all things English.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is very unfortunate that Mr Cobb would use emotive terminology such as that. He has fallen into the trap&mdash;an English trap, or a British trap&mdash;that was set some time ago to denigrate the Irish as a race of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a deliberate political tactic by the British during the last century to publicise the Irish people as a race of people who had no brains, who were dumb, who were silly, and who could not be given control of their own nation. It was done with very distinct political motives and, to a certain degree, it was very successful. It continues, to a certain degree, to be successful, because we would all have heard from time to time these sickening Irish jokes that abound in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that Mr Cobb should now seek to use those inflammatory words, as the British have done so successfully for a number years, in this present debate about whether Australia should become a republic. I do not have to stand up in this place and defend the Irish people, who have made enormous contributions in the world of arts, literature, politics, economics, education and so forth, not only to this country but right throughout the world. In the area of literature and drama I could give names such as Joyce, Wilde, Yeats, Kavanagh and O'Casey, all names which immediately trip off the tongue when we are talking about that form of the classics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of politics, the Irish in this country have made enormous contributions. In my political Party, which is now 101 years old, the first elected Labor member of parliament was an Irishman&mdash;born in Ireland&mdash;by the name of Thomas Glassey. That tradition has continued to this very day. The Irish national contribution has not been restricted to the Australian Labor Party.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with sadness that I record the fact that the denigration of the race is just not justified in this day and age.

However, I am not going to respond to each and every comment that he makes in his article. I welcome his article because he is contributing to the debate on whether Australia should be a republic or whether we ought to change our flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of becoming a republic is not a new thing in this country. I want to quote a short paragraph from an excellent publication, which I would recommend to all honourable senators, called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Light on the Hill</EMPHASIS>, the story of the Australian Labor Party from 1891-1991, by Ross McMullin:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the 1880s there was a heightened awareness of the distinguishing features of Australia and its people. This nationalism was most frequently felt by radical dreamers. Many of Labor's early leaders were born overseas, mostly in Britain, and they inevitably retain the measure of attachment to the land of their birth; however, nearly all were keenly aware that Britain denied them hope, dignity and opportunity. In their adopted country they could help build a new society without having to overcome centuries of tradition and class rigidities. Further nationalist impetus came from a discernible restlessness with the British government's handling of Australian affairs. Some wanted to sever links with Britain all together: there were a number of Republican groups like McDonald's association in Charters Towers. Both a product and a propagandist of this developing nationalism was the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, a lively independent, assertively Australian weekly which began in 1880 in Sydney and became extremely popular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin's</EMPHASIS> masthead trumpeted `Australia for the Australians'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a new debate that we are having in Australia. It is, in my opinion, long overdue. Indeed, I look forward to the year 2001 and the earlier referendum, when I am confident the Australian people will determine that this country will become a republic in its own right. Mr Cobb's article went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Keating's vote of no confidence in the Australian flag is a sad indictment of his inability to transcend petty bigotry. His desire to have the Union Jack removed from our flag is less about the need for Australian independence than his own need to divert attention from the real issues affecting our nation. Our national symbol is distinctive, well loved and has served us well.</PARA>
<PARA>He is wrong on the first two counts. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was designed and approved by the Australian people themselves in 1901 from over 30,000 entries. It was not thrust upon us by some anglophile bureaucrat or politician, and most Australians remain proud and protective of it.</PARA>
<PARA>He is wrong on that last part as well. Mr Cobb is wrong on a number of the assertions he makes in the article. The design of the flag, which has been altered since then, was the result of a competition that was run prior to 3 September 1901, when the designs of the winning flag were displayed in the Exhibition Building in Melbourne. It was a competition that was run by the Commonwealth, which donated #75 towards the prize; by a newspaper called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Review of Reviews</EMPHASIS>, which also gave #75; and by the Havelock tobacco company, which donated #50. The prize was divided equally between five people, one of whom was from Perth, two from Melbourne, one from Sydney and one from Auckland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know who judged the competition. The winning design was announced by the then Prime Minister, Mr Barton, but it did not actually become official until February 1903, when it was announced in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth Gazette</EMPHASIS> that King Edward VII had approved the design of a flag for Australia&mdash;this is the British King&mdash;and also a flag for the Merchant Navy. In 1951 King George VI approved the recommendation by the Australian Government that the Commonwealth Blue Ensign be adopted as the Australian flag. It was not the people of Australia who made the decision at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The flag needs some analysis. Generally, when looking at flags, the distinguished people who can break them down and give advice on them divide a flag into four parts. They call them the canton, the second quarter, the third quarter and the fourth quarter. The canton is described thus:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The place of honour in a flag is the upper half of the hoist. It is also called the First Quarter and sometimes the Upper Hoist.</PARA>
<PARA>On the Australian flag, the thing that is displayed in the upper hoist or the canton of the flag is the Union Jack&mdash;the flag of the United Kingdom. That is not ours, and it is certainly the most dominant part of the Australian flag. On the third quarter, the lower half of the hoist, is depicted the seven-pointed star representative of the six States of Australia and the Territories. It is significant that the Union Jack is uppermost, and that the thing that depicts the country of Australia is actually resting below it. The other thing that is featured on the flag is the Southern Cross constellation, and that is actually broken up between the other two quarters of the flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome, and have welcomed for quite some years, the debate on whether or not Australia should become a republic.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment briefly on the contribution from Senator <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>McKiernan before I go to the substance of the remarks I wish to make today. I was interested to note that he singled out Mr Cobb for his attack on the Irish. I have not read Mr Cobb's article. Senator McKiernan is entitled to criticise, but he must ask himself whether he is not applying dual standards in this matter. I recall that it was Mr Keating who opened up the debate, with guns blazing on the English. I suspect that, if Mr Keating wishes to play it that way, the community will respond in like manner. That is one aspect of the debate that I think is rather unfortunate and it got it off to a rather poor start. I was waiting to see whether the honourable senator was going to apply a single standard or whether he was going to apply dual standards in relation to the behaviour of Mr Keating and the attack on Mr Cobb.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One aspect that worries me a little is that we are bringing in a lot of the prejudices of the old world. I was interested to see whether Senator McKiernan could adduce any reason why we should change what is arguably one of the world's great constitutions. I listened carefully and all I heard was a fairly vigorous attack on the British, the English, and a bit of history. It was certainly interesting. I listened carefully to see whether he could adduce any reason, apart from any natural old world feelings he might have towards the British, why we should change what is by any standards a remarkably successful Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was reminded some months ago by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, that Australia is arguably the world's oldest continuing democracy. We have worked with our Constitution for 100 years. When one views the countries around the world that are trying to establish what we established almost a century ago, one wonders whether our founding fathers did not get it pretty right. Like Mr Keating, I happen to take a great pride in the history of our country and its achievements. I suspect that one of our achievements is our Constitution and its role in maintaining the unity of our nation. When people, in a fairly flippant manner and for totally fallacious reasons, attack this achievement, of course people are going to respond. I note that Senator McKiernan welcomes the debate. The debate will certainly continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to speak today about a matter that has some meaning to me. It concerns the death on Tuesday of F.A. von Hayek, who died at the age of 92. Hayek was an eminent economist, political philosopher and scientist. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for economics in 1974. Hayek was certainly one of the most influential thinkers of the twentieth century. He ranks with John Stuart Mill and Adam Smith as great liberal thinkers who have had a profound effect upon the development of the liberal democracies of the Western world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great intellectual battles of the twentieth century has been between liberalism and socialism, between freedom and totalitarianism. As Marx was the inspiration for the socialists, Hayek was the great liberal thinker who helped stop and ultimately turn back the onrush of socialism. In a sense, as Marx was the founder of the old socialist states of eastern Europe, Hayek is in many ways the founding father of the new democracies in Eastern Europe. When Hayek wrote <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Road to Serfdom </EMPHASIS>in 1944, socialism dominated the academic world. There was the view that capitalism had had its day. When one opens the covers of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Road to Serfdom</EMPHASIS>, it is interesting to read that it is dedicated to the socialists of all parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the two years I have been in this Parliament, I have heard no-one defend socialism. The dedication that Hayek made has clearly been heard. I have to say that, to the extent that the Labor Party has managed to rid itself of the dead-end of socialism, its members should be profoundly grateful to Hayek. The more they have absorbed the philosophy of Hayek, the more likely the Labor Party is to have a future. It is now almost 50 years since <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Road to Serfdom</EMPHASIS> appeared and attacked the basic principles of socialism. The book demonstrated that centralised economic and socialist types of policies were incompatible with democracy and led inexorably to the destruction of individual freedom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of Hayek's other great books, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Constitution of Liberty,</EMPHASIS> published in 1960, is still quite widely read. Many of his statements seem particularly relevant to some of the problems we are facing in Australia. For example, on trade unions, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Public policy concerning labour unions has, in little more than a century, moved from one extreme to another. From a state in which little the unions could do was legal if they were not prohibited altogether, we have now reached a state where they have become uniquely privileged institutions to which general laws do not apply. They have become the only important instance in which governments singly fail in their prime function&mdash;the prevention of coercion and violence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It cannot be stressed enough that the coercion that unions have been permitted to exercise contrary to all principles of freedom under the law has primarily been the coercion of fellow workers. Whatever true coercive power the unions may be able to wield over employers is a consequence of this primary power of coercing other workers; the coercion of employers would lose most of its objectionable character if unions were deprived of this power to exact unwilling support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is an extract from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Constitution of Liberty </EMPHASIS>by Hayek. He made this quite prescient observation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . .labour unions cannot in the long run substantially alter the real level of wages that all workers can earn and are, in fact, more likely to lower than to raise them. . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting that one of the proudest boasts of the Labor Government under this accord is that it has been able to hold, and in a number of years cut, the level of real wages. Hayek was remarkable not only for the profound defence of the free society but also for his willingness to help organise to promote his views. In 1947 he formed the Mont Pelerin Society and he helped found an influential think-tank, the Institute of Economic Affairs, in London. I can well recall when I was at the university&mdash;and perhaps Senator Ray can recall it, too&mdash;how avidly the IEA pamphlets were read. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that Hayek had a very important influence on the thinking and work of free market think-tanks in this country. My father, who was one of the founders of the Institute of Public Affairs, wrote a tribute to Hayek that was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian </EMPHASIS>yesterday. He recalled about <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Road to Serfdom</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . immediately became the bible of those of us who clung to a belief in a liberal philosophy and a market economy in the face of mounting assaults from academic economists and socialist politicians.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Road to Serfdom</EMPHASIS> was a beam of light on an otherwise dark and threatening horizon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hayek visited Australia in 1976. His visit was sponsored by the Institute of Public Affairs. Hayek and his wife stayed for a number of days at my father's home in Mount Macedon. He was at that time 77, still physically fit and intellectually vigorous. As an indication of Hayek's breadth of learning, my father recalls that he took a copy of Tolstoy's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">War and Peace</EMPHASIS> from the bookshelves and commented, holding the book in his hand, that this was the best translation of Tolstoy's great work that he had read. He said that he had read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">War and Peace</EMPHASIS> in a number of translations and was about to read it again. As my father commented, most of us would have been pleased that we had read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">War and Peace</EMPHASIS> once. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hayek also mentioned to my father that, soon after the publication of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Road to Serfdom</EMPHASIS>, he encountered Winston Churchill at a function. Churchill told him that he had just read his book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Road to Serfdom</EMPHASIS>, and Churchill said to Hayek, `You need not worry, the British people will never travel down that road'. Churchill was wrong. The fact of the matter is that the British people did start to travel down that road. In Australia Chifley was determined to lead Australia down the socialist road which, Hayek warned us, would lead us to socialism and serfdom. Fortunately, there were individuals and governments prepared to resist this trend. Hayek's warnings were heeded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another organisation closely associated with von Hayek was the Centre for Independent Studies in Sydney. Hayek was a member of the centre's advisory board from 1977. Greg Lindsay, a friend of mine who is Director of the Centre for Independent Studies and who happens to be a prominent member of the Mont Pelerin Society, was able to organise for that society the Sydney conference in 1985 and the Christchurch conference in 1989. Greg Lindsay acknowledges the great impact that Hayek's thinking had on him personally and on the work of the Centre for Independent Studies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world today would probably be a very different place if it had not been for the work of F.A. von Hayek. It is therefore appropriate that his life's work be recognised in the Australian Senate today. </PARA>

He would not be part of the scaremongering tactics in what is going on, would he? He has a little bit of honesty in him, so he will put out a press release too, and he will say that in fact they have got it wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to the scare tactics, the misinformation, being perpetuated in the Australian community at the present time. I will refer particularly to some of the Government's masters, or what I call the stooges of the Labor Party. First of all, I wish to refer to the Electrical Trades Union and what it has recently published in its magazine. In that magazine a Christmas basket of 26 items was selected, and it was said, quite correctly, that the bill for that would come to $2,168.58. Then it was claimed, quite incorrectly, that under <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback</EMPHASIS> it would cost $2,491.57. In doing so, the union made a fundamental flaw and attempted to mislead the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where did it mislead? It did not take into account that under <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback</EMPHASIS> the wholesale sales tax would be removed; nor did the Electrical Trades Union take into account the impact, or the cascading effect, of abolishing fuel excise and payroll tax and of our tax cuts when 95 per cent of taxpayers will pay 30c or less in the dollar. All taxpayers will benefit under our Fightback program. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And pensioners, yes. That is quite different to the Government's proposal in the One Nation statement whereby low income earners get no relief. It is worth having a look at that, because we find that under <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback</EMPHASIS> the tax-free threshold will be raised from $5,400 to $7,000 but that under the Government's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> there is no increase in the tax-free threshold.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look a little further we see that, under <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback</EMPHASIS>, people earning between $7,000 and $20,700 will be paying income tax of 16.2 per cent in the dollar. We find that under the One Nation program, there is no tax relief. If we examine the ETU's proposals, we find that when we deduct the wholesale sales tax, which applies incidentally to 21 of the 26 items, we have to deduct $285.93. That is the Government's GST&mdash;the Government's own secret tax. The package without the wholesale sales tax comes to $1,880.65. Under <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback</EMPHASIS>, with the GST, it amounts to $2,162.75, which is $3.83 cheaper than it is with the wholesale sales tax items in. One has also to add to that the fact that fuel excise is removed and payroll tax is removed. The cascading impact on these items will mean that that package will be even cheaper than that straight analysis and, because of that, it will have the capacity to generate more jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that needs to be brought out, in terms of this misleading, incorrect article and the statements that are being made by the stooges of the Labor Party, is the comment made by Mr Peter Tighe, the secretary of the ETU. He said, `If Hewson is serious about 15 per cent tax, why does he not legislate?'. Let me inform Mr Tighe, and members on the other side of this chamber, that we are legislating for the 15 per cent. This says that we cannot trust the Electrical Trades Union to give a fair representation of the facts, in terms of the current economic packages before us, any more than we can trust the current Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to go a little further and refer to the scare tactics and the scaremongering that the Seamen's Union is involving itself in. I particularly want to refer to some material that was put around the electorate of Swan in Western Australia last week and also the Ashburton State electorate. It just shows that Mr Beazley, the honourable member for Swan, is running scared when he has to have stooges going around the electorate delivering the sort of material we are seeing. What we see here, and it is here for all to see, is a simulated $5 note, except that the $5 has been scratched out and $4.25 has been put in. A group of items has been selectively chosen on which they have misrepresented the price, in terms of the goods and services tax or our tax reform proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, like the Electrical Trades Union, the Government has chosen not to make any allowance for the changes in wholesale sales tax, the payroll tax, the training levy or any of the other secret Government taxes I have already mentioned. The shopping basket that has been chosen has no direct wholesale sales tax on it. The union has tried to be too smart for its own good. It has not taken into account&mdash;and I am sure that members of the Government are intelligent enough to know it&mdash;the fact that under our package the indirect impact of the wholesale sales tax on the manufacture of these goods&mdash;butter, sugar, potatoes, bread, et cetera&mdash;flows through in the price. In addition, the wrappings that go around these items, whether it be the butter, the sugar, the potatoes, the coffee, the bread&mdash;one could go on&mdash;all have wholesale sales tax applied to them at different rates. So there is another total misrepresentation of the facts with regard to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They then proceed with a further simulation of a $5 note and pretend that it will be worth only $4.25 when we come into government. How wrong they are. But worse than that, Mr Beazley's stooges make further misrepresentations. They say, `Alston&mdash;no security for social security', which is a lie; `Dr Woods&mdash;no Medicare', which is a lie; `McLachlan&mdash;multinationals before farmers', which is another lie. One could go on with what they say about Mr Howard, Mr Fischer and Mr Reith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make particular reference to Mr McLachlan because of my personal interest in farming and the close association I have with the mining industry. I point out very clearly that under our proposals, which are not included in the Government's One Nation program, we will be removing close to $2 billion of the input taxes from the farming and mining industries&mdash;the very people the Seamen's Union is talking about, the very industries that provide most of the wages that keep members of the Seamen's Union in their jobs. This five-dollar note is a total misrepresentation. In fact, it is quite bizarre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do not create a climate in this country in which our miners, our farmers, our manufacturers and others in the community are profitable, if we do not take the input taxes away from them, these very people, the members of the Seamen's Union, will have fewer and fewer jobs. By removing the input taxes such as the fuel excise, the payroll tax and the wholesale sales tax, our manufacturers will become more internationally competitive, whether they are manufacturing through value adding or whether they are manufacturing through mining or producing wheat, wool, cauliflowers or whatever the agricultural product might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other aspect I wish to raise is the international signal that this sends. There would be no Seamen's Union unless there were goods and services going across the wharves. Our exports particularly are what provide them with the opportunity for work. What they have done in this article is to send a false signal to investors into this country, saying that a coalition government would devalue the dollar and lower the value of any investment they might make in this country. That really is quite bizarre. It is quite unnecessary. It is the wrong signal to be sending out of this country. It is a totally irresponsible act. The Minister for Shipping and Aviation, Senator Collins, from the Northern Territory, who is at the table, has a very close interest in the capacity of the Northern Territory to export goods to get development investment into the Northern Territory and in a number of other matters. I hope he will dissociate himself from anybody who tried to present, incorrectly, to the Australian public or to the businesses of this country that there was an endeavour to erode the value of our currency and of our base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that in the lead-up to the next election we can expect to see many attempts to mislead the Australian public on a variety of issues. I would say to honourable senators on the other side that there is no doubt in my mind that the Electrical Trades Union and the Seaman's Union are the stooges of the Labor Party. I have no doubt that they, or a number of them, and Mr Beazley in Swan knew that this misinformation was going to be put around. They have a responsibility, as elected members of the Australian Parliament, at least to bring a little bit of honesty to the current debate in terms of the economic direction of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that I think Senator Crane's wish to bring honesty to the political debate over the next 12 months is a forlorn hope which will not be fulfilled. One need look only to the track record of this Labor Government in terms of honesty. We all remember the promises that no child would live in poverty by the year 1990, that there would be no recession, that we would have a soft landing, and the promise made by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, about a year ago: ` Don't worry. The recession will be over. It will not be too bad. It is only a bit of a downturn; she'll be right'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to honesty&mdash;which is, in politics, only a relative judgment of someone's credentials&mdash;certainly the Federal Government has proved to the Australian people over the last year that it would be very low down on a relative scale. This was reinforced for me on a visit to Karratha last week, when I picked up a copy of the Karratha <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guardian</EMPHASIS>, an august publication which serves some very important people in the north of Western Australia&mdash;a region, as Senator Crane said, that the Minister at the table, the Minister for Shipping and Aviation (Senator Collins), is very familiar with. I was horrified to read an analysis of the GST's impact on the north prepared by that well-known economic analyst, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, Graeme Campbell, and a State candidate for the Australian Labor Party&mdash;although he is trying to hide the fact that he is a candidate for the Labor Party&mdash;a Mr Fred Riebeling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have done an analysis of the impact of the GST on a special little basket of groceries in a Karratha grocery store.

Have they applied Treasury's analysis of what the GST will do to a bottle of milk? That is what they said to the people of Karratha that they would do. What percentage did they choose to put on the price of a bottle of milk?  They chose 15 per cent. What did they do to the price of 500 grams of butter? Did they use the Commonwealth Treasury analysis to say what the price of 500 grams of butter will be in Karratha after the GST policy is introduced? No. They added 15 per cent. And what did they do to bread, steak, fish and eggs? They did the same thing to all of them.

Clearly, we are not going to have a rational or sensible debate on taxation policy between now and the next election. There is no way that the Labor Party can allow that to occur because its very own Prime Minister, who was the greatest supporter of the consumption tax in the Australian political debate only four or five years ago, knows damned well that if we have a rational, sensible debate about taxation policy, then the Australian people will support the shifting of the tax emphasis away from income and onto consumption to encourage savings and to create a fairer system where people know what tax they are paying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard of an example this morning concerning someone up north who was walking through a shopping centre in Karratha.

She said, `<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>No, it will not. It will go up by 15 per cent'.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are, as Senator Baume says, a number of items very important to many people which will come down quite considerably: for example, things such as soap, which is taxed at 20 per cent; shampoo, taxed at 20 per cent; a hair comb&mdash;probably something that Senator Baume does not use very often&mdash;taxed at 20 per cent; toilet paper, taxed at 20 per cent; toothpaste, taxed at 20 per cent; and deodorant, taxed at 20 per cent. All of those taxes come off. The people of Karratha do not even know that those things are taxed because this wholesale sales tax is a hidden tax. If this Government were dinkum, it would actually put the tax on the price tag to show the rip-off it is using. Of course, the Federal member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Campbell&mdash;my namesake, unfortunately&mdash;and the Labor Party candidate for the seat of Ashburton, Mr Riebeling, may not know what price effect the tax has on soap and shampoo and these other toiletries. Indeed, they may not even use these items, so they may not care. But the tax is the important thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other very important thing for the people of Karratha to understand&mdash;and it is something I am sure that Mr Graeme Campbell would understand&mdash;is the impact of the coalition's taxation policies on the cost of transport to remote regions. It is something that does need close analysis. Indeed, the best people to go to for analysis of the costs are the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) or the Prime Minister. I asked Senator Button a question many months ago&mdash;in fact, on 19 December&mdash;and he gave me the response on Monday, which is about Senator Button's average track record at the moment. The question related to the impact of the wholesale sales tax on the transport sector. My own specific interest, and the interest of my Western Australian Senate colleagues, is in the impact of the tax on transport to remote areas, and I am sure that is a matter Senator Collins would have concern with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised the question with Senator Button because I had had faxed to my office&mdash;incorrectly, I think&mdash;a paper prepared by a Caucus committee on transport policy which sought from the then Treasurer, Mr Kerin, some guidance on whether or not the Government would seek to change its policy on the impact of wholesale sales tax on the transport sector. That report, which quoted some figures from the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics, showed some indicative figures of the impact of wholesale sales tax on transport. It showed that wholesale sales tax adds approximately 2 per cent to the cost of operating a two-axle rigid truck. It also showed that there is about a 3.8 per cent impact on large articulated trucks and 4.5 per cent for a triple roadtrain. That cost&mdash;the impact of the wholesale sales tax on transport&mdash;cascades through the system of producing goods and delivering those goods to the end consumers; and, of course, the impact is increased as we move further and further away from the place of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In towns such as Karratha or Kununurra in north-western Australia, that wholesale sales tax has an enormous impact on the price of the goods when they reach the supermarket shelf, where the poor electors of Ashburton and the people who live in Karratha and north-western Australia generally&mdash;poor because of the impact of Labor Party policies over eight years&mdash;have actually to pay for the goods. More specifically, rather than talking in terms of percentages in relation to the impact of the tax on the price of food in the north-west, I spoke to one of the transport operators in Perth yesterday to ask what were the transport costs on food which travelled the route to Karratha. According to this transport operator, 22c per kilo of food is the transport component of getting that food up to Karratha. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course it does, but in terms of a rate per kilo, which is an important measure&mdash;I am sure the Minister would agree&mdash;the rate was about 22c per kilo. The impact of the coalition's tax reform policies on that 22c, by reducing the cost of fuel alone from roughly 68c a litre to 42c a litre&mdash;that is, a reduction of 26c a litre for transport operators&mdash;will reduce the cost of transport per kilo of food by some 27 per cent, or over a quarter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not take into account the impact of the cost of purchasing the rigs, or purchasing the major capital items such as batteries and tyres, and the other heavy capital costs of running a transport rig. That impact on the fuel cost will reduce the cost of delivering groceries to the supermarket in Karratha. Clearly, Mr Riebeling and Mr Campbell do not visit it very often. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make these points because it is very hard to analyse the specific impacts of tax proposals in far north Australia. But bear in mind that the wholesale sales tax system, on the admission of the Prime Minister, on the admission of Senator Button, and on the admission of the Caucus committee that is responsible for this, cascades through the system and hurts people who live further away from the place of production. Under this Government, we have a tax system, an indirect tax system, a hidden tax system, which severely hurts the people living in remote areas. With the goods and services tax, reducing income tax rates and placing the taxation emphasis on indirect tax has enormous benefits for the north of Australia. They are benefits that the Minister at the table will not admit because it is politically not sensible to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the beginning of this speech in supporting Senator Crane's calls for an honest and rational debate on the effects of the various taxation policies, it is indeed naive and stupid to suggest that this Labor Party and this Labor Government will allow any rational debate to take place. We must ensure that we fight fire with fire. If Ministers and Labor Party candidates in by-elections are going to go around to supermarkets and say, `This thing is going to go up by 15 per cent', then we as the proponents of the goods and services tax&mdash;the tax reform package&mdash;must go around to the supermarkets and say about cans of deodorant, toothbrushes and toothpaste, `These things will go down'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the long run, we must not only ensure that every Australian knows that the general inflation impact on the price of goods and services will not be in the order of 15 per cent&mdash;as these dubious characters from the other side of the chamber will go around Australia saying&mdash;but we must also support the Treasury's findings that the price impact will be somewhere in the region of 3.8 to 4 per cent. Of course, that is more than compensated for by the increases in welfare payments and the reductions in taxation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Arts, Sport, Environment and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 is an omnibus Bill, and I intend to direct my attention to the part referring to the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988. The Legislative Assembly for the Australian Capital Territory, in the 1990 report by its Select Committee on Self-Government in the ACT, in part addressed the issue of planning. It stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) has long expounded the view that the special planning, development, construction and administrative standards for Canberra cannot be separated in either functional or geographical terms. On this basis, the NCDC argued that it would be impossible to hand over complete control of these activities to a territorial government.</PARA>
<PARA>Because of the `duality of national and community interests', the Select Committee further stressed that, in the area of overall planning `there should also be involvement by elected community representation'. It said that it was therefore essential that there be adequate institutional arrangements for liaison and cooperation to closely coordinate and integrate the national community functions of the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been noted in another place, the purpose of the amendment is to introduce a ministerial power of direction in relation to the draft Territory plan, where the Territory Planning Authority continues to object to any aspect of the draft plan prepared by the National Capital Planning Authority, and to allow regulations to be made enabling the NCPA to charge fees for planning and related approvals. This power is to be limited to the recovery costs reasonably associated with planning approvals and not to be set at such levels as to amount to a taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this is a `housekeeping' piece of legislation which will improve ACT planning and land management, the Opposition does not dispute the Bill. In fact, it has set out to solve an impasse between the ACT Assembly and the National Capital Planning Authority.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very briefly, the Opposition has no objections to these amendments and will not be opposing them. However, there are some points which do concern us and which I should make. In the first place, the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990 is not an Act that has been around for a great deal of time and yet one notices, once again, drafting errors. Subsections 65A(1), (2) and (3) have to be inserted to provide the Agency with the standard taxation exemptions under Commonwealth, State and Territory law that were simply not given in the original legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to stress that we have been inundated at various times of the year, particularly towards the close of each session, with legislation that consistently requires fixing up because it has been made a mess of by this Government; and here we have yet another example of the need to correct quite new legislation simply because there is an error. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a matter I should raise in passing: new paragraph 70(1)(c) empowers the Agency to delegate the Agency's powers to `any employee of the Agency', as is now able to be delegated to the chairperson or the chief executive. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee has some views on that kind of delegation, and I just mention that in passing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act, new section 21B allows the Committee to approve a recommendation or report without the need to convene a meeting, and the new section requires all the members of the Committee, except those with a direct or indirect pecuniary interest, to sign the documents supporting the recommendation or report, with the recommendation or report to take effect on the date of the last signature. There is one problem about this: although the clear intention is that this should relate to those meetings of the Committee which take place on telephone link-ups, it does not specifically say so. In other words, there could be a situation, if this legislation is read as the words say, where people could agree in writing to a proposal, never having heard the case against it. That is simply intolerable and is not what is intended, as I understand, in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that it would have been better had the legislation clearly referred to such gatherings on the telephone, where the case for and against the Committee agreeing to something would of necessity be stated. We require, and I am certain that we will get, an assurance from the Government that that is the intention of the legislation. There are various other matters I would like to raise; I have not got time. The Opposition generally supports this legislation. </PARA>

Indeed, the results of that were seen at the time to the extent that they apparently frightened the Liberal Government from doing anything about tariffs over eight years. In so far as Government policy is concerned, the policy of the Government is articulated in terms of tariffs for TCF to the year 2000, for the passenger motor vehicle industry to the year 2000 and for other industry until 1996, reaching a level of 5 per cent for most industries at that time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Phillips, the soon to retire Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, yesterday confirmed the central bank's rejection of the coalition's monetary policy proposals. Mr Phillips, who is a man for whom I personally have great admiration, although he has not always been an unadorned admirer of this Government, or me, for that matter, has been seen as the Reserve Bank's chief anti-inflation hawk&mdash;the hardliner against inflation. I agree with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently described inflation at a metal trades industry forum as the worst enemy of Australian exporters. Inflation cannot be allowed to exceed that of our trading partners or we lose competitiveness.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, the Opposition would never be in a position to negotiate such an agreement. It has no wages policy, and would be forced to use higher interest rates to control inflation, as the shadow Treasurer, Mr Reith, recently admitted.

The summary of findings says in respect of employees' average weekly total earnings that the percentage change for all persons was 2.2 per cent for November 1991 from November 1990. It says that for full time adult average weekly ordinary time earnings the change was 4.2 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his question, Senator Harradine referred to the compositional change factors that affect this outcome. It is true that the effect of a recession in the labour force creates two clear changes. The first one is usually a tendency for workers who are full time employed on ordinary standard hours to be made part time as a prelude often, unfortunately&mdash;but not always&mdash;to redundancy. That, of course, reduces the amount of earnings that they receive. But they are, nonetheless, counted as an unit in the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other compositional factor is that if there are retrenchments or redundancies in a workplace, the tendency universally seems to be to retrench those on the lowest pay first, meaning that the average income per employed person increases. They are compositional changes which affect the outcome of these figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in the average award index for November was 2.9 per cent. So we cannot say that there is a direct correlation between average weekly earnings and average award increases. Average weekly earnings include all earnings, such as overtime, penalty rates and things of that nature. Average weekly award earnings reflect the base rate earnings at the award level. Traditionally, in the run-in to Christmas&mdash;and this is again represented in these figures this year&mdash;there is an increase as overtime picks up in terms of average weekly earnings over average award earnings.</PARA>

Does the Prime Minister's conversion extend to other industries which, like the Australian tyre industry, are also internationally competitive, such as the sugar industry, one of the most efficient in the world, and the dairy industry, which gives consumers the cheapest milk in the world? Will the Prime Minister give these industries an assurance that the tariff in the sugar industry will not fall on 1 July this year from $76 a tonne to $55 a tonne and allow a flood of subsidised sugar into Australia? Will the Prime Minister immediately reject any removal of the tariff quota on EC cheese until the present subsidy of $2,800 a tonne is removed? Will he give an assurance that there will be no further tariff cuts on primary industry products until the Uruguay Round is completed and other countries have reduced export subsidies, opened up market access for Australian products and reduced internal subsidies as required by the Dunkel proposal?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> has been remarkable in its reporting of the latest strike statistics. All other newspapers in Australia got it right when they said that on a working days lost measure this is the lowest for three decades; the lowest since 1962.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The 1991 figures are higher because of one particular distortion. That one distortion is called Premier Nick Greiner.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October there was a one-day union stoppage in New South Wales in protest against the repressive industrial legislation that the Greiner Government was trying to enact. The continuing confrontation of the Greiner Liberal Government created that type of social division and industrial upheaval in New South Wales. That is the solitary reason why the 1991 figures are higher. Therefore, it is not a reason that I, as the responsible Minister in a Labor government, regard as reflecting on the accord at all.

He said he would go away and find out. I asked him about it when I ran into him in the dining room one night. He said, `I will find out and get back to you'. He came in here with a brief and gave a union-type reply to my concern.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised by inquiries initiated by my ministerial office to APPM that it refuses to enter into talks or negotiations with any of the unions covering the workers protected by the agreements from which they have now withdrawn.

That is a responsible action of government. I make no apology to anyone for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether it be the unions or the employers who refuse to talk to the other&mdash;on this occasion it was the employers&mdash;I would still refer both parties to the umpire for their differences to be sorted out.

During Question Time today, Minister Collins made a statement in which he alleged, first, that I was dishonest and, secondly, that I had issued a press release in which I had stated that there would be no search and rescue facilities in north Queensland after the end of June.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government can offer no glee that search and rescue facilities would be available in North Queensland after the end of June, National Party Senator Bill O'Chee said today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Asked in the Senate at Question Time who would take over search and rescue operations if the North Queensland Emergency Response Group ceased operations at the end of June, the Minister, Senator Collins, replied:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator O'Chee pointed out however that no other group in North Queensland had the facilities to do the job.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The North Queensland Emergency Response Group is simply unparalleled in the area. There is simply no-one else who can feasibly do the job," Senator O'Chee said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I asked the Minister twice who would take the North Queensland Emergency Response Group's place and he just couldn't answer the question. That is because there is nobody else who can do the job.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Equipped with a helicopter, decompression chamber and Infra-Red search equipment, the North Queensland Emergency Response Group is one of the most sophisticated rescue teams in the State. Senator O'Chee said these facilities would be lost if the Government continued to do nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Senator Collins wants us to rely on his promise that somebody will take the place of the North Queensland Emergency Response Group, but he can't say whom," Senator O'Chee said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"If you are at sea in a dinghy, as three people were last week, a promise is not good enough&mdash;you want a rescue helicopter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Senator Collins' lack of answers as to who will do the job clearly shows he is all at sea when it comes to search and rescue," Senator O'Chee said.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the end of the press release. Nowhere in there have I said there will be no search and rescue facilities. In fact, I distinctly raise the possibility that there will be a service if the Government has the decency to keep the North Queensland Emergency Response Group going.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Tierney on 26 March 1992 relating to interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tierney's question was very straightforward. The question was: `Why does Australia have relatively high real interest rates compared with all other industrial countries?'. That is a very important question. A major factor behind this recession&mdash;the recession we had to have&mdash;was the very high level of real interest rates which absolutely devastated Australian industry. When one reads studies of the 1980s it is interesting to see that the interest rate levels in Australia were far higher than in other industrial countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem, which goes to the nub of the recession at the moment, is that interest rates in Australia are still very high relative to other countries. The Parliamentary Library pulled out some figures for me today which show, for example, in relation to corporate bond yields&mdash;and these are the latest figures&mdash;that interest rates in Australia are far higher than the 12 to 14 other industrial countries listed in the table. It is a very important question because it is one of the major reasons that it is so difficult to get industry to invest again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did we get from Senator Button? We got a very trivial, silly answer to this very important question. In broad terms, Senator Button said that real interest rates are derived by adjusting nominal interest rates for inflation. We all know that. But the question he was asked was, `Why are interest rates so high?' That question was put again by way of a supplementary, and Senator Button answered by launching into an attack on the Fraser Government. But the question remains unanswered. Why is it that in Australia we have corporate bond rates at the level of over 9 per cent, whereas in countries like Japan the rates are around 3.6 per cent, Switzerland 2.1 per cent, and Germany 3.6 per cent? Why is it that the level of real interest rates in Australia is so high? Senator Button did not give us the answer to that question today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cheek of the matter is that Senator Button has come in here on a number of occasions and alleged that under the coalition's Fightback package interest rates will rise. We know that the Labor Government's record is one of high interest rates over a very long period. The Australian people are entitled to know why that is the case. We know that Senator Button, his colleague Senator Tate and others are in possession of advice from Treasury which says that under the coalition Fightback package, interest rates will fall. Scare tactics were again used in Question Time today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will put forward a couple of reasons why interest rates in Australia are at record high levels. First, there is the record foreign debt. The reality is that foreign borrowers are simply not convinced that this Labor Government has any strategy at all to deal with the massive and continually mounting foreign debt in this country. Secondly, I believe that real interest rates are so high in this country because of what economists refer to as `inflationary expectations'. In other words, people are assuming that inflation will get off the ground again, that it will start to rise, and therefore adjustments are being made to the level of interest rates at which lenders are prepared to offer funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps a third reason for the record high interest rates is the uncertainty about the Government's fiscal stance. <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>There are concerns around that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will do anything to try to ratchet up the opinion polls and that he will expand spending. Of course, we are already seeing the Budget deficit blowing out. So the point I wish to make is that the question from Senator Tierney was very serious and very important. It was a question which Senator Button, as the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, should have been effectively addressing. What he gave us was a silly and trivial answer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He admits that that is true, and I can understand that because he obviously was not briefed. The significance of the action today was that the Australian Hospital Association, which represents all the public hospitals in Australia, joined with the Australian Private Hospitals Association in a joint statement slamming hospital Medicare. The public and private hospital sectors have joined in this unprecedented move in an attempt to save Australia's ailing hospital system from financial ruin. They have banded together and have called on the Federal Government to rectify the serious flaws in hospital Medicare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These two organisations officially represent over 80 per cent of the hospitals of Australia, and the 20 per cent which they do not represent are unrepresented by them merely because of the affiliation fees and the fact that the other 20 per cent are quite small hospitals with small numbers of beds, although large in number. I am sure that they completely support the thrust of what these two organisations are doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The influence of the public and private hospital sectors working together should not be underestimated by the Government. The Australian Hospital Association's National Director, Mr Peter Baulderstone, said today:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that we have got together should indicate to all that Hospital Medicare is under very serious threat and that changes need to be made.</PARA>
<PARA>I might mention that Mr Baulderstone was a member of Dr Blewett's staff when he was Minister for Community Services and Health. In a joint statement, the two major hospital groups said that the last two years have seen a decline in Australia's hospital system which can no longer be tolerated. Public hospitals are being asked to provide more services with fewer resources, and the demand for the public hospital services is increasing dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The private hospital system, now of the highest quality, is able to access only about one-third of the population. The situation is becoming worse day by day as Australians are forced to give up private health insurance or not take it up as the cost of private cover spirals in a time of economic recession. Only 41.9 per cent of Australians now carry private hospital insurance&mdash;down from 44.4 per cent only 12 months ago. This effectively means that another half a million Australians have been forced to rely on the public hospital system in the last 12 months, adding another $128m to the States' hospital bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the Federal Government's reply to these undeniable facts? The Federal Government appointed a committee; it appointed the Macklin review. What has resulted since the Macklin review was appointed? Nothing. The review has not resulted in any change to public hospital funding. The National Health Strategy paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hospital Services in Australia. Access and Financing. Issues paper No. 2</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the burden of the large increases in health insurance premiums falls inequitably on those high-risk groups who retain private health insurance, including the elderly and chronically ill. The burden is also borne by a significant number in the lower income groups in that 40.3% of the population holding private health insurance have incomes less than average weekly earnings (under $31,000 per year). This is contrary to Medicare's principle that the costs of hospital care should be `funded by all according to means'.</PARA>
<PARA>The review has been a convenient vehicle for the Federal Government to refer all complaints, concerns and criticisms of its Medicare policy, and it has achieved nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Private Hospitals Association and the Australian Hospital Association believe that Medicare's two main objectives&mdash;access for all Australians to high quality care on the basis of need, and funding of health services on the basis of people's financial means&mdash;are under serious threat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three fundamental concerns which are shared by the Australian Hospital Association and the Australian Private Hospitals Association. They are that public hospitals are under excessive pressure, private health funds are in a perilous financial position, and the rising cost burden of private health insurance falls unfairly on pensioners and people on lower incomes. They both believe that the Federal Government must radically alter the hospital financing system to ensure that pensioners and low income earners remain fully covered by Medicare whilst other Australians meet the full cost of hospital care through private insurance. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Committee's Report on the Examination of Annual Reports of June 1991 in which four recommendations were made. Those recommendations are reproduced below together with the Government's response on each.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the guidelines for both statutory and non-statutory authority annual reports be amended so as to require a section showing the pages of the report that conform with each requirement of the relevant guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Committee noted in its report, the revised Guidelines for the Preparation of Departmental Annual Reports contain a requirement that departmental annual reports are to demonstrate their compliance with the guidelines. At paragraph 1.12 the Guidelines also invite statutory authorities to comply where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government notes the recommendation and will take it into account in revising the reporting guidelines for statutory authorities. To the extent that non-statutory bodies (NSBs) produce reports of their own, rather than forming part of the parent body report, consideration will be given to incorporating a similar requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the practice of printing the letter of transmittal</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(containing an inaccurate date) within the annual report, be discontinued.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, on the occasion of tabling the annual report, the Minister provide a copy of the letter of transmittal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees that agencies and Ministers should be able to demonstrate their compliance with the statutory requirement that reports be furnished to Ministers by a certain date and tabled within a certain period after the date on which reports are received by Ministers. Agencies, in furnishing reports to Ministers, may, if they wish, do so under cover of separate (dated) letters. As the Committee report noted, the current departmental annual report guidelines include a requirement at paragraph 3.4 that Ministers indicate the dates on which their annual report was furnished to and received by them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the current guidelines for annual reporting by statutory authorities are revised, consideration will be given to incorporating a similar requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not feasible, however, to discontinue the practice of printing the letter of transmittal within the annual report. Whether or not reports are furnished to Ministers with separate covering letters, there remains a need for each report to incorporate a statement by the agency head certifying its compliance with (eg) section 25 of the Public Service Act. That statement should be signed and dated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An agency cannot accurately predict how long the interval will be between the date when the text of its report (including any letter of transmittal incorporated in it) is finalised and the date when printed copies are available to be furnished to the Minister. Nor can it be assumed that the date of furnishing will be the same as the date on which the Minister receives a report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That non-statutory authorities comply with the guidelines for such bodies and only conform with the requirements for statutory authorities as an extra; their reasons for doing so should be made clear in each report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government notes the recommendation, acknowledging that the current guidelines for departmental annual reports include specific requirements in relation to non-statutory bodies. These were set out in the Government response to recommendations of the then Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations in its report, Non-Statutory Bodies. The response was incorporated in the Senate Hansard for 8 December 1987, pp2645-7.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of that response is that information of certain kinds, which is set out in the guidelines, is to be made available either in annual reports of NSBs, if they produce annual reports of their own, or in those of their parent bodies. It is for the Minister to decide whether an NSB should produce separate annual reports of its own containing</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">required information, or whether that information should be contained in the parent body's annual reports. These requirements can be readily incorporated into the revised annual report guidelines for statutory authorities, imposing core obligations on NSBs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As there is no impediment to NSBs exercising a discretion to expand on the core requirements, the Government considers that any such additional information would be self-explanatory and would not require justification.</PARA>

<PARA>The document that we are now discussing relates to three reports&mdash;the reports of the Sugar Research and Development Corporation from 1 October 1990 to 30 June 1991, the Sugar Research Council from 1 July 1990 to 30 September 1990 and the Sugar Research and Development Corporation Selection Committee. Much of the detail in this document concerns some very scientific aspects of the industry, especially the section dealing with the Sugar Research Council. In spite of that, it is interesting to read all three reports as they relate to an industry which is of vital and essential interest to my State of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From Mossman in the north, the sugar industry is one of the vital industries to Queensland towns along the long coastal stretch. Like most other rural industries, this industry has been under severe pressure not only from the elements&mdash;all rural workers know that this is of vital concern&mdash;but also from the vagaries of the international market. What makes things worse for people in the sugar industry now is that, compounded with these problems, over which they have no control, we see the constant bombardment from Federal Labor government policies, which are slowly choking to death one of Australia's major industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently we have a situation where the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Research Economics&mdash;ABARE&mdash;has estimated that the value of the 1990-91 Australian crop was $752m. That represents a decline of 13 per cent from the previous season. This decline was caused by a 9 per cent decrease in crop production and a decline in the average value of the crop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is of most interest to those studying the industry is that this decline is despite an increase in assigned land area of 13 per cent over the past two seasons. Part of the decrease in production has been attributed to the dry and unfavourable seasonal conditions for cane growth in most regions. In 1990-91 there was a production of 25.2 million tonnes of cane from which 3.5 million tonnes of sugar was produced. Furthermore, a strong increase in world sugar production in 1990-91 and the build-up in stocks has led ABARE to conclude that world sugar prices will remain depressed in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the international scene, we have seen world sugar production rise by five million tonnes to 114.2 million tonnes in 1990-91. This is the second year in succession in which world production growth has exceeded 4 per cent. This increase was far in excess of the increase in consumption, which grew at less than 2 per cent, causing stocks to increase and prices to fall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">l notice that the situation of the industry during the period is described at page 8 of the report. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">International agricultural support policies especially in the EEC, USA and Japan continue to cause distortion of world agricultural commodity prices including sugar.</PARA>
<PARA>Distortion is an understatement. What it is doing, together with the blind faith this Government places on the fictitious level playing field, is not only distorting world markets, but also destroying Australian industries. Last month the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) spoke in the other place about the plight of the rural sector. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt, though, that some farmers have lost their equity. Many farmers are trying to hang on. It is tough. We have to make sure that we get the broader economic position right and try to minimise the effect of a world recession. It has often been said by those on the other side that we have been blamed for the world recession. If Australia, with its 18 million people, created the world recession in the United States and Europe, it has much more power and influence in Zurich and Europe than I know of. The fact is that we are in a world recession. Commodity prices are bad because of corrupted trade markets. The world does not owe us a living. The world is a tough place. Aussies are good fighters and I think that agriculture in Australia is going to take on a bigger and better role.</PARA>
<PARA>It is pertinent that he said that the world does not owe us a living. That is correct, but it also follows that we&mdash;and I stress `we'&mdash;do not owe the world a living. And that I regret is what we are currently doing. While agricultural producers throughout the world are being subsidised by their governments, being able to dump their goods at cheaper prices on our domestic markets, we are in fact supporting the world's farmers. </PARA>

<PARA>The year in question saw the passing of the individual grains research funding body set up in 1986 and the birth of a new corporation to cover the activities of 14 councils and committees. It is interesting to note what the report has to say about the allocation of funds through the year. In reading the report, two items came to my attention. First, a subcommittee of the Wheat Research Council was appointed to monitor farm risk management projects being progressed in South Australia and Western Australia. This is vital in the present circumstances of the grain industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second item that came to my attention was the Grains 2000 Conference put on by the Grains Council of Australia. Funding for this project was provided and a Council representative was appointed to the steering committee overseeing it. I would like to make one point about that. The conference was given very good and well researched material and it achieved a lot for grain growers. However, it was very expensive to attend. It was limited to those who had the money or who were given entree to it by being sponsored by the councils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to have functions such as Grains 2000, ordinary farmers should be able to afford to attend. It is a little like the Outlook Conference that ABARE put on at the beginning of the year. Unless the people in the community who produce the products can attend these functions, the message will not get through to them. They have to be affordable so that people can attend and learn. The bureaucrats stationed here in Canberra can also learn. People from around the world can then have the chance to meet ordinary Australian farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report states that the committee reviewed the projects being funded in research institutions in Tamworth and Wagga Wagga. Tamworth is very close to where I live. A magnificent job is done for the grain industry in that area. Wagga Wagga also does a great job. I commend the people who research and apply themselves to trying to make things better for farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed also that the committee accepted greater responsibility for the wheat and barley research programs in Queensland. That was done as a result of committee initiatives. More research organisations submitted projects for funding. Points were also made about wheat research. The report talks about consultation with farmers in the community and that is of paramount importance. I noticed that a lot more research into chickpeas and faba beans will be done. These two legume crops are part of cropping rotations that put nitrogen back into the soil. They keep the rotation going well. The soil is looked after. As custodians of our resources for future generations, most farmers want this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, I commend the members of the committee&mdash;Mr Don Blesing, the Chairman; Trevor Flugge; Michael Furzer; Tony Gregson; Professor John Lovett; Professor Donald Marshall and Dr Barry White&mdash;for the job they do in spending the research dollar. I hope that they do in the future what they have done in the past&mdash;that they make sure that the money put in the research funds by the growers is spent in a worthwhile manner. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to comment briefly on the report from the Department of Employment, Education and Training entitled `Higher Education Funding for the 1992-94 Triennium'. The report outlines funding decisions for this period and states that the Government's policies will enhance quality in the system and diversity in higher education. That is, of course, a very broad and sweeping statement by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) and his Department and it is blatantly incorrect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The education policies of this Labor Government are destructive, and the report clearly overlooks the chaos that has become the lot of the higher education system since the creation of Mr Dawkins's national unified system. As one would expect from DEET, this report claims that the enforced amalgamations within Australia's higher education system are a success. That is despite the continuing opposition from many institutions, such as the University of New England, and the intolerable overcrowding and overenrolment that exists in my own university at Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this report the Minister felt it necessary to make a statement on overcrowding and overenrolment problems. He is like Pontius Pilate; he wipes his hands of this matter, lays most of the blame at the feet of the institutions themselves and throws them inadequate funding to then deal with the problem. In his statement the Minister says that the Government will simply not provide additional funding for institutions which are above their target load, but will provide some assistance where the problems that have arisen are beyond the control of the university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the report states that almost all institutions are overenrolled. Secondly, I would have thought that the recession we had to have was definitely beyond the control of the universities. The universities could not have foreseen that this recession would have hit so hard and that, in a bid to avoid joining the 30 per cent of the rest of Australia's youth who are on the dole at the moment, so many people would have actually sought to continue studying. Here again, the Keating Government has let them down. A record number of 50,000 eligible students were turned away from university places this year. Surely the despair that would have been generated by this figure would be enough for the Minister and the Labor Government to see that their policies simply just are not working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With overenrolment in 1991 the institutions were forced to lower the number of offers. This report states that in 1992 overenrolments are now averaging 6.6 per cent. NBEET states that the problem is so severe that it is detrimental to the creation of a proper learning environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Government will not give the universities the flexibility they need to deal with these problems. If the Government is incapable of providing adequate funding, why should students suffer because of outdated ideology which discourages universities from seeking funding from other sources. The Government wishes to increase places in universities but the institutions are not receiving the funding that would allow them to expand to meet the increased demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Labor Government the funding of our higher education system has slowly been reduced as a percentage of GDP. Due to the Government's recession and the pressure that has been placed on universities to take more enrolments, the Government is not giving out the money that is urgently needed for capital works. Universities around the country are starved of facilities and resources whilst bursting at the seams, yet the Government clearly does not seem to care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's Fightback policies for higher education will give the universities the flexibility and freedom they need to meet the demand placed upon them as society attempts to pursue a better education system. This freedom is essential for world class universities to develop. Under a Liberal government the imposed uniformity of the national unified system will disappear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the Government continues to ignore the sound policies of the Opposition, and continues its interference with our higher education institutions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The report that is being considered by the Senate today is the seventh annual report by the National Crime Authority since it commenced operations in 1984. Quite early in the report it makes the comment that there is very little, if any, contribution from the Intergovernmental Committee. I think this is a relevant factor. I will comment a little later on the fact that the recommendations which were made by the Parliamentary Committee in its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to Guard the Guards?</EMPHASIS> have been held up, at least to some extent, because consultation with the IGC is not proceeding as fast as it possibly could.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the report, there is a number of matters I would like to raise briefly. One is the introduction of performance indicators for the National Crime Authority. This was one of the innovations introduced by its former Chairman, Mr Justice Phillips, who has just resigned. I believe it is a useful development. However, as this report indicates, we will have to wait and see whether the performance indicators which are being suggested&mdash;for an activity which is very difficult to measure&mdash;to establish efficiency and effectiveness are adequate. All we can say at this stage is that a start has been made in the development of a corporate plan and the setting down of some performance indicators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is also worth mentioning that the statistics published in the report which the Committee comments on indicate that the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 is working very well. Some $29m has been secured or frozen by the Authority since this strategy was developed. Clearly, this is a strategy which should be continued in the future and which holds out a lot of promise in the fight against organised crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph 23 of the report, on page 7, deals with some of the Committees's recommendations for amendments. The Committee notes a press report in which the `obsessive secrecy' of the Authority is slated. There are three chairmen mentioned&mdash;Mr Justice Stewart, Mr Faris, QC, and Mr Justice John Phillips. It is fair to draw attention to the qualification made by the Committee in that report&mdash;excluding the period during which Mr Justice John Phillips was chairperson of the NCA when  a great deal of cooperation was experienced by the Parliamentary Committee. Notwithstanding that, recommendations were made for amendments to ensure that the Committee&mdash;the parliamentary watchdog&mdash;can carry out its duties effectively. The Government's delay in coming to grips with the necessary amendments must be a matter of some concern. As I mentioned earlier, the consultation with the IGC appears to be dragging a little. That is at least one of the factors that are holding it back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To summarise, it was the view of the Committee that its members must be able to obtain information from the NCA to enable them to make a proper judgment on the work of the NCA. It is also conceded by the Committee that there must be certain safeguards, which have been identified. In other words, information which identifies persons in a matter which could be prejudicial to the safety or legal rights of those persons, information which could prejudice legal proceedings, and information which discloses the operational methods of the authority must be viewed as material that is confidential to the extent that members of the Parliamentary Committee may not disclose it. To the extent that the majority report and my recommendations coincide on these matters, I trust that the Government will see fit to introduce these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some divergence of view as to how a conflict of opinion could be resolved between the NCA and the Parliamentary Committee on whether certain factual pieces of information fall within one or other of these three exclusions. As I have set out in my dissenting report, I believe that a judge sitting outside the court system is the proper adjudicator in such a situation. I cannot see that the alternative put forward in the report&mdash;the suggestion that the Minister responsible for this area, the Attorney-General, should make the final judgment&mdash;is adequate since once again it brings the political sphere into the area of the judgment that needs to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since I have referred to the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to Guard the Guards?</EMPHASIS>, I wish to commend the secretariat, in particular, Mr Andrew Snedden, Mr Steve Curran and Tony Anderton who have done an excellent job both in that particular evaluation report as well as in assisting the Committee in putting forward these comments which examine the National Crime Authority's annual report for 1991. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Like Senator Spindler, I want to make a few brief observations on the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority on the NCA's annual report. I begin by commending Justice Phillips, who did an outstanding job as the Chairman of the National Crime Authority. His period of office undoubtedly represents a turning point for the Authority as one of Australia's principal law enforcement agencies. I am sure everyone on the Committee&mdash;and, indeed, in the Senate&mdash;is pleased to wish him well as the incoming Chief Justice for the State of Victoria. I also welcome Mr Sherman as the new Chairman of the NCA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Spindler said a few moments ago, Justice Phillips introduced many innovations in his period as Chairman of the Authority. Well do I remember the outlining of the program of the electronic courtroom which he oversaw a few months ago in Melbourne. Not only was the innovation valuable, but the electronic courtroom program was opened to the public and showed at first hand what the NCA was capable of doing as an agency that looked across the board in matters of law enforcement in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thoroughly endorse the recommendations in the Joint Committee's report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to Guard the Guards?</EMPHASIS>, about the proper role of the Joint Committee as against the role of the Intergovernmental Committee, the IGC. There is no doubt in my mind that the appropriate body for monitoring the National Crime Authority is the Joint Committee rather than the IGC. I think that is demonstrated by the quality of the observations drafted in the report before the Senate this afternoon by the Committee secretariat. I join Senator Spindler in paying tribute to the staff of the secretariat, particularly Mr Andrew Snedden, the Committee Secretary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IGC does not seem to have the inclination that the Committee has to work effectively as the monitoring body upon the NCA. There is no doubt that the relationship which currently exists between the Authority and the Joint Committee has not been better. I am sure that Senator Jones, who has served on the Committee longer than I, would endorse those remarks. Primarily that is a result of the NCA now being a much more open and accountable body. Much of that has to do with Mr Justice Phillips in a personal sense. As Chairman of the NCA he certainly made himself available to the media in the broad, responded to inquiries and questions, and was prepared not only to defend the Authority but to argue its case as a law enforcement agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the new corporate ethos of the Authority, as demonstrated by its performance indicators and performance plan referred to in the body of the report, has been impressed by the period Mr Justice Phillips acted as the Chairman. There is no doubt, as outlined in paragraphs 12 and 13 of the report before the Senate this afternoon dealing with performance indicators, that the NCA has now set a mission statement and nine clear objectives. There are now also criteria by which the Authority may be judged as a law enforcement agency. That takes into consideration the difficulties that exist in judging any law enforcement agency as against any private or government business enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report for 1993 the Joint Committee will be able to make a judgment of the performance of the NCA. There is no doubt that its role is changing in the current climate. There is no doubt that the NCA has a role to play as a law enforcement agency dealing with the dilemmas of the 1980s and with the excesses of that period. I refer to the white-collar crime that is only too readily apparent and the corporate abuses that took place in some sectors of business, industry and commerce during the 1980s. It is not only the Australian Securities Commission that has an increased role to play; the NCA also has a very definite role to play in that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make one observation about a problem area which the Committee is in the process of identifying&mdash;an area of which the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) are only too well aware. I refer to the witness protection program. There was the murder of Mr Mick O'Brien in Sydney recently. I pass no comment on that, other than to say that it highlighted the need for the witness protection program to be the subject of increased scrutiny at both Federal and State levels. There is no question either that we need a greater degree of cooperation between the Federal and respective State and Territorial governments in making certain that the witness protection program is of the highest order, not only in terms of the protection it affords people within it but also in terms of its aims and objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question that major breakthroughs have occurred in law enforcement matters in the United States as a result of the success of the American witness protection program. There is no question either that we can achieve results at least as beneficial to the community and as effective in terms of matters of law enforcement as the Americans have done through their various programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by drawing the attention of the Senate to paragraph 30 of the Committee's report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if the auditing function is to be removed from the Ombudsman, the function should be given the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.</PARA>
<PARA>To my mind, if a step is taken to remove the auditing function from the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the proper place for it is the office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. There is no question that the Committee agrees with that assessment. That is the most practical step that might be taken in the light of the removal of that power from the office of the Ombudsman. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`For much of its life under three chairmen&mdash;Mr Justice Donald Stewart, Mr Peter Faris QC and Mr Justice John Phillips&mdash;it has operated beneath a veil of obsessive secrecy'. There might be some merit in this criticism in relation to the early years of the Authority's existence. However, the criticism is both inaccurate and unfair in relation to the more recent past, especially the period when Justice Phillips was chairman.</PARA>
<PARA>Justice Phillips, during his chairmanship, laid down very careful guidelines for the way in which the Authority would open up its activities to the public. He created a position between the NCA and the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority that would allow greater examination of the activities of the NCA by the parliamentary Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the newly appointed Chairman, Mr Sherman, will not only continue in the same vein that Justice Phillips started during his period of office but will continue during his chairmanship to extend the public role of the NCA so that the public can be more aware of the activities of the NCA. I believe that the cooperation that has already been shown by Mr Sherman will continue to be shown to the parliamentary Committee. The parliamentary Committee will also be able to examine the activities of the NCA much more easily as a result of the way in which Mr Sherman has laid down the way in which matters should be dealt with. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a great deal of concern about this particular issue because it affects the whole of the community.

My examination of the observations made reinforces my view that more violence is coming through R-rated material and M-rated material than ever before. I shall give the Senate an example of some of the words that have been used in decisions by the Film Board of Review on appeals from producers of various films. For example, the Film Board of Review describes one such video as being `an orgy of violence with a grisly procession of blows, kicks, stabbings, shootings and graphic bone breakings' and having `no mitigating qualities'. That film was given an R-rated classification. The Board of Review said that some of the Film Censorship Board members thought it should have been in the M-rated category. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address the two papers released by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and listed as the first item. This Committee has published a paper in the series on the cost of legal services and litigation as part of the cost of justice inquiry. It is Discussion Paper No. 5 and it is on legal ethics. I wish to comment on three of the matters that are raised by Dr Parker in that particular discussion paper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is an extremely valuable one, bearing in mind the wide-ranging and searching inquiry that is being undertaken by the Cooney Committee on this matter. It is important that we try to illuminate every aspect of the legal system that contributes to the costs that litigants are faced with. A review of legal ethics is, I believe, a particularly appropriate exercise, bearing in mind that the area of legal ethics has grown over the years, starting almost from the Middle Ages. Certainly, some of the practices that are currently being followed by the legal profession could well do with some review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Parker raises in his report a whole lot of particular duties which, under the code of legal ethics, are intended to be observed by legal practitioners. I only wish to comment on those few in which I am aware some shortcomings exist. I refer in particular to the first item under the general heading of `Duties of Fairness'&mdash;the duty not to pursue hopeless cases, to enter hopeless defences or to cause unreasonable expense or delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a case that was recently brought to me by a constituent. The constituent had a legal dispute over an amount not exceeding $2,000, but the ultimate legal costs faced by her were of the order of $60,000. I believe that very much comes under the heading of `a duty not to cause unreasonable expense or delay'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another aspect involved in that which is relevant and that is the aspect of remedy. What does that particular solicitor's client now do, having been faced with this sort of a bill over a dispute involving an amount not exceeding $2,000? I might say that the case is in Victoria and the exact circumstances may differ from State to State. She has three options. First, she can accept what she would consider&mdash;and I would agree&mdash;an unreasonable offer of settlement. Secondly, she can apply to the Solicitors Board. But even if the Solicitors Board found that the solicitor was at fault or negligent, the limit of the remedy she could achieve would be $2,500, when she is faced with legal costs of $60,000. The third remedy she has is to engage yet another legal practitioner and go to court, charging her former solicitor with negligence or unsatisfactory execution of his or her duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, these are not satisfactory options. I believe that the review of the legal profession's ethics needs to include an examination of whether self-regulation in that instance is really working. In my view it is not. Clearly, we need to look at establishing an independent tribunal that can judge when clients of solicitors or barristers have a complaint and whether that particular complaint can be dealt with in an impartial way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to another duty that Dr Parker lists; that is, the duty to be loyal. That, on the face of it, of course, is a very admirable quality. It is also the basis of our adversarial system that a solicitor, a legal representative, pursues his or her client's case, right or wrong, particularly in, say, the industrial relations area or the area of family law. Another inquiry which is currently in progress has a lot to consider in terms of the costs that have to be faced by people who go through the Family Law Court system at a very traumatic time of their lives. So I think it is perhaps useful to look at whether our adversarial system works to the benefit of the clients of legal practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very often it may be possible&mdash;without making the whole change towards the inquisitorial system which is in place in Europe&mdash;to consider whether a mitigation of that duty to be loyal come what may could perhaps result in a legal practitioner acting for both parties in a mediator's role, trying to find a solution which overcomes the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third item I wish to address is the suggestion that we should look for a code of settlement; for a legal culture which tries all possible means of ensuring that the dispute is settled before it takes the time of the court and before it fixes the client with considerable expense. It was instructive to be told that, while on a national basis 5 per cent of all divorces finish up as a dispute that has to be adjudicated in the Family Court, in Tasmania the proportion is of the order of 1.5 per cent. We inquired into the reasons for that disparity and very clearly the small community contributes&mdash;lawyers can meet on a fairly regular basis. They can address the difficulties in a constructive manner by simply discussing how the problem cam be solved, rather than how the other side can be trounced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thoughts and suggestions that Dr Parker puts forward in this paper on legal ethics warrant the consideration of a much wider audience than just the Committee that is dealing with the cost of justice problems. It should be considered not only by the Senate, but also by the public in general and I am glad that the Committee has published this paper so that it may be circulated to a much wider audience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other paper I wish to comment on briefly is a background paper prepared by Dr Ian McEwen from the Research School of Social Sciences and Pacific Studies at the Australian National University which deals with access to legal services and the role of market forces. Also, Dr McEwen lists a number of areas where the legal profession can or should review its practices. For instance, amongst those areas he lists the desirability to reduce the extent to which certain legal services are monopolised by lawyers, and recommends that one should give greater access to paralegals in many areas which are currently being dealt with by the legal profession. Obviously, conveyancing and uncontested divorce cases would fall into that category. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The majority of the students are women, but they do not receive proper credit for their studies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991. I strongly support the remarks of my colleagues and urge the Government to accept the amendments proposed by the National Association of Forest Industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Archer said that he was interested to see that people were opposing these amendments. When I came into my office this morning my fax machine was thick with material from a very wide range of companies and individuals urging senators to allow this Bill to pass with the amendments proposed by the National Association of Forest Industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought that I would briefly bring to the attention of the Senate just two of the statements that I received today. One was from Slater Contracting Company. I understand that this logging and earthmoving contractor has written to everyone in the Senate. It says that it is a small logging business in the Eden area of New South Wales employing 14 people. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We urge you to accept the amendments to the above legislation as supported by the timber industry and unions so that we can once again employ trainees, increase our staff and also replace our ageing equipment which will give a much needed boost to our town and country and help get the economy going.</PARA>
<PARA>Hardys of Tumbarumba has put out a press release saying that it is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a softwood/hardwood sawmilling complex providing decentralised rural employment for 160 direct employees plus approximately 60 contract employees. . . .Hardys urge all sides of Federal Parliament to adopt the industry/Union amendments to the Federal Resources Security Legislation, which seek to protect existing jobs and investment, and encourage future investment in the sawmilling sector.</PARA>
<PARA>They are just two of the large number of representations and press releases which I have received. They sum up very nicely what this issue is about. It is an issue about combining a balanced conservation-forestry development program with jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleagues have pointed out, we in the coalition will support the amendments proposed by NAFI. As Bruce Lloyd, our shadow Minister for primary industry, and Fred Chaney, the shadow Minister for the environment, have pointed out, these amendments will make bad legislation more acceptable and provide some degree of security for this important national industry to invest up to $8 billion in timber as well as pulp and paper products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill reflect one major problem&mdash;factionalism in the Australian Labor Party and all that that has caused. One only has to look at the developments which have been held up in this country over the last eight or nine years; the jobs which have been lost in the mining and forest industries; and the jobs that have been lost in the tourist industry as a result of the mishandling of the pilots dispute. The list goes on and on. In a sense, we are now facing the symbol of the problems that this Labor Party has in managing the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Resources, Mr Griffiths, has said on the one hand that he is anxious to fast-track developments, including, of course, the development of a major new pulp mill in Tasmania. On the other hand, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, Mrs Kelly, is charged by the Labor Party with keeping the extreme greenies on side. She is determined to ensure that any jobs can be sacrificed for Green votes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All relevant parties want these amendments. I point out to Senator Sherry that the timber unions and the ACTU want these amendments as do industry associations and companies. I would have thought that is a unity ticket. We can add the State governments to the list of those that are prepared to support these amendments. If we can believe what Minister Griffiths has said and written on this topic, he should certainly be supporting these amendments to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is the Government so intransigent? Why are we having this refusal to accept the amendments which virtually all parties involved in the industry agree are important? As I said, it is a simple answer: when Australia's national interests conflict with influential interest groups in the Labor Party, narrow Labor Party interests win every time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Victorian senator, I have been able to witness first-hand in my State how the anti-development policies of the Labor Party have destroyed jobs and prevented new developments in the timber industry. Over the last 20 years in my home State of Victoria we have had detailed land use studies to determine appropriate land use classifications. Indeed, the Land Conservation Council, which played a key role in these studies, was an initiative of the former Liberal Hamer Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been comprehensive public consultation. The Victorian Government developed a timber industry strategy. But the intervention of the Federal Government in State land issues, notably in East Gippsland prior to the last Federal election, renewed uncertainty and undermined the State Government's own timber industry strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of the forest industry in Victoria under Labor is a history of lost opportunities, lost jobs and political hypocrisy on a grand scale. Let me give an instance of this. As a result of the policies of the Cain and Kirner Governments to burn residue wood rather than sell it for woodchips, Victoria has lost export revenue in the order of $100m a year. If this wood could be used in pulp mills, the value of these residue chips would be even greater. Royalties for the Victorian Government would have been in the order of $12m a year. A lot of education and community services can be financed from $12m a year, particularly in a State which has been bankrupted by the Labor Government. Yet, in order to appease the extreme environmentalists within its ranks, the Government has prevented the use of much of this valuable material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the other irony that while good pulpable material is burnt in Victoria, Australia is importing eucalyptus pulp from Brazil. It is interesting that after eight wasted years, Steve Crabb, the Victorian Minister for Conservation and Environment, reversed the policy of the Cain and Kirner governments. But by then, as Senator Brownhill would have guessed, the market had moved on, it had found other suppliers. The world economy changes and markets become soft. It will take some time to convince buyers that, based on our past performance, Victoria can be a reliable supplier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that APM has been woodchipping for about 50 years to supply feed stocks to its Maryvale pulp and paper mill. It is interesting that the timber industry inquiry, chaired by Professor Ian Ferguson, found that the regeneration of forest from which pulp wood was taken was superior to that from forest where it was left. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in Victoria can recall the Victorian Labor Government's attempt to look at the possibility of establishing a new greenfield pulp mill in East Gippsland. This plant would be worth in the order of $1.2 billion. A report found that both the Maryvale expansion and the new greenfield pulp mill could be supplied from existing sources. Indeed, major companies, including APM and APPM, were encouraged to prepare proposals at some cost to themselves. An office was established in Orbost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989-90 the process was halted by the Labor Party after these companies had spent substantial sums. In summary, this great proposal to develop a major new greenfield pulp and paper mill had fallen through because of factional difficulties in the ALP. While the Labor Party dithered on the proposal for a new greenfield plant in East Gippsland, five or six new plants were built elsewhere in the world, including two in Alberta, Canada. Market position and the opportunities to create Australian jobs had been lost, and we continue to import more wood and wood products from other countries in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to report that the amendments proposed by the Opposition are fully supported by the Victorian Association of Forest Industries. The Director of that association, Mr Norman Houn, put out a press release to that effect yesterday. Australian paper manufacturers have written to Mr Alan Griffiths urging him to accept the Opposition amendments. In a letter, APM announced last month that some $154m would be spent over the next four years to increase the capacity of its Maryvale plant. But had the Victorian Government shown the enthusiasm it now shows for enabling the expansion of Maryvale in the 1980s&mdash;in other words, it has done an about-turn again&mdash;we may well have had this major expansion up and running, creating import placement worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year. The Managing Director of APM, Mr McFarlane, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This expenditure to improve our position in import replacement for the domestic market is dependent on resource security at the State and Federal level. We therefore request you to find a `bankable solution' to the dilemma to resource security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our Maryvale operation is solely dependent upon residues from integrated sawlog operations in the Central Highlands of Victoria and we believe regional security is essential.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr McFarlane concluded this letter by supporting the amendments which are now before this chamber. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would urge you to consider appropriate amendments as suggested by NAFI.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was pleasing to note some foreshadowing of regional security in the economic statement in the CALM/AHC proposals.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us not forget that even if there is agreement by all parties for the northern Tasmanian pulp mill to go ahead, it will take anything up to two years for the environmental assessments that this Government demands to be prepared. But there may be a happy end to all this; by that time, a new government will be in office, and we will make sure the mill goes ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people standing in the way of these amendments are Mr Richardson and Mrs Kelly who are prepared to push an extreme Green line at the expense of jobs. We know that Alan Griffiths supports the thrust of these amendments. We have only to read his information paper on resource security, which he released on 19 February last year. What we do not know is whether Alan Griffiths has the courage and political clout to ensure that the legislation to encourage jobs will be passed in this chamber and to ensure that the intransigent position that elements in the Government are adopting do not destroy jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to say that public attitudes towards the industry versus the environment issue are changing. The survey carried out by Brian Sweeny and Associates, which was sent to the Prime Minister just the other day, showed a remarkable shift in attitudes by voters on the vexing question of industry activity-resource versus the environment. A great majority&mdash;over 60 per cent&mdash;have now come to the balanced view that both can coexist equitably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to honourable senators that this Bill seeks to ensure just what the public are now saying that they strongly support. We support the amendments which are proposed by NAFI. As I pointed out earlier in my remarks, a very comprehensive unity ticket supports these amendments, including Senator Sherry's mates in the union movement, and I will be interested to hear what Senator Sherry has to say. I urge the Senate to ensure that the amendments to the legislation are passed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this country, $1 in every $10 of our overseas debt is in forestry and forestry-related products. We continue to be one of the largest exporters of woodchips in the world and we continue to be one of the most significant importers of processed pulp and paper in the world. That, simply put, is economic lunacy. In terms of value added, the value of woodchips is approximately $80 a tonne; the value of paper is $800 a tonne; and if we go that one step further in the forest industries, the value of timber in the building and furniture industry can be up to $8,000 a tonne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have chosen to speak in this debate on the Forest Conservation and Development Bill because I am a member of the Caucus resource security committee and also, as I am a senator representing the State of Tasmania where forest issues, particularly over the last 15 years, have been a very major source of public debate. Forest industries in Tasmania are a very significant contributor to the Tasmanian economy. To those honourable senators who are not aware of this, Tasmania has approximately 50 per cent of Australia's eucalypt hardwood available for processing into sawlogs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this debate I intend to cover a number of topics. Firstly, I intend to give a brief overview of the legislation that we are considering. Secondly, I intend to relate that to the Tasmanian State resource security legislation. I then intend to make some comments about the approach of the Democrats-Greens to the issue of the forest industries, particularly resource security legislation. I then intend to make some comments about the attitude of the Federal Liberal Party. I will then be making some comments about a current industrial dispute in Tasmania with APPM, the proponents of a pulp mill in northern Tasmania, before making some concluding remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is entitled the Forest Conservation and Development Bill, but is more commonly known as resource security legislation. As a member of the Labor Party Caucus resource security committee, I was involved in a consultation process in the drafting of this legislation. I note with interest that the speaker's list on this legislation is growing daily; we now have some 25 persons speaking, nine of them from Tasmania. I certainly do not believe that is any coincidence, given the controversy of forestry issues in that State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation that is before us has one dominant purpose and that is to ensure new investment of at least $100m to produce goods for export and/or import replacement. The legislation is not designed to protect the industrial status quo by providing security to any use of wood for any purpose from any region. It is designed to shift the industry towards export-oriented, value adding activities and to facilitate large projects of that kind. World-scale pulp mills are, of course, the paradigm case, and we want to see such developments at the earliest opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order for this legislation to be met, there is a set of integrated activities. This does not mean that we should countenance a mere collection of sawmills as being eligible for resource security. I will return to that issue later when I deal with the objections of the Opposition. In the legislation we have also recognised that significant large scale investments of the type we are endeavouring to encourage can and do arise when companies expand or extend their existing facilities, perhaps through modernising or upgrading their plants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is determined to focus on investments of this size, that is, over $100m, in the context of this legislation because what the Government is offering to industry is not being done lightly. The Government is saying to industry, `We, as the Government of Australia, after conducting a comprehensive integrated assessment and satisfying ourselves that certain obligations have been entered into by the enterprise and the State Government, will tie ourselves by legislation not to use our statutory powers, except in exceptional circumstances'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will also encourage a significant increase in the area of commercial plantations in Australia. It provides for an up-front assessment. The real antecedents of this legislation can be found in the forest industry's feelings of uncertainty. That uncertainty has been engendered by fear of the Commonwealth using its powers to remove significant tracts of forest from productive investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the legislation, and part of the process, a thorough and comprehensive integrated assessment of any proposed project is required. The legislation carefully spells out the nature of that assessment. I do not intend in this speech to go into the detailed nature of that assessment, except to comment that it is a very comprehensive assessment that will cover all the values likely to be affected&mdash;environmental, cultural, heritage, social and economic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Heritage Commission must have a reasonable opportunity to consider and comment on matters that are within its ambit. The processes under the Commonwealth's Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act have also to be complied with. This legislation does not water down the Government's environmental policies or its legislation. On the contrary, it ensures that environmental issues are taken into account, as they should be, up front, not after the process has begun. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agreements between the Commonwealth, the State and the enterprise will be entered into. When the Commonwealth issues a declaration that a project has resource security, it will do so on the basis of formal written agreements between it and the State in which the project is to be conducted and between the State and the enterprise. These agreements will be public and they will be legally binding. These agreements, together with the integrated up-front assessment, are the foundation of resource security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are five potential circumstances set out in the Bill under which Ministers might need to reactivate their dormant powers. Again, I do not intend to go into detail about the five areas in which those dormant powers can be activated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to examine this Federal legislation in the context of the recent legislation that was passed in Tasmania. Before I do that, I point out that the Federal legislation has the capacity to pave the way for a pulp mill in northern Tasmania, for the existing mill in Maryvale in Victoria to be upgraded and, over the next decade, for significant major projects in Western Australia and east Gippsland in Victoria. The legislation encourages strong development in a sectoral way by setting the parameters for investment in a particular section&mdash;a very important section of our economy&mdash;by encouraging export-oriented growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Tasmania last year a Bill called the Forest Reform Bill was passed; it is more commonly known in that State as resource security legislation. This legislation followed a two-year examination of every conceivable aspect of the forest industry in Tasmania, certainly the most comprehensive examination of the way in which the forest industry in Tasmania is conducted and probably the most comprehensive examination of a forest industry anywhere in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to bear in mind that the aim of this State legislation was to create an integrated approach to economic and environmental decision making, so that sustainable&mdash;I emphasise that word `sustainable', particularly for the Democrats' purposes&mdash;management of our multiple-use forests can be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was general agreement that changes to the present systems in Tasmania were needed if Tasmanians were to gain the maximum benefit from their forest, land, labour and investment resources. The legislation was ultimately passed last year after considerable political wheeling and dealing by the then Liberal Opposition, which attempted to enter into a marriage of convenience with the Greens to defeat that legislation&mdash;albeit for reasons different from those given by those who adopt a somewhat similar approach in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That Bill is the first part of changes in legislation that will include resource security as the method for defining how different forest lands should be managed in the State of Tasmania. It is necessary to improve security of employment and stimulate investment in our forest-based industries and to make the best use of a public asset in a way that would benefit all Tasmanians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very briefly, the process that was followed examined every conceivable aspect of the forest industries in Tasmania, including the traditional concessions system. In the past in Tasmania vast areas of the State have been concessioned off to companies like APPM and ANM and they had a monopoly hold over those lands. It also examined industrial relations practices in the forest industry. It set aside further lands for protection in the form of World Heritage areas, national parks and State reserve, so that 27 per cent of the land area of Tasmania is now made up of State reserves, World Heritage areas and national parks. I emphasise that figure&mdash;27 per cent of the land area of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That process also provided for multiple-use forests. Those multiple-use forests will take up approximately 15 per cent of Tasmania. Not all of that 15 per cent of Tasmania, which is categorised as multiple-use forests, will be logged. Significant areas of that 15 per cent of Tasmania will not be logged because, if there is to be minimal damage to the environment as part of this process of resource security in Tasmania, it must be carried out in a much more environmentally sensitive way through the preservation of significant tracts of forest around stream areas and on steep slopes, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also looked at the way in which forest practices in the forest industry could be improved. The more intensive management of forests would increase productivity by the more efficient use of technology, scientific research and development, and by downstreaming or value adding. Again, this Federal Government's commitment is clearly illustrated by the developments that have taken place in the last eight years in the Furniture Research and Design Centre in Tasmania. I recommend that members of the Senate visit the Furniture Research and Design Centre in Hobart which produces magnificent furniture, again value adding for export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, the Tasmanian legislation provided for a new system of sawmilling licences. This issue is particularly important in the context of the demand being made by those opposite to reduce this $100m threshold, but I will return to that a little later.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a comprehensive attempt to develop a forest industry based on a broad consensus with the unions, the larger companies, the small sawmilling operators, the private landholders and the environment movement. All of the major players in Tasmania were involved in the consultative process but, at the last minute, the environment movement decided not to support the process, although it participated in that process over a period of some two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The environment movement clearly showed by that approach that it was not prepared to compromise.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a significant strain in the environment movement in Tasmania that holds to the principle that there should be no logging of native forests whatsoever. I will return to the principle that they espouse a little later when I deal with the Democrats-Greens and some of the arguments that they advance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have in Tasmania a thorough, comprehensive forest industry package that has been passed through State Parliament and has been legislated on. Connecting with that is the very important next step of the Federal legislation that is before the Senate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I would like now to turn to some of the objections that have been raised by what I term the Democrats-Greens in this place and in public debate on this issue over the last few years. The Democrats-Greens adopt a number of themes. Their first proposition is that there are declining jobs in the forest industry and that, therefore, we should not support this industry any more; we should not have it. I agree with their first factual analysis that the employment opportunities in this industry are declining, except in the furniture sector where there is a real increase in job numbers. But I do not agree with their conclusion that we do not have an industry. If we followed the Green economic lunacy&mdash;and that is what it is, economic lunacy&mdash;then we could come to the conclusion that because jobs are declining in almost every manufacturing industry in this country, on their logic we do not have manufacturing industry, which is absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Greens-Democrats also advance another theme that we should say no to world scale pulp mills and instead go for the smaller, presumably more environmentally friendly, pulp mills. There is just one snag with that argument, and that is that no-one wants to build small pulp mills. The trend around the world is towards large world scale pulp mills that are technology rich and are not big employers of labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Greens also advance the argument that there should be no logging of old growth forests. The consequence of that argument is, in Tasmanian terms&mdash;and I speak of Tasmania because of my own knowledge of this industry in Australia and in that State&mdash;that no logging of old growth forests and a switch to plantations would be catastrophic. I<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>t would mean that the logging of most of the forests in Tasmania would cease. Whilst some persons within their own moral code, within their own ethos, might believe that that is a good thing, I put it to the Senate that 27 per cent of the land area of Tasmania cannot be logged, and that really represents a very adequate proportion of the State and a very adequate representation of the biodiversity that is contained within the State of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To advocate no logging of areas outside those areas that have been preserved and reserved is quite a disastrous policy.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also ignores the fact that logging is an integrated activity. In Tasmania, when logging the old growth forests&mdash;hopefully, primarily, for sawlog&mdash;the inevitable fact is that there is quite a significant amount of waste because logs are round. The Democrats-Greens might have a problem with accepting the fact that logs are round. If one goes into a forest and recovers 30 per cent of that forest for sawlogging, at least 70 per cent of what is left is waste. On the logic of the Greens-Democrats that waste would lie on the ground and they would just burn it or leave it there to rot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This would be absolutely ridiculous for two reasons: first, it is a waste of a valuable economic resource that can hopefully be converted into pulp and paper; and, second, if they leave that resource&mdash;the waste&mdash;on the ground, then that waste will ensure, if it is left where it is, that the regrowth forest is an absolute shambles and mess. The waste has to be cleared away. The approach in Tasmania is to maximise from logging the high value-adding yields and the sawlog activity, and what is left is chipped for pulp and paper and, hopefully, processed in this country and not exported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Greens-Democrats advance another argument, and that is that this logging activity in Tasmania is terrible because it discourages tourism. The tourism industry in Tasmania has gone through unprecedented growth over the last 20 years, even with significant logging activity. I put it to the Senate and to the Greens-Democrats that we can successfully have both activities. We can have the development of a comprehensive, sensitive, tourism industry and we can have the development of a comprehensive and environmentally sensitive forest industry, including the use of old growth forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The reality of the approach of the Greens-Democrats was well summed up by a journalist last week. In fact, the Democrats were a bit sensitive about the description, but I am going to use it today&mdash;it is the moonbeam approach. That is the best way to describe the approach of the Democrats and the Greens. Little light and no substance&mdash;the moonbeam approach. If we are to stop logging and we are to stop integrated forestry in this country, that is a recipe for mounting debt, it is a recipe for not adding value to our raw resources and it is a recipe for increasing unemployment. I have to concede that when I talk to some of the Greens and Democrats about this issue some of them do put the view that we should not have economic growth, and some of them truly believe in that approach. I suppose, logically, if they believe that, then they are quite happy to put up with a situation of declining value adding and increasing unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But significant sections of the Greens and the Democrats are not honest about that approach and they are not willing to admit that their approach will mean an end to forestry in this country; it will mean increasing unemployment and it will mean declining value adding. Because of our increasing debt, of which 10 per cent is in forest and forestry products, it will mean that all the things the Democrats want to do&mdash;and presumably fund through a much expanded public sector&mdash;will not be possible, because if we cannot have sustained economic growth, how can we have growth in the public sector and all the sorts of things that they advocate, many of which I share?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I would now like to turn to the approach of the Opposition. I suppose it is much less honest than the Democrats-Greens, because at least the Democrats-Greens have been consistent. Even though I do not agree with much of their philosophy, it certainly has always been clearly and consistently put. They oppose this legislation in principle. Whilst I do not agree with the theories they are advancing, certainly I can respect their view. Those opposite have raised a plethora of arguments and amendments so as not to support this legislation. Dr Hewson, unfortunately, charged into this debate with little knowledge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As usual, that is right. The Opposition is caught with a consumption tax it does not want; and it is now caught with a fundamentally flawed approach to resource security. Dr Hewson got conned by his shadow Cabinet and, unfortunately, those opposite have been conned by Dr Hewson&mdash;particularly the Tasmanian Liberals, and I will say a little more about them later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Opposition has advanced a number of concerns about this legislation. I do not want to deal with the amendments one by one; I will just deal with the themes that have been raised. There are a number of amendments relating to the eligibility of State forest industry investment programs. The Government fully appreciates the important role which the sawmilling sector plays in the industry and its concern to have secure access to forest resources. The Commonwealth will provide a legislative level of resource security for the sawmilling sector. Indeed, in Tasmania, through the State resource security, we have considerable protection for small sawmillers. I will return to that later in the context of the Tasmanian Liberal senators' approach, because they know that this is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the legislation for the sawmilling sector, the Government intends to provide non-legislative resource security for investments which do not meet the $100m threshold. So the argument about the $100m threshold is a nonsense. Indeed, it is interesting and somewhat ironic that those opposite are suggesting that the Federal Government should become involved in the assessment of every forest project and sawmilling project in this country. The growth needed in the Federal bureaucracy to ensure a proper examination of every conceivable project in this country is a novel approach for the Opposition&mdash;indeed, a very new approach. I just wish it would consider the consequences if we remove the $100m threshold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that has been raised by those opposite in the context of this debate is compensation. I believe that if there had been some commonsense shown by the Opposition on this issue, that issue could have been dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn now to the conduct of my Liberal colleagues from Tasmania. Last week in the other place during a debate which was not very illuminating, an absurd series of propositions were put forward by some honourable members. For example, Mr Miles, the honourable member for Braddon, stated two reasons for opposing this legislation. The first was that a company such as APPM does not have sufficient incentive through the depreciation schedules to provide for investment. All I can say about the comments of Mr Miles is that he obviously did not read the One Nation package in which we have put forward a series of new and comprehensive depreciation schedules, which have been welcomed by the industry. So he cannot use that argument. Indeed, Mr Miles's State Leader, Ray Groom, welcomed the improvements in depreciation schedules. So Mr Miles obviously does not listen to his own State Liberal Leader in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the media over the last week in Tasmania&mdash;and we saw it last night as well&mdash;the new Premier of Tasmania, Mr Groom, urged Tasmanian Liberal senators to support the legislation. We often hear Opposition senators from Tasmania say that they are here representing Tasmania; that they will fight for Tasmania. They are being advised by their State colleagues, and particularly the State Premier, Mr Ray Groom, to support this legislation. What are they doing?  They are ignoring their State Liberal colleagues and they are ignoring the principles by which they often come in here and espouse States rights. They are full of rhetoric, but their rhetoric does not match their action on this issue. For example, in early March this year, Mr Ray Groom said that he was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">sick of the politicking on the fate of this important legislation. I do not mind saying I want the coalition in Canberra to support the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, members of the coalition here are not listening to what Mr Ray Groom has to say. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think they were wrong in taking the stand they are taking. Obviously you need good arguments to reject that legislation if a pulp mill depends on it.</PARA>
<PARA>We then had some of the most ridiculous comments I have ever heard in politics from Mr Smith, the honourable member for Bass in the other place. He said that he could not support the legislation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . because it was being supported by the ALP's extreme Left and the dark Greens, a piece of legislation they had long sought.</PARA>
<PARA>Well, I have some information for Mr Smith. The Left within the labour movement generally has opposed this legislation, not supported it. If that is the best Mr Smith can do, the Opposition's position on this legislation really is a joke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So they are the sorts of arguments that we have had particularly from Tasmanian Opposition members of this place and the other chamber. The fact of life for those opposite is that Dr Hewson made a mistake. It is interesting to note that he will never admit he makes a mistake. His problem is that he cannot back down and admit that he is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I conclude, I want to make a comment about APPM's recent approach to industrial relations. Whilst I support resource security legislation&mdash;and I think I have worked fairly hard and vigorously to ensure at State and Federal levels that that legislation is supported and passed&mdash;I condemn the industrial relations approach of APPM. There was a debate on that issue in the Senate after Question Time today. I condemn APPM for unilaterally attempting to cancel many of the over-award conditions of its employees in Tasmania and consistently refusing to meet with the union movement and its work force in order to discuss and resolve that issue. It has unilaterally cancelled industrial agreements. That sort of behaviour&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has rightly been pointed out by earlier speakers, the concept of resource security legislation or, as it is curiously termed, the Forest Conservation and Development Bill, is anathema to the Green movement. In the context of this Bill, resource security is designed to provide guaranteed access to precious assets at low cost for the benefit of large corporations and to the detriment of the global eco-system and to those employed in the timber industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Tasmania, for example, the major reason for resource security legislation was to provide industry with short term legislative guarantees to enable the forest industry to maximise its profit. As many are aware, native forest woodchipping will become uneconomic in less than 15 years when the large number of eucalypt plantations around the world will reach maturity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neither the Government nor the Opposition is truly interested in building a viable and sustainable forest industry which would provide real security of employment and lifestyle for workers in the industry; where the profits derived from forest operations benefited the whole of the community, instead of being shipped offshore with our trees. Neither the Government nor the Opposition realises the full extent to which they are being played off by the timber industry interests in this current debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can scarcely blame business and industry. Why should they not test the limits and push to get all they can? If the Government or Opposition is prepared to give away a cash crop and put no pressure on the development of sustainable agricultural feed stocks and environmentally safe downstreaming, why should they not take advantage of that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As other senators are aware, the recent agreement between the Conservation and Land Management Department of Western Australia and the Australian Heritage Commission has been proposed as the model for providing non-legislative resource security. The agreement was poorly conceived and confirms the conservation movement's fears that State and Federal governments are still willing to lock in unsustainable logging regimes around Australia. This will lead to the conversion of almost all of Australia's remaining ecologically diverse native forests into immature regrowth, which is of questionable environmental value. I regret that neither this Government nor previous governments took the opportunity to shift all sectors of the timber industry to a sustainable and secure footing, but rather they perpetuated the short term, profit-driven approach to resource development. All governments for the past 20 years have been willing to facilitate the unsustainable mining of our old-growth forests as a cash export crop, primarily for the profit of Japanese paper mills. No government has seriously facilitated any move to downstream process the trees that are cut down, despite this being a condition of woodchip licences since 1970. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with the increasing power of the woodchipping sector as the driving force behind the industry, there has been a coincident loss in jobs within the industry. The Green movement could potentially be the greatest ally of the timber industry and its workers, since grown trees are the most environmentally friendly supply of packaging, furniture, writing and building materials. However, the Green movement cannot honestly support an industry while it actively supports the destruction of natural areas and the species they contain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many statements have been made in the debate to the effect that `the Greens do not want this Bill because they do not want development', and that the Government is aiming for Green preferences by being lenient in relation to the conditions that this particular resource security legislation imposes. Those sorts of statements are not correct. In fact, the Green movement has genuine concern about the way in which this Bill is presented because it does not meet the true needs of the workers or the industry in the provision of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have been heavily emotionally blackmailed by the threat that unless the timber industry is provided with all this free, old-growth native forest material, there will be no investment later on in downstreaming. There has been no investment for 20 years, so why should we believe that there will be now? Once our precious resources are gone, they are gone forever. Regrowth cannot compare with the thousands of years of native forests that we are sacrificing in the vain hope that industry will have the integrity to do something that it has been promising to do for 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 200 years since Europeans colonised this country over 45 per cent of forest land has been cleared. Native forests are precious, safe houses for a diverse range of ecosystems and they must be protected at all costs. It is ironic that in the months leading up to the Earth Summit in Brazil, where many world leaders are set to sign a biodiversity convention, the Federal Government has felt obliged to introduce this archaic legislation which harks back to the golden years of exploitation of this country's resources. It also seems incongruous, in a year when the Government is moving closer to finally introducing legislation to protect endangered species, that it has introduced a Bill which seeks to destroy the forest habitats of many of those endangered species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Resource security seems to be entirely a flag-flying exercise on the part of the Federal Government. It arose largely because the timber industry decided that it was time to flex its muscles and show its international bankers that it does have the political power to force government to respond to its wishes. However, it is unlikely that any of the promised pulp mills will ever be built in Australia. The world pulp and paper market will continue to be flooded by cheap woodchips and pulp from Third World nations. Australia has lost the race to build any pulp mills based on a native forest resource. As a consequence, the major aim of this legislation will not be fulfilled. In other words, no investment and no jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By persisting with this Bill the Government has chosen to ignore the findings of the Resource Assessment Commission's report on forestry industry, the work done during the ecologically sustainable development process, and the report of the National Plantation Advisory Committee. These reports all found that the forestry industry is currently unsustainable. The cost to our community of resource security over publicly owned forests will be the total obliteration of our old-growth and native forests&mdash;all done for the scant hope that some transnational companies might make an investment in Australia by building a highly automated, low-labour pulp mill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wilderness Society, the Australian Conservation Foundation and Greenpeace, among others, have clearly outlined the employment opportunities in ecologically sustainable industry, and in particular through a realignment of the timber industry to a plantation base, as well as jobs involving the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency. I would like to stress that the Greens would support the development of a niche market in quality recycled paper. We do support downstream processing and incentive being given for the development of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clean process pulp and paper mills for plantation or agriculturally based feed stocks would be much more acceptable because they would not be damaging to our environment and they would not be depriving us of our precious native old-growth forests. People may not be aware that using native old-growth forests absolutely necessitates the most damaging pulp mills. We would be prepared to look at non-kraft, non-chlorine processing mills. However, as I have already mentioned, the race has been lost.

Many senators were aware that her predecessor&mdash;who stood originally on a peace movement ticket and later for the Greens&mdash;was absent from the chamber on many occasions when important Bills came up for debate, although she maintained to the people of Western Australia that she was representing them in those matters. I congratulate Senator Chamarette on her maiden speech. She is a colleague of mine from that great State of Western Australia, with great forests and a great environment&mdash;no thanks to the Government of Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are here today not so much to discuss resource security or to discuss a Bill with a dubious title, but because of the crass political manipulation of the environment debate, specifically by this Labor Government, but to a certain extent by Labor governments throughout Australia&mdash;Labor governments that have burdened Australians for the past eight or nine years. We are here because the old ways of protecting the environment, the old ways of centralised control and government control of vast tracts of land, and centralised control through planning authorities and environment protection authorities, have not worked. They have not worked for a good many reasons, but the main reason is that, when we want to protect a resource or an environment, the last person we would want to give that responsibility to is a politician or bureaucrat, because the forces that go to work on politicians and bureaucrats are not necessarily the forces that best protect the environmental values that all of us hold dear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all put different emphasis on how we would seek to protect the environment, but I think at the heart of most of the people in this chamber there is a genuine commitment to protecting our environment and to rehabilitating some of the problems that have been created by bad management of the environment and our natural heritage in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been faced with this dilemma in Australia, particularly in the last eight years&mdash;although some of the decisions of previous governments were in the same vein, so it has not been limited to the last eight years. Whenever we come up with a problem&mdash;be it in the environment, industry or taxation policy&mdash;this Government does not face the important questions of public policy, the best interests of the nation and the best interests of the individuals within this nation. Instead, in its corporatist style, it approaches its mates in either the union movement, the environmental movement or even in big business and seeks to do a deal that acts in the interests of the politicians, the bureaucrats, the Australian Labor Party and the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last couple of years we witnessed the blatant political manipulation of the environment agenda by the former Minister for the Environment, Senator Richardson. We witnessed his crass manipulation of the preferences of the Greens and the Democrats in the last Federal election. Indeed, any analysis of the results of that election will show that Senator Richardson's manipulation of that vote and the issues was the reason that my colleagues and I are sitting on this side of the chamber and not on the other side. Of course, the important thing to understand is that the environment has not been better protected by the corporatist big government regulatory interventionist approach that has been pursued by this Labor Government and, indeed, by many governments of different political persuasions in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are discussing the concept of resource security. I put it to the Senate that we cannot have any proper resource security without property rights. Senator Chamarette supported that contention when she said that the real resource security we get is from privately owned plantations. I am suggesting to the Senate that until we have private ownership of forests&mdash;whether plantations or natural eucalypt forests&mdash;we will not have resource security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with this legislation is that it is a crass reaction to a problem caused by the Federal Labor Government. We never used to discuss resource security eight or nine years ago because there were proper State agreements in place and resource security was granted on a State by State, project by project, basis by the relevant authorities. It is only the crass manipulation of the politics of the environment that has seen resource security come under threat. All of a sudden we have this reaction in a fatally flawed piece of legislation to protect the resource required by the forestry based industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must look at the serious public policy goals of the environment and, of course, of protecting the forests and all of the values that lie within those forests. We need to look at the value of the wilderness, the value of maintaining a habitat and the very important value of natural forests as a sink for greenhouse gases. We also need to look at their value as a renewable resource for the timber industry. We need to look at their value for recreation purposes and we also need to look at their value as a buffer zone between the growing metropolises around Australia. We need some natural heritage to surround our concrete jungles and our ever sprawling metropolitan areas and metropolitan suburbs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It comes down to an issue of management. In Australia we have seen an enormous concentration on public sector management and public sector ownership of these forest resources. The alternative is to move totally to private sector management or ownership. I do not think the Australian people would cop all of the national parks and the forests being owned by the private sector. The obvious solution is to have a balanced mix. That is what is missing at the moment; there is no balanced mix between public ownership and private ownership. I want to put to the Senate a more radical solution to this problem, probably outside the ambit of this Bill, but clearly a matter that is raised by the important issues of principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer briefly to one of the fundamental weaknesses of this Bill. It relates to a matter that Senator Sherry referred to earlier concerning the $100m cut-off and the fact that this legislation is designed to encourage the development of big&mdash;as Senator Sherry said&mdash;internationally competitive pulp mills. The real fact of this legislation is that in specifying projects of over $100m and providing only those projects with so-called resource security, we are actually picking industrial winners. The Government has made the decision that Australia's future in forest and timber products is related only to these massive $100m projects. It says that this is where all the employment will occur and this is where the future lies for Australia's forest industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the Senate that members of the Government are the last people who should be able to decide where the winners are going to be in forest industries. I am sure most people around this chamber&mdash;and the Greens and the Democrats&mdash;would agree with me when I say that it is probably better for Australia's future if the Government gets out of picking winners and ensures that we have some genuine resource security for all industries related to forest and timber products. Indeed, why pick on $100m projects when we could just allow the market to decide on whether we have one $100m project or ten $1m projects?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality in the forest industries at the moment&mdash;I know this from my own personal experience in the south-west of Western Australia&mdash;is that the people who use the forest resource most effectively, the people who get the real value out of each log and who extract the most timber from each log, are the very small operators who provide niche markets. Why can we not have a forest industry that has hundreds of little forest operators in the forests all around Australia, some based on plantations, some based on original natural forests, supplying niche markets and coming up with systems and new techniques to extract the maximum value from the forest resource? One of the reasons why that does not happen is because the forest resource is, by and large, owned by the public sector. It does not price the value of either the logs, the forests, the other timber products or the other important values from forests&mdash;that is, recreational uses and habitat value and so forth&mdash;because the State Government sets the value of the forest resource. I put it to the Senate that we are not ending up with the proper, effective or efficient economic use of our forest resource. That is one of the reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other fatal flaws of the argument of the Democrats and the Greens is this idea of closing down all native forests and ensuring that all of our future forest products are provided by plantations. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, we should let them all die of old age, like old politicians. One of the problems is that if we do not have a properly based economic set of incentives because the value of State-owned native forest is underpriced by public ownership, there is no incentive to develop proper plantations. If the value of the timber is underpriced, the value of plantation timber is underpriced so we do not have a proper incentive to plant plantations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem with basing our industry on plantations is that we destroy one of the important aspects that the Greens talk about&mdash;that is, biodiversity. That is a complicated word which I do not really understand but which I thought I would slip in. More seriously, biodiversity is the intricate ecosystem that operates within forests. If we have plantations of softwood or hardwood all over the place and we do not have a balanced ecosystem which takes place within a native forest, we cannot achieve our aim of ensuring that biodiversity is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a real alternative. It is, of course, increasing private ownership of native eucalypt forests. It is a concept which was very ably put on the Australian political agenda by the Tasman Institute last year in its submission to the Resource Assessment Commission inquiry into the use of forests in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of examples around the world where private ownership of native forests has achieved all the aims of the environmental movement as well as the aims of the private sector, which seeks to derive profit and create jobs from native forests. I think Australia and this Government should look at the private management of national parks&mdash;indeed, the Opposition will look at this. At the moment, national parks are managed by rangers and the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. In many cases the national parks are very badly managed. I put it to the Senate that the management of many national parks and State forests around Australia could be contracted out to the private sector. Many of the objectives we have sought would be achieved more cost effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the approach of the Federal Labor Government, and of many governments in the past, to environment policy is to convert the public concern about the environment into a catalyst or a Trojan horse to centralise more power and control over all aspects of the environment into the hands of government. Putting power and control into the hands of a few politicians and bureaucrats has dangerous consequences for the economy, for individual liberty and, very importantly, for the future of our natural environment. It is simply not possible for a centralised group of so-called experts to manage and control the extraordinarily diverse resources, decision-making processes and events that are crucial to the environment. Yet this Government is trying to do just hat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will cite a few brief examples from around the world of where private management and ownership of forests have been quite successful. Forests and other wilderness areas have a large range of uses and values. The current debate concentrates only on the value of the timber resource. I suggest that control of the land by a government controlled agency is perhaps the last way a rational person would seek to maximise or even place value on many of these other amenities that a forest can have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is, but it is made simplistic so that even Senator Bolkus can understand it. If we analyse what we have in our forests&mdash;with their innate beauty, their value as a natural resource of timber and paper, their wilderness value as a store for genetic diversity, as a wildlife habitat and for recreational uses, with their global value as a sponge for greenhouse gases&mdash;we must ask the following question. Could they not be better protected, enhanced and expanded by being privately managed and, in some cases, privately owned? As I have said, the indisputable fact is that private management of timber, recreation uses and so forth has been proved right around the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Independent assessments of government management of forests in both the United States and Australia have resulted in the conclusion that the resources are underpriced and, therefore, that too much logging takes place. I refer to two recent examples from the United States. I quote from the Tasman Institute report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The International Paper Company's wildlife program in the south of the United States is a prime example of how a firm can benefit from using forest resources to non-wood services. The International Paper Company employs specialists to oversee wildlife and recreation on its lands, including some 16 000 acres in the Southlands Experiment Forest located near Bainbridge, Georgia. There, research is carried out to develop forest management practices that enhance wildlife population as well as profits. White-tailed deer, turkeys, rabbits, bobwhite quail, mourning doves and other species are beginning to reap the benefits of new management techniques. Habitat is improved by controlling burning, buffer zones along streams and tree cutting practices that leave wild cover and plenty of forage.</PARA>
<PARA>The report also cites another very good American example. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A non profit organisation formed by 20 landowners, North Maine Woods Inc., manages recreation on 2.8 million acres. . .</PARA>
<PARA>To put that into an Australia context, it is an area approximately half the size of Tasmania or, even closer to home, 10 times the size of the Australian Capital Territory. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The organisation was initiated by the land owners when they began to experience problems from recreational use. These problems included soil erosion and safety on private roads, overcrowding and overuse of camping areas, littering and the ever-present problem of forest fires.</PARA>
<PARA>These are things which are all quite relevant to Australian forests. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">North Maine Woods Inc. controls access to the area through 17 checkpoints and access roads, where visitors were required to register, pay fees for different types of use, and obtain permits for campsites. In 1984, the fees ranged from $2 per day to $17 for an all season permit and were used by the association to construct and improve campsites, run a rubbish collection system and run public education programmes on use of the woods. Though the initial efforts were restricted by those who were accustomed to free, unrestricted access, the less crowded, clean, well organised system of recreation management is promoting cooperation between landowners and recreationalists.</PARA>
<PARA>There is another quite beautiful example of the use of free market forces in trying to protect very valuable forest resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the Amazon Basin. This was referred to in an issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fortune</EMPHASIS> magazine last year in an article entitled `Using Market Forces to Save Nature'. The article describes the efforts of Mr Jason Clay from a group called Cultural Survival Enterprises, based in Massachusetts. It was designed to help natives in the Amazon Basin form into cooperatives to harvest and sell rainforest products. The aim is to make the forest more valuable alive than dead. It shows every sign of success with orders worth millions of dollars for products such as the rainforest crunch peanut brittle, resins, oil pigments and brazil nuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think all of these examples, including the example as close to home as Dr Walmsley's project in South Australia, show that there is a real alternative to government ownership and control of forest resources. The alternative to the very centralised process we have at the moment is to encourage private ownership, to move towards&mdash;on a trial basis&mdash;the privatisation of natural eucalypt forests and the contracting out of management of national parks. We need to have property rights; the resource should be owned by the people who want to use them. Groups such as the Australian Conservation Foundation could, instead of chopping down trees and spending millions of dollars on propaganda to push its preservationist anti-development views, actually spend that money buying tracts of natural forest and managing them for the conservation of the values that I have referred to previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by quoting Professor Richard B. Stewart, a Harvard law professor, who said in 1988:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our current environment regulatory system was an understandable response to a perceived need for immediate controls to prevent a pollution crisis. But the system has gone to the point where it amounts to nothing less than a massive effort at Soviet-style </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">central planning of the economy to achieve environmental goals. It strangles investment and innovation. It encourages costly and divisive litigation and delay. It unduly limits private initiative and choice. The centralised command system is simply unacceptable as a long term environmental protection strategy for a large and diverse nation committed to the market and decentralised ordering.</PARA>
<PARA>I put it to the Senate that this legislation is a classic example of a government imposing a centralised, bureaucratic system to solve a problem that really should be handed back in the States, back in the local communities, back in the forests, forest by forest, project by project. The amendments that the Opposition has moved in the Senate today make what is a terrible piece of legislation, a disastrous piece of legislation, into something slightly more acceptable.

There was a time, cute as it might have been, when the written word of a Prime Minister meant something. I take it that it meant something to Arvi Parbo, because BHP Gold Mines invested something in the order of $15m&mdash;a sheer bagatelle to this Government&mdash;of shareholders' money to explore, investigate, and examine the resource potential of the Coronation Hill area.

Her job was to keep its vote. It was not a question of what was right and what was wrong; she was simply to keep that vote marshalled. She wanted a memorandum of understanding and Mr Alan Griffiths wanted legislation. Why the dichotomy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legislation requires an amendment to be passed through both Houses of the Parliament. A memorandum of understanding, simply at the whim of the Minister, can be changed, altered or broken. What Mrs Ros Kelly wanted was a continuing right to change the rules.

It is interesting that Mr Hawke said that legislation did not need to be in place for a process to be followed whereby a State government which had come to an arrangement with respect to a proposal to establish a pulp mill could come to the Federal Government in respect of its requirements. He was quite right. Legislation is not needed, except with this Government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the dinner recess I said that it was not without significance to note the difference in the approach to this legislation between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly). On the one hand two of them saw the intrinsic merit in the legislation because they understood that businesses, companies and corporations would not continue to invest in Tasmania until black and white legislation was in place. Mrs Ros Kelly is carrying a brief for the conservation movement, and I do not mean `conservation movement' in the general sense of the word. I am referring to the extreme radical group which is anti-development and not pro-conservation. Members of that group did not want the legislation because they understand that legislation requires amendment by both Houses of the Parliament. However, a notional proclamation from a Minister without legislation is a much easier way of doing business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might well ask why it is that this legislation is necessary for the forest industry but it is not necessary for other industries. I ask: why is it not necessary for any other resource industry? I take it that the reason is that this debate has really reached the pinnacle of extremities, if honourable senators will forgive my indulgence in language. It is because the most extreme and hypocritical people are the ones who raise their angry voices&mdash;for reasons known only to themselves and not others&mdash;when it comes to dealing with forest resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not matter if other parts of the environment are despoiled and whether uranium, beach sands, coal, phosphate or iron ore are being mined.

Industry does not want to ignore the environment or put it aside. It wants clear, unequivocal, rigid, solid, fixed guidelines as to what is expected of it in terms of the environment. However, that is something that clearly this Government has been unable to provide thus far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by unequivocally supporting the amendments. To the extent that legislation is necessary to bolster and buttress the integrity of this Government, I support the amendments moved by the Opposition and I particularly commend the integrity and fortitude of my colleagues from Tasmania and the contributions made by them. I ask: why is there a $100m criterion in respect to the trigger mechanism for this legislation? It is almost as if this Government&mdash;like every other spectrum of its political judgment&mdash;believes that big is beautiful. I understand one major sawmill operator exports something like $5m per year in non-value-added sawn timber products. The industry ought not be responsible merely for import replacement, but should create export earnings and a significant part of the industry will be denied that. While I do not suggest for a moment that exported value-added products contribute in any way to the non-value added exports, in terms of volume they have the capacity to be worth 10 times the amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet we again find how this Government&mdash;always a government of compromise, always a government of shoddy deals, always a government trying to find consensus where there is none&mdash;has found itself with legislation which it desperately hoped would satisfy both the extremes in its own political party and its supporters, while at the same time seeking to satisfy and reassure business in this country. Of course it has dismally failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding is that the overwhelming majority of the industry is totally and absolutely opposed to this legislation in its present form. The sadness for me is that it is a repetition of that which we have seen so often in other projects around Australia. Without going through a long list, I look at the projects in Western Australia which have been held up on environmentally related grounds. The problem is not with satisfying environmental demands but simply with finding out what those environmental demands are. This is true of mineral sands, uranium, gold, nickel and the whole spectrum of resource development in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many respects this legislation is a watershed. It is necessary because the Government is not to be trusted.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, I draw your attention to the fact that the industry body wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 16 October last year asking then for this legislation to be withdrawn. Since then, the industry and the Opposition have proposed amendments over and over again, without success. Even APPM has acknowledged that it is flawed legislation, but it pushes for the passing of the Bill on the basis that it could be fixed up afterwards.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That is not necessarily so and it is certainly no justification for passing faulty legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind you, Mr Deputy President, that we have seen other industries come a cropper on unacceptable legislation. We only have to remember the wool industry's recent pleadings for changes to its legislation, and what sort of a mess that industry would have been in if it had got the legislation it was prepared to accept in the first place. It makes one realise that people who grasp at straws are likely to find that the straws are useless as crutches. Even APPM's head company, North Broken Hill Peko Pty Ltd, was a signatory to a letter to the Prime Minister just last month urging a widening of the eligibility of the legislation to include a regional approach. So this legislation should not pass in this form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Association of Forest Industries has long pressed the Government to amend the Bill, without success. It is not alone. The major industries and the industry bodies share its concern. I will put on record what some of them have been saying about this legislation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">NAFI has said:</PARA>

<PARA>The Pulp and Paper Manufacturers Federation of Australia, which is the peak body for the pulp and paper manufacturers, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It might appear strange that the organisation which represents the major pulp and paper companies supports amendments for regional resource security supporting smaller sawmill investment, however, there is both a principle and a practicality at stake here . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principle is that providing adequate conservation is delivered by the legislation, and this is one of its major purposes, then all investments in value added industry whether it be for sawmills or pulpmills should be encouraged by resource security . . . Lack of such security is already causing industry to invest in countries other than Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The practicality involved here is that many large investments could and should be taken by the pulp and paper industry which involve investments less than the $100 million which is the cut-off in the proposed legislation. These investments will also be in jeopardy if the amendments to the Bill are not passed.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Paper Manufacturers says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government could accept these amendments without a major change to the intention of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have asked Minister Griffiths to seek consultation with the Opposition so that effective amendments are considered.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a pretty long litany of requests for amendments from the industry throughout Australia, including Tasmania. The Government must either withdraw this legislation and replace it with a satisfactory Bill, or it should accept the amendments which the Opposition and the industry require. We propose to send this Bill to a legislative standing committee if the amendments are not passed in this chamber to give witnesses the opportunity to explain the deficiencies in the legislation. Perhaps then the Government will see sense. If it is not prepared to act in the interests of the entire forest industry, I will vote against this Bill, not because my Party requires it but because it is the only measure left to me to take in all conscience. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support wholeheartedly the coalition's position for one very simple reason: in Queensland we have paid the price of environmentalism gone mad. In Queensland, we have the wreck of a timber industry. This once great industry has been decimated by environmentalists locking up more and more and more of the forest, providing no security for investment, providing no security for jobs, and providing no security for industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we have, as we have at the moment, $1.8 billion of timber coming from overseas into this country every year, it is absolutely crucial for the future of our economy that we are able to turn that around. We need to be able to generate positive investment in the timber industry so that there will be jobs in the future and so that we will be able to avoid this continuing syndrome of import decline. It is therefore important that resource security legislation provide not just for the large pulp millers, but also for the small sawmillers. Unless we have that, the heart of our timber industry will be taken away. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to take this final opportunity on behalf of the Brisbane-Lockyer Valley Branch of the Forest Protection Society to make an appeal for your support concerning the amendment to the proposed Forest Resource Security Legislation, which is being debated in the Senate today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our Branch covers the entire Brisbane Valley and Lockyer Valley and consists of many small towns which will cease to exist if the Resource Security is allowed to be passed without the proposed amendments, put forward by the Unions and the National Association of Forest Industries.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Joanne Werner</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secretary</PARA>
<PARA>That is but one of a number of facsimile messages I have received. I have received facsimile messages from the National Association of Forest Industries, Foxwood Ltd in Cairns, Logform in Kilcoy, Rankin Bros in Malanda, Bellthorpe Box and Timber Company in Woodford, Wade Sawmill in Maryborough, Rankin Timber and Trusses in Stratford, Davidson Sawmills, Ford Timbers in Springwood&mdash;an area where they have logged for 60 years&mdash;and so the list goes on. It is very clear that the small timber operators, the small sawmillers, the people who provide the bulk of the employment in the small towns of regional Australia, are opposed to this Bill being passed without the amendments that NAFI supports and that we in the coalition support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is passing strange that the Government should oppose amendments to this Bill which are supported by the unions. What this is all about is providing jobs&mdash;providing jobs where there would otherwise be no jobs. In support of this proposition, I draw the Senate's attention to the impact assessment of the World Heritage listing which was conducted by the survey research and consultancy unit of the Department of Anthropology and Sociology at the University of Queensland. It looked into what happened when the timber industry was closed down in north Queensland; and it looked into what happened when the World Heritage listing went through. Its finding was very, very clear. Over 645 jobs were lost directly as a result of that World Heritage listing&mdash;645 jobs in areas where these people have no other source of employment, where they will have no alternative but to be condemned to a long term future on the dole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get one thing clear: these are not people who take life easy. These are the hard workers in our society. Timber workers are some of the hardest working people in this country. For them, the shame of unemployment is a stigma almost too difficult to bear. I do not believe that I can, in good conscience, as a representative of Queensland, as a representative of people in regional Queensland, come into this Senate and vote for this legislation unless these amendments are passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spent a portion of last week in the Brisbane Valley. I spoke to the sawmillers. I visited a sawmill which employs 18 people and which has an investment of half a million dollars. That may not sound like much on the scale of $100m but it is important to that town. It is important to the families of the 18 people who work there. It is important to the transport operators, and it is important to the region. In spite of the fact that the sawmill is small, in spite of the fact that its capital investment is only half a million dollars, it is very profitable because it operates in a niche market, producing mouldings and specialised cuts of timber&mdash;hardwood and softwood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is this: if we do not have the resource security for those small sawmillers as well as the big operators, we run the very real risk that our softwood plantations, in which this nation has invested hundreds of millions of dollars, will never be harvested anyway because there will not be the mills to process the timber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is just not satisfactory that the timber industry be put in the hands of only a couple of big companies. That is not what micro-economic reform or economic efficiency is about. Nor is it what a competitive and efficient economy is about. As far as I am concerned, a competitive and efficient economy is about giving every single operator a fair go.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased, briefly, to join my colleagues in proposing amendments to improve and make sensible the Forest Conservation and Development Bill. We in the Liberal and National parties have proposed 17 amendments, drawn with the full support of the forestry industry and the unions, which make the following improvements to the legislation. They would extend the eligibility for resource security to projects accredited under State forestry plans; remove the $100m limit on resource security; ensure that consideration is given to the provision of alternative resources where the resource security is lost because of unforeseen circumstances; and remove the clauses exempting the Commonwealth from paying compensation where resource security is lost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues have explained the Bill in very great detail and have put forward arguments which I only hope the Government will take notice of and will accept. I particularly congratulate Senator Tambling on the way he dealt with the Bill here, and Mr Lloyd and Mr Chaney who have done so much work on the Bill in the other place. I also congratulate my colleagues in the Senate from Tasmania who have spoken on this Bill so forcefully. I again contrast their involvement in this Bill with the involvement of honourable Labor senators from Tasmania. I understand that only Senator Sherry is listed to speak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not often agree with Senator Sherry, but I agree with him when he refers to the Australian Democrats as moonbeams. That seems to be particularly apt in describing the Democrats' attitude to this Bill&mdash;moonbeams with little light and little substance. Of course, the Democrats' attitude to this sort of legislation and similar legislation is so ridiculous that it really should not involve anyone spending too much time on the way they approach these sorts of things, except to concur with Senator Sherry in that one aspect of his speech on this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In common with all other senators, I have had a wide range of submissions made to me by various people involved in this industry, encouraging parliamentarians from all sides to support the amendments that have been proposed by the Opposition. I want to address some of the submissions in support of the amendments that have come from the north Queensland area which I principally represent in this Parliament. I refer to submissions I have received from Rankine Bros Pty Ltd, which operates out of Malanda, Stratford, Kairi, Cairns, Yungaburra, Mossman, Kuranda and Cooktown. I have also received submissions from Rankine Timber and Trusses which operates from Stratford in Cairns, from Foxwood Ltd which operates in Ingham, Innisfail and Cairns, and from Tully Sawmills, which obviously operates out of Tully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also had discussions with the operators of the Ravenshoe timber mill. That timber mill has had a sorry history in recent times due directly to the inefficiency and the stupidity of the decisions made by this Government some years ago, which caused such untold misery and hardship to people in communities in Ravenshoe and in other areas on the Atherton Tablelands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These companies are all very concerned about the future of what is left of the timber industry in north Queensland. There is only very little of that industry left following this Government's stupidity in the way that it dealt with the World Heritage listing of the rainforests. The World Heritage listing locked up some 900,000 hectares of rainforest in north Queensland, all but decimating the local timber industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The few remaining companies use locally, privately owned rainforest and hardwood as well as pine plantations and some crown hardwoods. But they also rely very heavily on sawn timber from southern Queensland and northern New South Wales to supplement their operations in order to supply the north Queensland building industry. In the case of Rankine Bros, a small amount of timber is also imported from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If resource security is not granted to suppliers of their timber in south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales, then the north Queensland industry is under serious threat. Northern timber industry leaders are rightly annoyed that the Government is happy to provide resource security to a $100m operation in New South Wales or Tasmania, but that the small operators in north Queensland are left in the cold without any guarantee whatsoever. Investment in the timber industry is a huge risk unless some guarantees are provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989-90 we imported some $463m worth of sawn timber from overseas. Without resource security for timber suppliers in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales, there will need to be an increase in our sawn timber imports to supply the north Queensland area. Accordingly, the building industry in north Queensland will face higher charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time is at a premium in this debate, but I want briefly to mention some of the things that were said in the submissions that have been made to me. Rankine Timber and Trusses from Stratford said, in part, in its letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need sensible legislation that cares for ordinary people and their well-being not political solutions catering to the demands of multinationals or altruistic zealots.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to see my Queensland colleague from the ALP in the chamber, and just wish that he would take some notice of what was said. I have a copy of a letter which Tully Sawmills wrote to all Queensland Labor senators&mdash;Senator Burns, Senator Colston, Senator Jones and Senator Reynolds. In part, this letter said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I write on behalf of my family, my 25 employees and their families to express our disbelief and our disgust that your Government by way of this legislation proposes to grant resource security to pulp and paper mills but not to sawmills which are huge employers of labour and very important sectors of many communities.</PARA>
<PARA>Further in the letter they say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We stress that without resource security it is impossible for our industry to undertake investment or maintain and expand employment. In fact it would mean the eventual closure of hundreds of sawmills and the loss of tens of thousands of jobs. Should that occur, I would suggest that all those who are directly and indirectly dependent on our industry would never be able to forgive your Government or your party.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a copy of a letter that was sent to me, and I guess to other honourable senators in Queensland, but it was addressed to the Labor Party senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I inquire of Senator Burns, Senator Colston, Senator Jones and Senator Reynolds what they are going to do about it. Will Senator Jones take any notice of that at all? Does he intend to do something for these small business people involved in the timber industry in his State? Senator Jones is shaking his head. He is not going to do anything. Those honourable senators do not give a damn about them. They care about the big multinationals, about the people with $100m or more, but they just do not care about the little people. I doubt that Senator Jones gets up that way very often. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Out of north Queensland in the rest of Queensland, the Queensland Forest Protection Society said some things that I think should be recorded. In part, it said in its submission to me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't believe the towns and cities which rely on the jobs and revenue created by the 1400 sawmills across Australia are any less worthy of consideration than the big ticket investment item proposed to be given resource security under the existing legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The financial and social security of hundreds of towns will be destroyed if Resource Security legislation currently proposed by the Federal Government is not amended to incorporate accredited regional forest plans.</PARA>
<PARA>Further in the submission it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill before Parliament gives the Federal Government an ideal opportunity to finally resolve the forest debate through proper scientific processes and not the shonky deals which were the hallmarks of business and politics during the 1980's.</PARA>
<PARA>I add that the shonky deals were hallmarks of this Government as well. Further, the Caboolture branch of the Forest Protection Society said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will be watching with great interest and waiting while the politicians decide the future of 80,000 forest industry jobs and the many hundreds of communities who rely on this industry for their security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will also be remembering these same politicians when it is our turn to decide on someone's job and future&mdash;their's, at the next election.</PARA>
<PARA>I might raise that query with the Federal Labor members in north Queensland&mdash;Mr Lindsay, Mr Hulls and Mr Gayler&mdash;and ask them what they are going to do to protect the jobs of the timber mill workers in their area. In a submission made by another branch of the Forest Protection Society, it was said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Uniform resource security legislation developed on a regional basis is what the industry and the economy needs, not just one or two major capital projects.</PARA>
<PARA>The Woodford branch of the Forest Protection Society, already quoted by Senator O'Chee, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If these amendments are introduced and passed,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the amendments proposed by the Liberal and National parties&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">we believe it will not only provide job security for thousands of workers and the many communities they come from but also encourage companies to start reinvesting in the Forest Industries.</PARA>
<PARA>The Forest Protection Society in Wide Bay states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We should not be discriminated against simply because we do not have the magical investment figure as proposed by the current legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>The Brisbane Valley Lockyer branch of the Forest Protection Society said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our Branch covers the entire Brisbane Valley and Lockyer Valley and consists of many small towns which will cease to exist, if the Resource Security is allowed to be passed without the proposed amendments, put forward by the Unions and the National Association of Forest Industries.</PARA>
<PARA>Ford Timbers in a submission said, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the proposed legislation, which is being debated today in the Senate, limits the application of Resource Security to projects worth $100 million or more.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This eliminates virtually all of the smaller sawmillers throughout Australia and offers them no protection at all.</PARA>
<PARA>Later it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ford Timbers and its associated companies employ 120 people and have more than $13 million invested in sawmills at Woodenbong, Drake and Urbenville in northern New South Wales and a timber yard in Brisbane.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ford Timbers has been operating now for almost 60 years and we have contributed a lot to the local economy. We want to see our future, and the future of our employees, protected by legislation which has been properly thought out.</PARA>
<PARA>Further in that submission, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the proposed legislation in its current form would offer no long term security to the timber industry generally and had to be amended if industry security was to be guaranteed.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I quote from a little submission from a little mill, Davidson Sawmill at North Arm. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without this security we cannot possibly undertake this, maintain or expand employment or continue support of our community or have in place a fully sustainable industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991 is supported by some sections of the timber industry; it is not supported by others, who believe it should have gone further than it has in the direction of providing resource security. On balance, I think it is fair to claim that this legislation has the support of the industry, if only for the reason that the industry believes it is better to have this legislation than to have nothing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own view is that the system which has been adopted by the State Government of Western Australia under which specified, identified areas of land are reserved for timber production and other areas of land or forest are excluded from timber production&mdash;leaving aside whatever reservations one might have about the proportions of those two decisions about forest use&mdash;is a better strategy to adopt than the one adopted by this Bill. Under such a strategy, particular parts of Australia would be geographically identified and designated as areas either available or not available for timber production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Such an approach, of course, is stridently opposed by the Greenies because the Greenies are not interested in a compromise. The Green extremists want to close down the Australian timber industry. Nothing short of that objective will satisfy them. They are, therefore, completely opposed to any land or resource use legislation or measures which allow any identified part of the Australian continent to be used for economic purposes. They want to close down the lot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leads me to some of the fears I have about the specific clauses of this Bill. I will not read them at great length, but I refer to clause 16(3) and the consequential relevant references in 17(2), 17(5) and 17(6). These provide the opportunity, at least, for objection to be taken as to land which has been designated to be available for timber production, on the grounds that information not known at the time the designated Ministers made their decision has come to light and, therefore, the decision should be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe there is a real danger that those clauses will be exploited in a way that the Government does not intend by Green extremists. Green extremists will follow loggers around every part of Australia, and every time those loggers want to do a bit of logging and cut down a few trees the Green extremists will claim that they have discovered some endangered species, or site of special cultural or anthropological importance, which can only be dealt with by taking the area out of timber production. I believe that is a real danger. I will be happy to be proved wrong, but I fear I will be proved right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to realise that when dealing with Green extremists, we are not dealing with the sort of people who normally sit in the Federal Parliament or comprise the great majority of the membership of any of our organisations or institutions. We are dealing with fanatics. Even fanatics are entitled to some respect, I believe, if their views are held consistently, but consistency is conspicuously absent from the views and behaviour of our Green fanatics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will cite one example. The Green fanatic asserts that living standards and levels of consumption must be reduced. For example, we had Senator Chamarette in here yesterday saying that we do not need the mining industry because it gobbles up all the capital and does not provide many jobs. That, of course, expresses the views which are held by Green fanatics. They do not want the mining industry. They want to close down the mining industry, they want to close down the timber industry and, ultimately, they want to close down agriculture as well&mdash;at least, commercial agriculture as we know it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The base of their claimed belief system is that real incomes and standards of living must fall. But what do they do in practice? For a start, their own propaganda organisations such as the Australian Conservation Foundation would much rather sponge on the taxpayers for funding than solicit donations from their claimed myriad supporters who, if they genuinely subscribed to this doctrine, ought to be quite happy to take the opportunity to get rid of some of their disposable income voluntarily and thereby reduce their individual standards of living. They do not do that. They sponge on the taxpayers and they want to continue sponging on the taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Green party in Tasmania put up 35 candidates in the recent State election, 34 per cent of whom were teachers&mdash;a very disproportionate number of teachers. If support for the Greens is as strong within the teaching profession as those figures imply, there ought to be some countervailing faction or influence within the teachers' unions not to obtain increasing levels of salaries and wages&mdash;as all teachers' unions, in common with most other groups, do&mdash;but to take lower wages, so that living standards can be reduced in accordance with the Green doctrine to which they profess to adhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is even more directly relevant to the Senate is: how does Senator Chamarette, who is of course opposed to this legislation, believe that governments can afford to fund the sort of fiscal scam being perpetrated by her predecessor in the Senate, Senator Vallentine? Instead of the $85,000 lump sum payment to which she is entitled under the provisions of the legislation, former Senator Vallentine is attempting to obtain a lump sum payment of $165,000 plus a $16,500 pension indexed for life. How does Senator Chamarette believe that governments can afford to fund that sort of fiscal scam being attempted by her predecessor? If they followed her views, and the views of Green extremists in general, governments would be simultaneously closing down the industries that paid the taxes, to fund far more worthy areas of government expenditure than the fiscal scam which former Senator Vallentine is perpetrating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former Senator Vallentine has claimed that one of the reasons why she retired from the Senate was that it was `in accordance with the Green principle of rotating jobs'. I do not have any particular objection to the Green principle of rotating jobs. In former Senator Vallentine's case, she decided to rotate the job a bit more than six years after she got it. But she does not just want to rotate the job; she wants to pick up, instead of the $85,000 to which she is entitled under the legislation, a $165,000 lump sum plus an indexed pension of $16,500 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I invite Senator Chamarette, who unfortunately is not here, at the earliest possible opportunity to make a personal explanation to the Senate about whether she, too, supports the `Green principle of rotating jobs' embraced by former Senator Vallentine. If so&mdash;assuming she survives that long&mdash;does she, six or six and a half years hence, intend to resign from the Senate and emulate the example of her predecessor and attempt to pick up, not the $85,000 in present value dollars to which she would explicitly be entitled under the relevant legislation, but $165,000 plus $16,500 for life? I invite Senator Chamarette to take the opportunity to make a personal explanation, either later tonight or tomorrow, as to whether she accepts that Green principle and, if she does, whether she intends to follow former Senator Vallentine's example and repeat the same fiscal scam which she is attempting to run right now. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what the Forest Conservation and Development Bill was meant to achieve. Firstly, the Bill is meant to provide for the identification of forest areas of significant cultural, environmental and heritage value, and to provide for the protection and conservation of those areas. Secondly, it is meant to facilitate investment in enterprises in major wood processing projects for the production of value added products for export, import replacement or both. These are definitely sound objectives. It is unfortunate that the Bill is far from satisfactory in achieving them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Government, with this piece of legislation, has failed to address the real issues of the Australian timber industry. That industry urgently requires true resource security legislation that has been properly thought out&mdash;security that will provide for investment, security that will provide jobs and security that will provide a future for many people all over Australia who are tied to the timber industry. This Bill does not provide that security. It does allow an undefined or, should I say, an unlimited level of intervention by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy; it applies only to projects to a minimum value of $100m; and it results in bureaucratic duplication, regulation and red tape. Most importantly, however, it provides absolutely no security whatsoever for small businesses in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This very important part of the industry has been totally ignored by this legislation. What is the point of introducing resource security if a government is not going to provide it to the people who need it most? My office has received complaints from all areas of New South Wales about the Bill before the Senate tonight, asking for the right legislation to be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Government has failed to see that its lack of proper resource security is adversely affecting the families that are involved in these industries. This is obvious from recent correspondence. From the Bombala Timber Support Group in the south-east of New South Wales comes this comment on the legislation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If implemented in its present form, it would mean the end of our hardwood mills `Tablelands Bombala' and `Plateau Nimmitabel'. It is vitally important for future investment that resource security be granted but please take into consideration existing small timber companies.</PARA>
<PARA>All honourable senators would have seen the correspondence from Slater Contracting Company of Eden urging us to support the proposed amendments to the legislation so that it can once again employ trainees, expand staff and replace its ageing equipment, which will give a much needed boost to my former home town of Eden and will help get the economy going down there again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example is Ford Timbers, an employer of 120 people in northern New South Wales with $13m invested in various sawmills. The Managing Director of that company has stated that, unless the legislation caters for all players in the industry, the legislation is virtually worthless. The legislation in its current form will offer no long term security for the timber industry generally and it has to be amended if industry security is to be guaranteed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government fails to realise that these people are making a very significant contribution to the Australian economy, but that that contribution is in jeopardy due to the irresponsibility of this Labor Government. Of course, resource security legislation would simply not be necessary if it had not been for the past interference of the Federal Government that has destroyed confidence in the forest products industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lives of the people in the timber industry have been adversely affected by the past action of Labor and, because of the inadequacies of the current legislation, they must continue to live under the spectre of future government interference. This means that the capital necessary for industry to continue, let alone expand, will simply not be forthcoming. People will simply not invest. Banks will not lend when they cannot be assured that the Federal Government will not just come in on the side of any pressure group and restrict projects so much that they are no longer viable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people in the timber industry should not have to put up with such insecurity. It is an industry that directly employs thousands of people, and an even greater number indirectly. Many service towns depend on it. These people contribute to one of the biggest export industries in Australia. No-one would disagree that Australia needs more value-added exports, and that is what these industries can supply. So why is the Government refusing to recognise their importance?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great outcry from the forest products industry. Any resource security legislation needs to include all players. It needs to include the established industry and the small participants, not just new projects worth $100m. For this reason alone, the legislation has failed. But there are other problems that the legislation has also overlooked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has declared that it will not intervene in a project once it has been given the go-ahead under this legislation. The Government claims that these projects will have resource security. However, with this Bill the Minister reserves the right to act on a major and unforeseen environmental or cultural impact not identified at the time of initial access. This exceptionally broad provision gives the Minister enormous scope as there is no definition of what comprises an unforseen event. How can investors possibly feel that they have resource security when they do not know on what basis, or when, the Government can intervene in their particular project? This loophole in the Bill makes a farce of the whole purpose of resource security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet another problem with the Bill is that it provides the opportunity for total duplication of assessment and processes. The Bill is so broadly worded that it permits the uncooperative overlapping of procedures. It does this because it requires assessment by the Commonwealth Government not only of environmental factors but also of social, cultural and economic factors. It is therefore duplicating, once again, State processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet again, industry is stifled and inhibited by bureaucratic processes. Layer upon layer of regulations already bog down what projects are able to get under way. These delays are costly and often fatal to projects.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Coulter rightly observed, the Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991 neither conserves forests nor does it develop them. Its title is really quite a misnomer and is misleading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept of resource security, which has been at the heart of much of what has been said about this Bill, has a basic illogicality about it. It is an illogicality which, I suggest, is derived from the colonial concept of land grants. Land was granted with freehold title to those who were already privileged enough to have sufficient capital to engage in what was then described as the fight to tame mother nature, to tame the land. But this was done for profit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this may have been thought appropriate in the colonial period of our history&mdash;and there is even a considerable body of opinion to suggest that it was not appropriate even then&mdash;the fact is that this country is not now a colonial outpost, and such colonial attitudes are not appropriate. The concept that is embodied in what I have just described is supported and promoted in this very Bill. It is promoted by those people who wish to privatise all enterprises. I suggest that that is where the illogicality lies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is proposed to remove a significant proportion of all commercial risks by using a public resource while retaining private commercial control over that resource. In other words, control over that resource, which has been defined, mapped and protected from the ravages of fire, flood and pests, at great cost to the community&mdash;a resource which has been nurtured by the community&mdash;will now be dedicated exclusively to the profitable exploitation of private investors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is illogical because those who believe that the markets should rule and those who do not believe in the public ownership of enterprises are the very same people who support this Bill&mdash;the very antithesis of a market-driven enterprise. In this Bill the resource is not subjected to market forces; rather, it is provided&mdash;I will have more to say about that word later&mdash;exclusively with guarantees to a limited select group of entrepreneurs. The Opposition rightly criticises the lack of consideration given to other potential users of the resource&mdash;the smaller sawmillers, the specialists or even smaller integrated enterprises. That is about where its concern stops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard little mention in the debate so far about the artists&mdash;the sculptors, the people who engage in the craft of marquetry, which we see such fantastic examples of in this place, the craftsmen, the jewellers and the producers of imaginative furniture and chattels. Those people's access to this resource has not been a concern expressed by the coalition so far. These talented artisans add immense value to resources which are not even recognised by others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will take some time to relate an anecdote which is most relevant in this situation. In 1987 I was lucky enough to be introduced to a carpenter who had successfully engaged in a building project which involved building five domestic cottages in a most idyllic setting in a seaside area of Hobart. The fascination of these cottages is that they were built from timber which had been described by Tasmania's Forestry Commission as non-existent. The cottages were built from considerably large section poles of celery-top pine, a timber which is renowned in Tasmania for its special qualities. It is an attractive timber which is durable, hard and strong and has a beautiful honey colour, such that it is often confused with Huon pine. It has a close grain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These cottages had been built out of celery pine logs and sections which have been described by our Forestry Commission as non-existent. They were non-existent because there had been a clear-felling operation and a firewood-gathering operation, a licence had been granted to craft-wood gatherers and there had been a regeneration burn over these logs. In other words, according to our Forestry Commission all gettable useful timber had been removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This carpenter, with a small one-tonne Toyota truck, had been able to glean sufficient timber from this area to build, at considerable profit to himself and considerable satisfaction to the owners, five beautiful cottages which stand to this day as a testament to the ignorance of the Forestry Commission advisers at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other anecdote that I would like to give is a very personal one. This week I was trying to have built for me an extension to my house, which involved a new kitchen bench. I thought it would be rather attractive to use some of this celery-top pine. I found that this attractive timber is not purchasable in Tasmania, the State in which it is endemic. It is not possible to buy sufficient celery-top pine in Tasmania to make one kitchen bench. It is available in Victoria. I would have to buy it in Victoria where it is being sent from Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why has this nonsense perpetuated? Because small efficient local mills are unable to gain access to the resource. Even now, such enterprises have been denied access by those who control the forest resource. I believe this is next to criminal because the resource is not particularly scarce. As a matter of fact, in several places it is quite plentiful. It is unavailable in Tasmania because the timber gathering methods that are used, and the size of the enterprises needed to afford the machinery which uses those methods, prevails in such a way that the specialist timbers have become unattainable. I cannot buy that particular type of timber this week because of the very methods that are used in harvesting our timbers in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clear-felling mentality dominates our forest resource extraction methods. There is no longer room for the specialist miller who selectively logs for specific purposes. The only method that is used and endorsed by the Forestry Commission is to indiscriminately cut all trees and to categorise the logs so obtained. This is very much a mechanical process; it is not a labour intensive process. The typical machinery that is used in this process is able to cut, lop, strip, debark and load a log onto a truck. One machine and one operator are used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not listen to all of Senator Sherry's contribution; I got a little excited about his references to our approach to this matter. I suspect that Senator Sherry is perhaps caught up in the romanticism of some of the timber worker pictures that he may have seen. The old pictures of the well-muscled timber workers who scale the forest giants and open the face with a kelly axe, stand on wooden planks with steel shoes that are magically stable and then heroically swish through the huge trunk with a two-man broadsaw should be forgotten. It does not apply any more; it is not there. That image has disappeared. Thousands of such skilled workers have been forced to leave the industry and have been replaced by the machinery which the large companies have been able to afford. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry is no longer labour intensive. The efficient use of the modern tree-harvesting machinery requires that a uniform tree size and description is tackled. Smaller, larger, shorter or longer trees are actually a nuisance. I suspect that is why it is very difficult to buy specialist timbers. Different species get in the way. At this stage the price differential hardly justifies the effort required to recognise the species, to trim it properly and to place it aside. It has been said to me that it is more efficient to use the machinery to squash the minor species than to leave them behind as fuel for the infamous regeneration burn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have here another example of a recently developed myth which has been used to justify the practices which monolithic forest exploiters have recently developed. The fact is that fire has always been part of the scenery in Australian eucalypt forests. There is another indisputable fact that other species, such as banksias, are able to survive low intensity fires and then prosper in the post-fire environment where competition has been reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a fact that huge broadacre fires are not necessary to provide regeneration. It is not a fact that such broadacre fires have been a regular part of the ecology of our old growth forests. Just as small-scale selective harvesting can provide us with specialised timbers, so can they be followed by small-scale fires which can provide the regeneration necessary to retain the character of eucalypt forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal with a couple of other myths as well. It is a fact, as was mentioned by Senator Newman, that Tasmania needs jobs. It is a simplistic statement which is a truism. Senator Newman continued to follow on with something about which I admire her perceptiveness in bringing to this chamber. She told us that if APPM provides a pulp mill it may provide jobs. But that company has not yet said that it will provide a pulp mill. I emphasise the word `provide'. Her choice of words makes it seem almost as though the company was going to present us with a pulp mill as a gift. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with Senator Newman's perceptive observation that no individual or company has yet guaranteed investment of any nature if this legislation passes. In other words, no Bill, no mill. But if the Bill passes, will mills be guaranteed? The answer is no. Senator Newman was right in her perceptions. It is a myth that passage of this Bill could deliver projects, jobs, or anything else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of correspondence has been quoted, particularly by members of the coalition from whom we have had emotional blackmail to encourage the passage of this Bill&mdash;blackmail which has suggested that, unless the Bill passes, certain projects will not occur, certain things cannot continue. I agree strongly with Senator Newman that no guarantees have been delivered by any of that correspondence. A great deal of fear has been delivered, but no guarantees. The promise of downstream processing which might derive after the passage of this Bill is a hollow promise. I assure those interested in this issue that real downstream processing will not occur. Woodchipping will occur, pulping might occur, but the real value adding will not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found myself experiencing quite a strange set of emotions, as I was agreeing with Senator Campbell. That is something I have not done before and it was quite an experience. I was pleasantly surprised. I must make a fuss about this because Senator Campbell got it right. He described to us the benefits of private nurturing and developing of forests in South America and in South Australia. Senator Campbell rightly observed that some of the forest products&mdash;such as resins, oil pigments, brazil nuts and rainforest crunch peanuts&mdash;had been profitably extracted from forests in South America under private ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Campbell mentioned correctly Dr John Walmsley in South Australia who has nurtured a forest and derived a considerable income from it. He has given tens of thousands of people considerable satisfaction from visiting the forest which he has nurtured. The important thing to note is that Dr Walmsley has purchased the land; the investment in the forest has been paid for entirely by him and it is in his title. He owns the resource and he has the ultimate security over that resource&mdash;he has paid for it. That is vastly different from what is proposed here. To ensure proper security of resource, its title should be bought and fully paid for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator O'Chee interested me with his contribution, part of which I listened to. He again engaged in the correspondence reading device. He suggested that hundreds of millions of dollars invested in softwood plantations would be wasted because such plantations cannot be milled unless the hardwood mills have been granted security over the forest resource. I would describe that as utter nonsense. It illustrates a total misunderstanding of the milling industry, an industry which in many cases&mdash;certainly in Tasmania&mdash;has mills based on the harvesting of specific species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmanian sawmills specialising in the plantation harvesting and production of radiata pine logs and radiata pine planks for both building work and furniture construction are not threatened by the rejection of this Bill&mdash;quite the opposite. Such plantation industries have developed their resource, they have security over their softwood plantation resource, and they have the sort of security which Senator Campbell mentioned as most desirable: they own their resource. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also agreed with Senator Macdonald. He read from a letter to him which suggested that this legislation was to provide security to pulp mills, paper mills and multinationals but not to the smaller operators, especially sawmills. </PARA>

I am sorry that I do not expect his acknowledgment of agreement with what I am about to say next. Apart from the omission of the smaller operators, the whole concept of resource security as described in this debate rests entirely upon the exploitation of timber in our forests. We have heard about timber as though it were the only resource available from our forests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The omissions are well understood by most Tasmanians. I am surprised that the Tasmanian senators who have contributed to this debate so far have not mentioned this aspect. We in Tasmania should all be well aware of the fact that scenery is a resource. The tourist industry has been ridiculed for decades because it is seen as a soft industry. It is not one of those hard, driving, tough industries involving lots of noisy machinery and crashing, crunching and bashing about. It is not a macho industry at all. It is considered a soft industry. The fact that it was ridiculed for some decades is ridiculous. The tourist industry is a huge export industry. We do not export the views, but tourists travel to our scenery and pay us with their foreign currency to look at it. That resource is not guaranteed by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The biological diversity of our forests is an unquantifiable resource which we have not yet fully tapped. Through our own ignorance we know little of the chemical, medicinal, genetic and agricultural treasures which are hidden in our old growth forests. The fauna of our forests is also a resource which is not guaranteed by this legislation. The biological diversity includes our former species. These treasures of our Australian heritage are threatened directly by the clear-felling, large scale, machinery-driven, broadacre fire regime which this legislation would encourage. Our native fauna is a resource which is not guaranteed by this legislation any more than our native flora is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is even another resource that is not guaranteed by this legislation. I hesitate to mention it because by doing so one draws attention to the fact that it is not guaranteed. As a result of this, we could see a proposition that seeks somehow to guarantee it. Senator Panizza would be understandably disappointed that exploiters of our mineral resources which may be found in our forests will receive no guarantees from this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by repeating the basic observation which has been made so often about our forests. This Bill is entitled the Forest Conservation and Development Bill. The observation which has been made, and which I repeat, is that forests are not developed by clear-felling. To develop our forests we need to nurture them. That is not necessarily incompatible with proper, selective gleaning of the resources of our forests. I would never support the proposition that we do not glean resources from these forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gathering of timber, the processing of timber and the value adding of any of the resources is not incompatible with the nurturing of the forest as itself. This attitude is one which, throughout history, has been proven to be correct. We know of the cultural, sociological and economic development of our society that has been possible through entering forests to glean resources, not to harm the development of the forests but to protect them from the ravages of fire, plague or any other threats which might come to them and then to be able to revisit the forests to gain from them the resources which have been regenerated by the fact that we have been able to nurture them. Many previous generations of smaller sawmillers have followed those sorts of practices and they have nurtured and protected our forests without destroying them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central theme of what I have said tonight in contribution to this debate has been that modern forestry practices and methods are the greatest threats to our forests. In my opinion, they pose a threat of turning what is now forest into monoculture. That would bring the hazards of any sort of monoculture: the susceptibility to pests; the susceptibility to fluctuations in world markets; and the danger of damaging the substructure of the soil which provides the basis for that culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Monocultures bring with them many hazards. We fail to recognise that modern forestry practice is essentially monoculture. We do not pay sufficient regard to that. We do not recognise that what we are doing is a cheap version of tree farming. If we were honest and faced up to that, we would not disguise such forestry practices as forestry practices. We would not try to pretend that what we were doing was forestry. We would face up to what it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These modern forestry practices are encouraged by the very nature and content of this Bill because of the inadequacies that have been properly identified by the coalition. Also, this Bill does not recognise the other resources that are contained within our forests. It does not make provision for their development, just as it does not make any proper provision for the development of the timber industries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Forest Conservation and Development Bill. Firstly, I support my colleagues with regard to this legislation; that is, I oppose it unless the Government is prepared to accept the Opposition's amendments. I add that these amendments have the support of NAFI and the unions involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to highlight a couple of areas in which this Bill fails. I have no intention of going over all of the areas because my colleagues have already done that. Particularly relative to the Western Australian situation, this Bill does not include security for business operations under $100m. Even then, the security for the $100m is of dubious value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point I wish to raise, which was brought out very succinctly by Senator Walsh, is the fact that this Bill will give those extremists in the conservation movement or the extreme greenies a legal opportunity to harass loggers, to follow them around looking for areas where they can take action, under the protection of a Bill, to stop that logging. That is a very bad aspect of this particular legislation. In that sense, it gives no security whatsoever. Of course, the flow-on impact of that down the line will mean that we will see, I believe, the most organised harassment of an industry ever seen in Australia. That will cost many people in the chain of the forestry industry their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to mention the Western Australian position because I have had representations from people in Western Australia; my colleagues have also had representations from people in their States. I wish to mention the State branch of the National Association of Forest Industries and, in particular, Trish Townsend and a group of people she brought to see me in my office last week. That group consisted of sawmillers, people in the transport area of the forest industry, people working in the mills, representatives of the unions involved in the full chain of the forest operation in Western Australia. To a person they agreed, after we had discussed this legislation, that it should be opposed unless the Government is prepared to accept our proposed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to make some comments about the existing Western Australian system with regard to the management of forests. I firmly believe that it is, in fact, an area that the Commonwealth should keep right out of. It should be left to the States. Western Australia has provided the model by which this can be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was fortunate this week to do a tour of our south-west forests with Mr Peter Johnson, who is the manager of the Kruger National Park in South Africa, and Dr Syd Shea, who is the Director of the Department of Conservation and Land Management in Western Australia. It was spelt out quite clearly, in terms of the forest operation in Western Australia, that the Department does take into account the various values, some of which Senator Bell has just raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It takes into account, for example, the importance of tourism and forestry to tourism. It takes into account conservation values in the sense of salinity control, water control and water preservation. It takes into account conservation requirements with regard to flora and fauna. But importantly also, it has a reasonable and rational manner for dealing with forestry. It has designated certain areas of the forest for particular uses. That does not preclude, except in the case of national parks, the other various values being utilised throughout the whole forest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention some of the things that we saw in terms of the management of forest. One of the most outstanding things we saw was forests that had been severely affected by dieback, fire and a number of other minor problems cleared and replanted with karri trees. We saw areas where karri trees had been planted some 40 years ago. We also saw the various stages of trees, those that were planted 40 years ago and those that were planted six months ago. We saw karri trees that were planted just six months ago which today are about two-thirds of a metre high. They are thriving and growing back in the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also saw in some areas where globulus had been planted and those trees were thriving and doing very well. We saw how CALM operated in terms of logging, sawmilling, and the thinning and removing of undesirable species. I want to say that that is the type of model by which we should be managing our forests so that we do utilise or maintain the various values in conjunction with a profitable, successful forestry industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish now to touch on the other aspect of forestry that has developed in Western Australia, that is, on-farm forest production. I was fortunate back in 1986 to be involved with the manager of CALM and the then State Government Minister in putting together what is now known as the on-farm forestry policy. That policy developed a number of aspects. Probably the most important one that I wish to mention here is a model of a sharefarming agreement which allows, in conjunction with the Department of Conservation and Land Management and also with WACAP, sharefarming agreements to be put together, thus enabling private land holders to participate in forest production in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essence of these agreements is a joint effort between the farmer and CALM or WACAP. Trees are planted either by the farmer, CALM or WACAP and a system of payments is put in place, whereby the farmer can be paid an annuity per year for the estimated life of the forest. Through that operation, agreement can be reached, for example, over a 10-year period, which is the usual time taken. The farmer can take a 10 per cent annuity if he chooses on the estimated value of the forest at the end of the time or, if he so wishes, when negotiating that share farming agreement, he can take a 5 per cent annuity of the estimated value which would leave 50 per cent at the end of the 10 years. Then CALM or WACAP will share equally in the price that is obtained at the end of the 10-year period. That demonstrates quite clearly that commercial, private, on-farm forestry can operate successfully alongside those public areas in Western Australia that have been designated for forest use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make some comments about the Commonwealth and its role and, in particular, the Australian Heritage Commission. Over the last 12 months the Australian Heritage Commission has looked at forest areas which have heritage value and has identified them. It has come to a very successful agreement with CALM or the State Government concerning those areas that have been identified. However, then it became greedy. It decided&mdash;without any discussion with the private land-holders involved&mdash;that it would list 300 farms under the National Heritage Listing. That meant that the contributions of all the farmers who had gone into share-farming agreements with CALM and WACAP, made an investment and planted trees were being put at risk. As I am sure all honourable senators know, the Australian Heritage Commission has enormous powers. Fortunately, through political pressure and other means, it has been forced to withdraw that heritage nomination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make the point that the Commonwealth Government should keep right out of this area. It should be left to the type of agreement and arrangements that we have in Western Australia. The action of the Australian Heritage Commission was an infringement of the rights of those individual private landholders&mdash;and this is where I disagree with some of the statements made by Senator Bell. He inferred that under private landhold arrangements and forestry their product would be safe. In fact, under the current Australian Heritage legislation, it is not safe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I wish to refer to concerns the genuineness of this Government about this legislation. I suspect&mdash;and I have it on good authority&mdash;that Mr Keating, the Prime Minister, and also Senator Richardson, who sits in this chamber, would dearly love this legislation to be defeated, because they could then say to the Australian public, `We have tried', and yet at the same time say to the greenies, `Well, we have not really done anything. You still have the same situation as you had before'. I question the Government's genuineness and the Opposition will test it when we come to the amendments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991. Before I begin my criticism of the Government's action and of the contents of the Bill I must declare an interest, because one of the beneficiaries in this legislation is APPM and I currently have a logging contract with that company. However, that might mean that I bring a very practical perspective to this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is indeed a very bad piece of legislation. It is bad because it really does not offer the sort of security that it pretends to offer. It is a label without substance. It does not affect the Commonwealth's decision-making power in relation to world heritage and conservation, for example, and I refer to clause 25. It permits another Act to be put through this place that overrules the present Act and actually encourages those who are against logging to go out into the forests and discover species for the purpose of ending logging in that area. Currently, there are some very unacceptable provisions in clauses 9 and 23 concerning no compensation. However, I understand that some verbal undertakings have been given that these may be withdrawn. I certainly hope so. That will improve the quality of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of reasons why this Bill is attracting so much attention at present. Since 1985 there has been a heated and often highly politicised forestry debate which has been waged both on the mainland and certainly in Tasmania. Speaking from Tasmania's point of view, I have to say that the Commonwealth Government has not had a very good record of upholding any agreements it has made with the Tasmanian forest industry, and nationally the industry is not prepared to invest in value added or other projects without resource security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1985, the Tasmanian woodchip industry, represented by APPM, Forest Products and Forest Resources along with the Forestry Commission put together an environmental impact statement&mdash;an EIS&mdash;for the industry. A number of environmental issues were looked at in putting this publication together, including how special areas should be managed. A number of working papers relating to the environmental impact study were also presented after a substantial amount of research. A lot of work was also done on the measurement of the available resource on both Crown land and private property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once this EIS was complete, Mr John Kerin, on behalf of the Federal Government, signed a memorandum of understanding dated 12 June 1986. This memorandum of understanding ratified forest management systems in Tasmania and specified requirements for further research. This research has been ongoing. It is administered by the Tasmanian Forest Research Council under a person at the University of Tasmania and is funded by a levy on woodchip exported from Tasmania imposed by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This memorandum of understanding was thought to be an agreement which the State and the forest industries could work to and use as a planning tool. It was thought that the Federal Government was happy that the forestry operation should go ahead as per the environmental impact study. The fact that it had been signed by Mr Kerin as the Minister indicated this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the memorandum of understanding was broken by the Federal Government within six months of it being signed. Although the environmental impact study stated that logging management plans under two areas, Jackeys Marsh and Lemonthyme, were to be logged, the Federal Government did not allow logging to proceed under these plans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In late 1986, another committee was established to look at whether logging should be allowed in the Jackeys Marsh and the Lemonthyme areas. The committee consisted of five members. Three of those members recommended that the Lemonthyme area not be logged. Similarly, three of the five recommended that Jackeys Marsh be logged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the Nix report, the then Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke, via the press, stepped in and stopped the logging in Jackeys Marsh and the removal of pulpwood from Lemonthyme. The then Minister, Mr John Kerin, on hearing about the announcement when he arrived back from overseas, immediately apologised and said that it could not be correct. Needless to say, poor John Kerin had his knuckles rapped and the announcement stood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry was immediately stopped in its tracks without ever a letter by the Prime Minister having been received or without ever any justification having been put either to the industry or, for that matter, to the Forestry Commission which managed the forests on behalf of the Tasmanian people. It was a disgraceful situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst on the topic of Jackeys Marsh, let us dwell for a moment on its history. The area was nominated for National Estate in the mid-1980s and put on the interim list virtually straightaway, which afforded it National Estate status. The listing was finally gazetted in February this year, some seven years later&mdash;and then only after much review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons for National Estate nomination as per the application to the Australian Heritage Commission were twofold: firstly, it was claimed that there were a number of rare and endangered plant species&mdash;this is one of the weaknesses of the Bill&mdash;which had made it worthy of listing. Secondly, and more generally, it was claimed that there were landscape and aesthetic values&mdash;this is already covered by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final listing has rejected the aesthetic values and has confirmed, in much smaller areas than those first nominated, that the plant species concerned justify listing. In listing these plant species, though, it is acknowledged&mdash;and I emphasise this&mdash;that the species were found to be also present in logged-over coupes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether the Prime Minister has ever stopped to reconsider the decision he made in 1987. In hindsight, and scientifically speaking, it was definitely a wrong decision from all points of view. The then Prime Minister then made his `no more logging in Jackeys Marsh' statement. He also announced a further inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of those present would remember the Helsham inquiry which commenced in 1987 and ran for something like 12 months. While the Helsham inquiry was, specifically on World Heritage qualifications, of a circumscribed area&mdash;that is, the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests&mdash;it also investigated the whole spectrum of native forest management issues, the significance of the forestry industry in Tasmania and the impact on that industry of any change in resource accessibility as a result of a change of World Heritage boundaries. The upshot of that, again in terms of forest management, was that, while there was and will always be further research needed, in general forest management was not producing unacceptable impacts on native forests and that the industry was efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This led to the Cook-Groom agreement of late 1988. Senator Cook, the then Minister for Resources, and Ray Groom, the State Minister for forests, again ratified forest management systems in areas outside the World Heritage area. The agreement also declared that the Government would not unilaterally impose any more World Heritage listings in Tasmania. But this Bill specifically provides that this may happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two of the Helsham commissioners also recommended that a very small fraction&mdash;about 10 per cent of the inquiry area&mdash;should be proposed to UNESCO for World Heritage listing. The other commissioner recommended essentially that all the inquiry area should be included while Senator Richardson suggested that well over 100 per cent of the inquiry area should be listed. That is what happened; 100 per cent was listed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So time and time again the Tasmanian forest industry has been inquired into and given a rating on its operations. Yet time and time again the Federal Government, for whatever reason, has gone back on its agreements and made decisions which have no reference to the inquiry's findings. This Bill provides the opportunity for history to be repeated again and again. In fact, I submit that, as a result of this Bill, there are even more opportunities than ever before for this to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previously, the Government has broken written agreements. This is the real reason that the industry distrusts the Government and now wants resource security legislation. John Hewson has said that, under a Federal Liberal government, resource security would not be needed. We can trust John Hewson. Effectively, the Government threw science out the window and did what was at the time politically more acceptable to the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As if there had not been inquiries enough already, the Resource Assessment Commission started a forest inquiry in November 1989. It has put its final report on that inquiry in to the Prime Minister in the last day or two. While this inquiry is national in scope, it still represents in part yet another inquiry into Tasmanian forestry practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without knowing exactly what the final draft says, the draft report, put out in the middle of last year, and subsequent meetings between industry and the RAC have essentially confirmed that modern forestry practice in native forests presents no problems. For example, the RAC draft report explicitly notes that no species extinctions can be attributed to forestry in the 200 years of white settlement. That is a very significant statement. The Commission has also confirmed the importance of the industry and, in general, its efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the latest of the inquiries at a State level, the Forest and Forest Industries Council and the production of a forest and forest industry strategy, has been going on over the last two years. This inquiry also put forest management practice under the microscope. In this case, the environmental lobby was involved for the majority of the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relevance of the FFIC and that process is that it has led to State resource security legislation which incorporates procedures for protecting new values as these become apparent, within a broad framework of certainty of access to resource for the industry. In other words, resource security does not by definition preclude the protection of values. It simply imposes a discipline on governments to make sure that they can justify further restrictions. But that is not the case with the Federal legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the last seven years, the life of Tasmania's forest industry has been one long, continuous inquiry interspersed with agreements that have not been upheld. Not one inquiry has resulted in a more secure working environment for the industry, and that is indeed regrettable. What will it take for confidence to be restored to Australia's forest industry, and for that industry to feel assured of its future and start to plan ahead? The answer is quite simple: all it wants is workable resource security legislation while we have this present Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991 is to be referred to a committee because, as it stands, it is not a workable piece of legislation in terms of providing the needed security. The national bodies do not help because they seem to have three positions. Australia's forest industry, particularly in Tasmania, has been through a torrid seven years, and it is the Federal Government which has put it through this torrid time. I put on record that I strongly support the amendments that have been proposed and I trust that reason will prevail so that this Senate can deliver a proper Bill. Tasmanians then will be able to breathe a sigh of relief as the passage of this Bill, correctly amended, will ensure that a pulp mill will be built in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">APPM is indeed a very brave company at this time. It is important to note that it has allocated, through North Broken Hill, a sum of money for the development of a pulp mill. That amount of money will not stay there indefinitely because there are alternative uses in a mining group which can utilise effectively and efficiently those investment moneys. Therefore, it is up to the Senate to give the directors the confidence to proceed with a pulp mill which will make a great deal of difference in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">APPM has stated that there are three remaining items to be completed before it enters the 72-week State-Federal Government assessment procedure that will examine the environmental, economic, social and community impact of the mill. Therefore, a lot of criteria have to be met. One of them, naturally, is resource security, which we hope the Bill, in an appropriately amended form, will deliver. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a requirement for the Commonwealth to complete its studies on Tasmanian forests. That requires the cooperation of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) who is known to be not a great supporter of this legislation. So we will see further tension within this Government, further procrastination and delay. Even though we may get the resource security legislation, the Government still has this vehicle&mdash;this second tier&mdash;by which the poor old company has to wait while the Government completes its studies on the Tasmanian forests. The industry has been through seven torrid years, with numerous inquiries, broken agreements and still another vulnerable hurdle has to be overcome. Yet, to the credit of APPM, it is prepared to wait. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not only does APPM deserve the Victoria Cross, but also it is a company that deserves some recognition. It is prepared to put its money up, but the conditions are pretty tough. It also needs a partner because the mill is going to be on a world scale. If this Bill is not passed, it will be so much more difficult for such a company to attract a partner on an international scale. We trust, from certain discussions, that the Government may be prepared to delete the no compensation clause&mdash;clause 23&mdash;which would also involve clause 9.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the Tasmanian Government has placed its confidence in this project. Both the Commonwealth and the State of Tasmania have undertaken to enter into an intergovernmental agreement designed to ensure that alternative wood, at no additional cost, would be made available to the mill in the event that further areas of forest were to be locked up in the future. Certainly the Tasmanian Government would honour that agreement, but the manner in which the Federal Government has walked away from signed agreements, signed undertakings, does not give people a lot of optimism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us hope that the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs which will be examining this Bill can put the Bill in order, after appropriate input from a wide range of participants and interest groups, to ensure that when this Bill comes back into this Senate next Thursday it will be passed. Thus, the forest industry will be given a measure&mdash;and that is all we can really say&mdash;of comfort which it is prepared to accept, so that it can concentrate on future growth and prosperity and, in Tasmania's case, the economic well-being of the State, instead of just having an inquiry or another series of inquiries. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight we are debating the Forest Conservation and Development Bill. It is an attempt by the forest industry and the unions to get some sort of working harmony that will allow development in the industry. The Government has said that it is not prepared to help, under any circumstances, unless people are prepared to spend $100m. So, in effect, the legislation before the Senate tonight will give resource protection to a proposed pulp mill only, the APPM, which I believe the Government desperately needs. The $100m threshold contained in the Bill is far in excess of any other company's investments in Australia. It is just another indication that the Government has really deserted the timber industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp says the Government has deserted the timber industry in Victoria, Senator Watson says it has deserted the timber industry in Tasmania and I can certainly vouch for the Government's desperate attitude to the timber industry in Queensland.

This is one of the few areas where semi-skilled workers have some sort of employment potential. It is one of the very few areas where we can offer them jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These jobs cannot be created unless the Government is prepared to accept the amendments proposed by the industry and the unions. The Government appears to have no inclination to do that. I do not know how members of the ALP can come down here and turn their backs on their constituents. Is the ALP trying to fill the niche market that the Democrats have taken? Is it a party for the worker any more? No wonder a union, the AWU, in Tasmania has said that the ALP no longer represents the worker and has disaffiliated itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are at least 100,000 jobs, and there could be another 40,000 jobs, that could be provided if this legislation were to go through with the amendments. Unless this legislation goes through, we will not even hold the employment line that we now have in the timber industry. There will be more lay-offs because of the Government's failure to back the industry and union amendments. The banks would not put confederate money into the timber industry at the moment unless there was some type of security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Really, the Labor Party has to make up its mind where its political niche is in the marketplace. It has to make a decision as to whether it will walk away from its past. It has to make a decision as to where it stands and what its prospects are for the future. It also has to decide, in the light of its centenary last year when many of its heavies gathered under the Tree of Knowledge in Barcaldine, whether it is a working man's party, or whether it is a party that represents only the environmentalist.

Those small communities that relied on the timber industry, like Ravenshoe, have been turned into a disaster area&mdash;broken marriages, wrecked businesses, people losing their self-respect and skilled fourth and fifth generation workers put on very menial jobs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Maryborough the Goss Government has made the same commitment, saying it will compensate Maryborough and the timber industry. It has taken the heat off in the short term, but the timber industry deserves better than that. It is not Australia's biggest rural industry but it is the largest regional employer in regional Australia, and it deserves some long term future. The Government could give that long term future tonight if it were not beholden to the Phillip Toynes of this world and the Green movement. The Government may feel it is in debt to the Green movement because it ensured the Government's return to power at the last election. But in paying off that debt, the Government is short changing its grassroots union members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The timber industry needs a base to work on. If it could have resource security it could invest in the long term by developing plantations, employing more people, gaining investment and borrowing money.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No doubt the reservations are on the record, Senator Tambling, and they are well-known, not that we accept them. Nonetheless, I am merely indicating the broad direction of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the National Party, Senator Boswell, has just concluded his remarks, and there are two points I want to make before he leaves the chamber, since he is edging towards the door. First, he has propounded the preposterous notion that somehow or other I am in the pocket of the Greens. I think that even Senator Boswell would admit, perhaps in the back bar over a beer, that there is not a single Green in Australia who would lay claim to me. That is a well-known fact. Therefore, the credibility of Senator Boswell's statement is basically false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, and more importantly, Senator Boswell said in his remarks&mdash;and I took notes&mdash;that the Government has deserted the timber industry. I want the record of this debate to show that it is this Government that has brought to this chamber legislation for resource security for the timber industry, and it is the Opposition that is opposing it. Let us get that right. We support it; we have brought it here. The Opposition opposes it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On 29 November 1991, the Government introduced this Bill, the Forest Conservation and Development Bill. In introducing the Bill, the Government thought there was some prospect of this Parliament hearing some rational debate on what clearly is a significant and important issue confronting Australia and this industry. But I must say that having listened to the more recent debates and the earlier debates on second reading, I have witnessed a contribution from the Opposition that has made it very clear that this chamber and Australia have lost the opportunity for a rational debate because of the irrational content of much of what the Opposition has said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When introducing this legislation, the Government wrote to the relevant Opposition shadow Ministers informing them that while the objects of the legislation were in themselves straightforward, the detail of the legislation was complex. Because of this, the Government extended an invitation to the Opposition to meet and discuss the legislation prior to this second reading debate. But did the Opposition accept that invitation? The answer to that question, as the Opposition knows, is that it did not. Instead of an informed and rational debate, we have witnessed an ill-informed second reading debate on an issue of considerable national importance. More is the pity, and the pity resides, I think, with the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Rather than oppose this legislation, the Opposition should grasp the opportunity to try to understand it. It may well rue its failure to do so. This Opposition, notwithstanding its facade of wanting to get major projects started in Australia, has adopted a duplicitous position of saying that it would on the one hand build Wesley Vale, but hypocritically is opposing this legislation which is so necessary to enable a northern Tasmanian pulp mill. Previous Government speakers have asked the Opposition these questions. Why is the Opposition forsaking the national interest for short term political expediency? Why will the Opposition not allow the world scale northern Tasmanian pulp mill project to proceed? The only answer to that question is that the Opposition is prepared to forsake the national interest because it mistakenly believes that there is short term political gain in adopting the position that it has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I consider the Opposition's position, I have to ask myself: where are those politicians in Australia who are prepared to consider the issue on its merit rather than for short term political gain?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me explain why this is so. North Broken Hill, the company which would build the Wesley Vale pulp mill, recently issued a press statement urging the Opposition to support the passage of this legislation through the Parliament. North Broken Hill said:</PARA>

<PARA>North Broken Hill said that enabling this legislation to go through would be a significant step in allowing Wesley Vale to proceed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have said, in December last year. If Senator Tambling would stop interjecting and listen to my argument he would perhaps be persuaded, but he has allowed his own prejudice to creep in. Again, in opposing this legislation the Opposition is prepared to forsake the national interest. On 23 December last year, the company intending to invest in a $850m expansion of its Maryvale plant, Australian Paper Manufacturers&mdash;another major manufacturer in Australia&mdash;said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We accept the involvement of the Federal Government in the concept of resource security and will work with the Victorian and Federal governments and the National Association of Forest Industries to reach appropriate guarantees through legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>To cap it all, the company, North Broken Hill, wrote to the Government on 25 February this year&mdash;and, we believe, wrote also to the Opposition in similar vein&mdash;and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the proposed resource security legislation currently before the House, we would urge that this legislation progress as rapidly as possible as it is our opinion that this will provide an immediate signal to potential partners of the willingness of the Federal Government to create the necessary environment to allow the development of this nationally important project.</PARA>
<PARA>North Broken Hill has now confirmed that the revised depreciation regime announced by the Government's One Nation package meets its requirements in the case of Wesley Vale&mdash;that is, that the company would build a world scale pulp mill now. It says that this Government's depreciation arrangements, as announced in the One Nation package, meet its approval. Yet the Opposition is still opposing the passage of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not ask this question lightly, but it must be asked: is the Opposition trying to marshal a capital strike at the expense of the national interest? I wonder what Ray Groom, the new Tasmanian Premier, feels about having his main election pledge blown out of the water by the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Groom committed himself to building three new pulp mills in Tasmania. Without this legislation, there will be no investment and Premier Groom and the Tasmanian Liberals will not be able to deliver on their election pledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmanian Liberal Senators Archer, Calvert, Newman, Walters and Watson, together with Tasmanian Liberal members of parliament, well know that they have to accept a decision so obviously against the interests of their own State&mdash;in this case, Tasmania. These members know what is in the interests of Tasmania; indeed, most privately support the legislation. They still have an opportunity to represent their State. They should summon the courage to demand that Dr Hewson allow the legislation to pass through the Senate, which would mean a vote for jobs in Tasmania and a vote for growth in Tasmania. They should stand up for the views of the Tasmanian Liberal Premier who has condemned the Federal Liberals on this issue. What did Ray Groom say? This is what he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't mind saying I want the coalition in Canberra to support the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Tasmanian Premier said. That is from a State House. Honourable senators here from Tasmania are elected to represent their State; that is the view of their own Premier; why do they not back him?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only have the Federal Liberals marginalised Tasmanian Liberals, they have also done the same to the coalition of local councils in northern Tasmania. On Monday of this week, the Chairman of `Tasmanians for the Future' wrote to the Opposition pleading with it to minimise its demands on the legislation and support the passage of the Bill through the Senate. Having had that, the Opposition has brought a lot of passion to this debate but, I must say, very little conviction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's revised position can be summarised as these points: firstly, the legislation should allow for State forest industry investment programs which do not meet the $100m eligibility threshold; and secondly, the compensation provisions should be removed from the Bill and wood compensation arrangements provided through inter-governmental agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to reaffirm the Government's position on each of these points. Concerning the first proposed amendment relating to the eligibility of forest industry investment programs, the Government fully appreciates the important role which the sawmilling sector plays in the industry and its concern to have secure access to forest resource. The Commonwealth will provide a legislative level of resource security for the sawmilling sector, provided it can form an enterprise to meet the eligibility criteria clearly specified in clauses 5 and 11 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the legislation for the sawmilling sector, the Government intends to provide non-legislative resource security for investments which do not meet the $100m threshold. The arrangements to be offered by the Commonwealth through formal Commonwealth-State agreements are similar to the provisions in the legislation in that they include comprehensive, up-front assessment and provisions to accommodate changing circumstances of an exceptional nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The type of project the Government envisages which could well use these arrangements is, for example, the hardwood sawmilling industry in the south east forests of New South Wales which at this stage cannot meet the $100m eligibility threshold. In this instance, the Commonwealth would require a number of provisions: that the enterprise must be willing to commit either to value adding investment or to industry restructuring; that the relevant State government must be prepared to offer a longer term, contractually based supply licence for sawlogs to enable the investment to proceed, such as has been the case in Victoria and Western Australia; and, thirdly, that the woodchip export company must have invested or be prepared to invest in other value adding activities in Australia, either in sawmilling enterprises or commercial plantations, and agree that domestic value adding of the woodchips has priority over their use for export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that the Commonwealth is involved in export licensing in the region concerned, it will offer a longer term export licence to the year 2000, and thereafter on a case by case basis, on the understanding that if the woodchips are required for domestic use then, subject to market consideration, they should be directed to that end. This should not detract from the Commonwealth's firm desire to achieve maximum domestic processing of woodchips by the year 2000 or soon thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to compensation, the Government believes that there are adequate provisions in the approaches outlined in the Bill to ensure that, even in the unlikely event of resource withdrawal, adequate resources would remain available for the projects. These provisions are outlined in clause 9 of the Bill, which authorises the Commonwealth to enter into an agreement with a State concerning the provision of resource security for a wood processing project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreements envisaged by the Government will include matters such as surety of wood supply in the event of resource withdrawal. Such agreements are to be legally binding. For instance, the catchment area for a project should be defined to include a margin for the protection of environmental values, and this would be specified in the</PARA>
<PARA>agreement between the Commonwealth and the State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Bill explicitly rules out liability by the Commonwealth or a State to pay financial compensation, it does not prevent the provision of structural adjustment assistance, such as the Government has provided in the past in cases involving World Heritage listings of the forests of south-west Tasmania, the north Queensland rainforests and, most recently, in response to the cessation of logging on Fraser Island. Furthermore, there is nothing in the legislation which would preclude a State agreeing to make available alternative resources of equivalent quantity, quality and price in the event of the withdrawal of resources due to unforeseen circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the combination of the legislated resource security for large projects, including integrated hardwood sawmilling projects and large-scale plantation programs, together with the framework of enhanced intergovernmental agreements for smaller-scale investments in the hardwood sawmilling industry, is an unprecedented package which delivers security and incentive for industry restructuring in an environmentally responsible framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all of those reasons, and based on what I have put in this closing debate to the Senate, the Government firmly believes that the legislation is sound public policy. The Government urges&mdash;and I ask the Opposition to hear this&mdash;the Opposition to reconsider the amendment and to support this legislation and its passage through this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's amendment has a number of features that recommend it to me. I wonder, though, whether it could not be adequately dealt with in the committee to which this Bill is going to be referred. My problem with it is that it indicates that the Bill should be withdrawn and introduced in an amended form. I do not see any reason to withdraw the Bill since it is going to a committee in any event and, as I understand it, is to be returned to this chamber not later than Thursday of next week. The Bill is here and, in my view, should not be withdrawn; we should persevere with attempts to improve the Bill in that committee and in the Committee of the Whole. Therefore, it is my intention not to vote for the amendment, but to vote for the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the final analysis, after all of the considerations are made by the committee, obviously one will have to consider this question in two ways.

Secondly, one is also here representing the State from which one is elected, in particular.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few helpful comments to improve understanding about the industrial relations situation concerning APPM. The position is that the company has notified the unions concerned and all its employees that it has withdrawn unilaterally from all over-award agreements. However, the fact is that it will still provide several of the over-award benefits which had previously been the subject of those agreements, but only to existing employees. It is not proposing that future employees be granted those benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was surprised to hear that APPM was so sensitive that it wanted the question of the conditions to be clarified. The fact is that it has given notice of withdrawal from all agreements. That was the term of the advise&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has withdrawn from the agreements. Certain of the benefits under those agreements are to be maintained for some employees. On 3 March the unions concerned and the employees were given very badly worded advice that the company:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">retires from all such agreements and/or arrangements with effect from 2 April 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please also be advised that site access for union officials will be granted by the company strictly in accordance with the Award effective from 3/3/1992.</PARA>
<PARA>The point is that there was no doubt whatsoever that the company had withdrawn from all agreements. It is acknowledged that several of the conditions within those agreements were to continue for existing employees. I hope that this sensitivity to that point is a sign that the company does not intend to act in as much of a Rambo fashion as at first thought. If that is so, if that is a signal, that is good. All I would ask of the company is that it agree to sit down and talk with the unions as the workers' representatives. The unions have been, over some time, acting quite reasonably in discussing work practices and so forth at APPM and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I asked a question during Question Time earlier in the week, I referred to the company as one which was seeking government assistance. That is true. The company was pushing for resource security legislation. I will not transgress by referring to the earlier debate, but that is a fact that I will mention in passing. The company wanted that legislation, it wanted ministerial intervention in relation to its loss of the Telecom phone book paper contract. The company argued that it needed to pull out of these over-award agreements because of its costs and its need to become more efficient. That is not necessarily something that anyone would disagree with. But there is a way of going about that that ought to be more reasonable than the unilateral and confrontationist way in which the company has approached this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the Telecom phone book paper contract, I am told that the comparative figures for wages for a person at the Wesley Vale plant is $510 compared to $560 at ANM for the same job. Yet ANM won an increased contract for Telecom paper at APPM's expense. The question of employee costs does not seem to add up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that this issue at APPM does not develop into a nasty dispute. There is the possibility of that happening. I am pleased that the President of the ACTU, Martin Ferguson, has become personally involved in dealing with this matter. The ACTU is obviously taking seriously what could be a nasty dispute. I believe the unions concerned are acting very responsibly. The Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, has certainly acted appropriately in asking the Industrial Relations Commission to regard the matter as one subject to the public interest in the hope that the employer would agree to sit down and discuss the sorts of things that are on its mind about work practices, costs and so forth. The problem is that, on the face of it, the company is being highly confrontationist about it. It is in the same stable as the Peko-Robe River mine. It was the North Broken Hill Peko company which caused so much trouble several years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important, for a clear understanding of this dispute, that it be acknowledged that there has been this apparently confrontationist and unilateral withdrawal from agreements which were long established. As I said earlier, several of the conditions are to continue for existing employees. That seems to be out of the goodness of the company's heart, not because it has been subject to the agreement. The company has decided that itself because it does not intend to deal further with the parties to those agreements, being the unions representing the employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the responses of the Government and the union have been reasonable. I hope that the sensitivity to the facts of the situation as exhibited today is a sign that maybe APPM, in its own interests as well as those of its employees,  will not press ahead with being confrontationist and unreasonable in its industrial relations stance from now on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like briefly to expand on and clarify some comments I made earlier on the report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Come in Cinderella: the Emergence of Adult and Community Education</EMPHASIS>. I commend the work of the inquiry. I believe that the senators made a very thorough investigation. People working in the area of adult and community education had high expectations of the inquiry, especially as the last review of this kind had been done in 1944. It has been conveyed to me that they were delighted with the report and would like to see it followed up in 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has been slow in recognising the value of educational programs which are made available to adults who have returned after long breaks from formal study. In particular, women have benefited from this and represent 75 per cent of the clientele of this educational facility. It is important to the quality of life of adults of all ages to have access to such opportunities. It will benefit the productivity of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been requested to stress the need for a well planned Commonwealth structure that is based on well formulated national policies. This would allow Australia to occupy its rightful place in international forums where previously no united national voice has been possible. This would augment the support already strongly emanating from local, regional and state resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier, I mentioned some concerns about the omission from this report of the importance of the adult education program to women. There is a very high level of participation on the part of women, as I have already mentioned, and the benefits gained by women are substantial. Nonetheless, the organisers and administrators in this educational sector are not adequately recompensed for their work and the majority of them are women. The reality is that women in work in the community are still disadvantaged in comparison to men when it comes to fair and reasonable access to learning opportunities in adult life. I conclude by saying that I endorse the enlightened approach to education that this sector offers to the community as a whole, and to women in particular. It recognises the lifelong value of education and its aim of preserving, cultivating and stimulating our growth as human beings. </PARA>

Senator Watson in his question did pursue me, to some extent, on whether or not there was in the company's statement an undertaking by it after the cancellation of the over-award agreements to maintain benefits for a 25 per cent over-award payment, a shorter working week where it currently applies, redundancy payments and superannuation arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I think is my responsibility, when I returned to my office I inquired of my Department as to the claims by Senator Watson which were, to large extent, borne out by the letters given to me by Senator Devereux as I was responding to the debate. I asked my Department, firstly, whether it is true that those matters were maintained despite the cancellation of the agreement by the company and, if it were true, why they were not included in my brief when I answered in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response has been that the Department was aware of those matters. The officers did not include them in the brief because they believed that the report, contained in the letters of the company to the unions, that the over-award agreements were cancelled, was in fact, on the plain face of it, true; that those agreements will not exist after the 30 days have expired; and that the then extension by the company of those four conditions was another matter again&mdash;another matter again which has been, I understand, in submissions before the commission and further modified to refer only to those current employees and not any new employees who would be engaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of that information which has now been passed to me and in response to the remarks that have been made, I think it is appropriate that I inform the Senate of that advice which I am now in receipt of and confirm that to the best of my knowledge that that is the case, that those provisions were&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The extent of post-tax changes to consumption and production decisions from hypothetical pre-tax positions depends on the own-price and the cross-price elasticities of demand and supply among all goods and services. This is a complex empirical question. Moreover, whether such effects are seen as distortions is in part a normative issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) One cannot be certain, because of the complicated empirical and normative issues mentioned in (1), whether a uniform rate of tax on all goods and services would increase national production or improve the operation of the market. A further consideration to be borne in mind is that uniformly taxing all goods and services has not been achieved in any jurisdiction, and the administration costs of such an approach would need to be offset against any possible allocative efficiency gains from more uniform taxation of a broader base. Further, important equity issues have to be weighed in designing any taxation structures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The existing sales tax can be expected to impact less heavily on services than on the production of those goods directly subject to sales tax, although a significant proportion of goods are exempt from sales tax. While the wholesale sales tax does not directly tax the output of the services sector, the service sector does bear the sales tax on any of its taxable inputs. As shown in Press Release No. P36 of 1 December 1991 by the then Treasurer, the contribution of the sales tax to the costs of service industries is typically of the same order of magnitude as for the goods-producing industries. Whether the resulting pattern of production is considered `supra' or `sub' optimal would depend on the complex empirical and normative issues noted above.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) At January 1992 there were some 44,100 war widow pensioners whose rate of Social Security pension was being paid at the rate payable before 1 November 1986.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) War widow pensioners with dependent children could, depending upon their private income and place of residence, receive a greater total amount of income support by surrendering their war widows pension and claiming sole parent pension in lieu, since the rate of Social Security guardian allowance ($28.70 per fortnight) exceeds the rate of Veterans' Affairs domestic allowance ($24.00 per fortnight) and sole parent pensioners may qualify for remote area allowance ($14.00 plus $7.00 per child per fortnight). War widows would need to have little or no other income above the Social Security income test free area to benefit from these arrangements. War widow pension is income-test-free. Although no information on numbers in this situation is available, total costs would be relatively small, especially since there are likely to be very few war widows with this combination of circumstances and war widow pensioners are free to seek Social Security payments if it is to their advantage. Most war widows are better off receiving war widow pension.</PARA>
