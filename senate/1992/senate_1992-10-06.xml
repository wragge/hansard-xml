<PARA>Mr Deputy President, as you will recall, the Senate found it necessary when we were last sitting to restrict Ministers in their answering of questions. That was not a procedure that we entered into without due consideration. The Senate had suffered constant abuse by Ministers of Question Time in that they had completely avoided their responsibility of answering questions and accounting for the administration of their portfolios. Rather they saw Question Time simply as an opportunity to get up and abuse the Opposition and the Opposition's program under the protection of the Chair for as long as they liked.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was necessary in those circumstances to take some action to restrict them to try to bring this abuse to an end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were aware, of course, that they had taken their instructions in this matter from the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and the way that he and his people behaved in the other place, where they see the whole of Question Time simply as an opportunity to bucket the Opposition rather than to accept any responsibility to account whatsoever. This place did not have that tradition. In this place Ministers traditionally made an attempt to answer questions and to account for their performance. We wanted to get that tradition back on deck and to overcome the abuses that had been occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The experiment was put in place for one week. Of course, that is not really long enough for it to be properly evaluated. The purpose of this motion is to allow a longer period, that is, three weeks in all. I think in the meantime the matter should perhaps go to the Procedure Committee and other such bodies for consideration also. But three weeks should be a period in which the Senate can make a proper appreciation of the effects of this reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, I thought I would give you a couple of examples of the public's reaction to this. The reaction from the public has been incredibly supportive. They are sick and tired of the abuse of Question Time, the abuse of the processes of this place and the abuse of Parliament itself. I will read just two letters to you. The first one was from the ACT, from a woman who said to me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I regularly watch the televising of Question Time and listen to the Parliament on radio. It was refreshing to be able to watch and listen to the Senate Question Time this week and find that questions were not only being answered succinctly but that a reasonable number of questions were also being asked. Question Time is at last being used correctly. Congratulations to those who thought of and instigated the new time requirements. I sincerely hope that it will continue to be kept in force and become mandatory for the House of Representatives also.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Opposition for that interruption. We, in fact, scored very well in the Victorian election on the weekend in the four seats in which we stood. I would like to put it on the record that the vote augurs extremely well for the coming Federal election. I invite the Opposition to actually have a look at those figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the substantive motion which is before us, we support in principle this idea of time limitation; we believe that it worked very well during the trial week. However, we did notice that there was one occasion on which Opposition senators were incapable of asking questions within one minute; we wonder whether they also need to be somewhat restricted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Noting that several Government Ministers who represent Ministers in the other House simply took questions on notice&mdash;despite the fact that they had been given some prior warning of those questions&mdash;we seek to amend the motion so that it would provide four minutes for answering the question in the first instance and two minutes for answering a supplementary question. In doing so, I invite those Ministers who represent Ministers in the other place to take questions seriously, because there is little point in asking a question if we do not get an answer to those questions, and that is exactly what happened during the last week of sitting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of the experience of that week, we would like to modify this process for a further fortnight. We believe we will get more information from a modified proposal and, given that change, there is a good chance that Government Ministers will indeed answer all the questions which are asked of them; that will lead to an improvement in Question Time, as outlined in the letters which Senator Hill read out. We certainly want question time and answer time very substantially improved. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We had some debate about this matter during the last sitting week so I will not repeat all the arguments for and against the substance of this proposal. There is much heat and not much light being shed in the debate. There were great fulminations by Senator Hill this afternoon; I am delighted he has found two people who want to write to him favourably. I hope that makes him feel much better, but it really does not add anything to the sum of human knowledge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that, in the long term, this mechanism we are putting in place is going to be a lasting reform that will survive. Nevertheless, we on this side of the House can do fairly rudimentary arithmetic and work out that more than half the Senate is going to vote for some sort of limit. Therefore, in that light, we will be supporting the amendment moved by the Democrats for time limits of four minutes and two minutes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of answering questions in a representative capacity is not a problem which I personally confront. I have not had a chance to consult with any of my colleagues about this matter because it has only just been raised, but I will discuss it with them before Question Time tomorrow. It is a matter which they may wish to act upon from tomorrow onwards if they so choose. I simply indicate, for the purpose of rounding the debate and shortening subsequent contributions, that when we have finished dealing with this motion, I will seek leave to move a motion relating to the debate on answers given to questions without notice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must confess my profound disappointment at the way in which the Democrats have approached this issue. One would have thought that their track record would suggest that they were particularly interested in getting as many answers as possible, in particular, answers of substance. Not one thing has been said to demonstrate that the two-week exercise that we had during the last sitting was in any way defective other than in respect of a matter which the Democrats raised, that is, a clear breach of the undertakings given by Ministers. They are well paid to answer questions not only directly but also in a representative capacity. They chose not to do that, in a childish tit for tat response, and I thought the Democrats could have recognised that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in every other respect what we achieved in that last fortnight was a dramatic reduction in the sort of nonsense that people go on with, such as filibustering or simply not answering the question, or `doing a Button', which involves stuttering and stammering and looking around for an interjection which one can then hang a 10-minute answer on. I would have thought, therefore, that what the Democrats ought to have done is to have given that experiment a fair chance, and indeed it has worked to about 90 per cent of expectations. There is only that one area where there has been a lack of bona fides on the part of those opposite and where I would have thought, with a little bit more flushing out, they could have been forced to accept responsibility for answering questions for which they do not have direct responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the Democrats have now reduced significantly the number of questions that will be answered in this chamber. Once again they have given those opposite the opportunity to go on with all the nonsense. There is nothing to suggest that two minutes is in any way inadequate to give an answer to a question. As the Democrats know, one can take as long as one wants; and if one gets a supplementary, one can do so twice. In every respect that procedure was capable of being made to work perfectly. Yet the Democrats, without giving us any warning&mdash;which I think is an indication of how serious they are about the whole exercise&mdash;have now provided a forum for the Government to fall back into the bad old ways. The Democrats ought to accept responsibility for that. Clearly, those on the Government benches will grab that opportunity with both hands because it gives them every chance to reduce the number of questions. The Democrats are responsible for that and I hope they will wear it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I strongly support the remarks of my colleagues Senator Hill and Senator Alston. It is interesting to note from the statistics going back to 1970 that in this chamber apparently every other government but the Hawke-Keating Government could average some 28 to 30</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>questions a day. That works out in the hour to an average length of answer of under two minutes. Ministers in this Government apparently cannot reach the standards of all previous governments on which we have been able to compile statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion that was moved in the last sitting week was an attempt to try to get the Government back to a reasonable standard of behaviour in relation to Question Time and to provide more questions and more time for those questions to be answered. The Australian Democrats today, in widening the ambit and length of time for answers, not only have taken us back to the position in which we were before this motion was moved but have created a climate for Question Time which is now worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community as a whole&mdash;and we have seen it in the debate in the other place&mdash;is demanding higher standards from the Parliament, and in particular in relation to Question Time. The Democrat response to this today has been to undermine the most significant reform of Question Times which has been put in place in the past decade or so. I seek leave, Mr Deputy President, to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a table which shows the numbers of questions answered and the number of supplementary questions raised and answered during the time the current experiment was in place. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, it is no wonder that Senator Hill received these letters. This was a major reform. It was a major improvement to Question Time and because&mdash;as Senator Alston said&mdash;a number of Ministers spat the dummy and said they would not answer their questions the Australian Democrats have totally buckled. They have undermined the most important reform to improve Question Time. Whatever private assurances, winks or nods that the Democrats have received from Government Ministers about them agreeing to this reform, they will find that in a fairly short period of time Question Time in this chamber will not only revert to the bad old days but will get worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have all noticed, we are now heading towards an election and this Government will use&mdash;as undoubtedly it is entitled and as we are entitled&mdash;every possible vehicle to get its views across. By allowing a Minister four minutes to answer a question&mdash;on average, four minutes to answer a question is a far longer time than all Ministers in previous governments took to answer questions&mdash;the rules will have been loosened to such an extent that Question Time will go back to the bad old days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to you, Mr Deputy President, that this is a disgraceful amendment which has been signalled by Senator Coulter and the Australian Democrats. I only hope his colleagues have more regard for the rights of this chamber and the rights of senators and will not support him in this. We have often heard from the Australian Democrats that they are of an independent mind and do not vote the party way. Senator Sowada, Senator Kernot and Senator Bourne will all now be tested as to whether they are prepared to undermine Question Time and follow their leader, Senator Coulter. This is a disgraceful proposal which has been raised by Senator Coulter. Question Time will revert to the bad old days, and I strongly oppose the amendment moved by Senator Coulter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is unfortunate that clear self-interest appears to have become the ultimate motive for the Australian Democrats in this debate. It is evident from the figures Senator Kemp has tabled that the Australian Democrats were getting two questions per day under the old arrangement and are getting two questions per day under the arrangement we intend to proceed with. The figures showed that in fact Government senators and Opposition senators had benefited from the opportunity to ask many more questions under the temporary arrangements which we hope to continue. In other words, the Australian Democrats' interest in this procedure bears no relationship to the benefit to the Parliament, but it does to their own self-interest exclusively.</PARA></TALK.START>

Then the Government got its act together and started to run phoney supplementaries and so on and we ended up with 28 questions being asked. But at least 28 questions were asked in the last two days of this system.

Let us recognise this: when only 16 questions and supplementaries were asked on 10 September, the crisis day that brought forward this change, the Democrats had two questions. In other words, they have not directly benefited.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the contrary, they may feel they have been perhaps put down a little because the amount of time taken by Government Ministers to respond to Democrat questions has fallen from 2.33 minutes per question to 1.27 minutes per question. Perhaps the Democrats are concerned that they are not being taken seriously enough by the Government. I have always thought Government Ministers were taking them far too seriously. If we in this chamber would recognise more the benefits to the Parliament of this change rather than focus on the very narrow, selfish, self-interest of the Australian Democrats, this chamber would proceed far more satisfactorily. I urge those members of the Australian Democrats who do have some concern for this place to vote in support of Senator Hill's motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to speak for the five minutes I am allotted; I simply want to make a number of comments. Some time ago, I think about seven years ago, former Senator Reg Withers said that the period of time in the day we call `Questions Without Notice' should be referred to as `Questions Without Answers'. From the time former Senator Withers first said that up until the last couple of weeks, the Government has taken that to an absolute art form. The Government used the time to avoid giving a proper answer to a simple question and to either advertise their own policies, which they could do in a ministerial statement, or simply try to do a bucket job on the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last fortnight we saw a change for the better. Ministers had to answer questions in an articulate fashion within two minutes and could have another two minutes to answer supplementary questions if their first answers were not adequate. Ministers with any real capacity, which divides some of those opposite anyway, and a reasonable ego can easily give an articulate answer in two minutes. Those two requirements&mdash;having a reasonable capacity and a limited ego&mdash;cut out a significant portion of those on the other side. Nonetheless, it is the case that someone with a decent capacity and a limit on his or her ego can answer articulately within the two-minute time frame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My third point is this: questions without notice are not for the benefit of the Government; they are for the benefit of those who want to question the Executive. Questions without notice are not for the benefit of Ministers to give answers. The whole purpose of Question Time is for us, the Australian Democrats and others on this side who might like to ask questions to ask them and get answers; it is not to suit Ministers&mdash;that is, it is for the benefit of the asker and not the answerer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the Democrats that it is not a question of whether a Minister wants four minutes to answer a question; it is a question of whether the person asking the question is happy with the answer that he or she gets in a two-minute time frame. If he or she is not happy with the answer given because that person thinks it is inadequate in some way, he or she can ask a supplementary question. Therefore, the Minister will have another two minutes to answer. That is how we should be looking at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are unhappy with the answers, we will ask supplementary questions&mdash;not give Ministers four minutes to begin with. If we give Ministers four minutes to begin with, we will have more of Senator Evans giving himself a buzz by practising his word skills and reminding himself how clever he is, Senator Cook yet again bumbling the reading of his briefs&mdash;he has displayed a manifest incapacity to answer questions without them&mdash;and Senator Collins displaying yet again his total incapacity to answer a question in two minutes because he misses out on the bad job that a four-minute answer would provide him with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons, we should stick with the two-minute time frame. In that way, we can ascertain who has any real capacity to answer a question articulately. We should leave it to the person asking the question to decide whether he or she wants more information or to ask a supplementary question, which will give more time to Ministers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could we just for a moment be a bit practical and even a little fair and reasonable? From my experience of the last sitting week, it is my view that two minutes is unfortunately too short for people to give answers. In the last sitting week when genuine questions of substance were asked&mdash;and I mean genuine questions of substance, which were often by the Australian Democrats&mdash;Ministers were genuinely unable to complete their answers within two minutes. Therefore, what did we see? We saw the novelty of all these artificial supplementary questions from the Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While talking of time taken up in Question Time, let us not forget the spurious points of order that are raised by the Opposition, 98 per cent of which are not upheld. Four minutes will eliminate artificial supplementaries and give the Minister a reasonable time to answer. Four minutes is totally reasonable. It is not compulsory; it is an option. I remind members of the Opposition that this motion is for a two-week trial. We are quite obviously evolving into some other form. In two weeks we can evaluate the situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is disappointing to hear that the Democrats have succumbed to pressure from the Government. I say that for the very simple reason that this proposed amendment will leave us in a worse situation than the one we were in prior to the alteration. The fact is that the new sessional order was brought in in a sense of desperation. It set a time limit of two minutes for answers given by the Government. The reason for that is amply displayed by analysis of the statistics. They clearly show that the very lengthy answers which the Government would indulge in were given in answer to dorothy dixers. They lasted for five minutes on average.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of the two-minute answer for a trial period of a week met with good response from the general public. This Question Time is meant to be part of the checks and balances of our system of government. It is meant to be a time when questions are asked of executive government and Ministers are meant to give answers as part of the scrutiny process. They are meant to be accountable for their actions. Too often again and again we saw clear examples of the dorothy dixer being used by a Minister to make a ministerial statement which, quite frankly, ought to be done at a different time in the agenda of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We agreed as a body to use for a period of one week the limitation of two minutes. By extending it to four minutes and two minutes we are reverting to a position which is worse than the situation we were in previously. We will have fewer and fewer questions and return to the abuse of Question Time&mdash;time that is used either to abuse the Opposition or to make a ministerial statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said it is disappointing to see that the Democrats have succumbed to pressure from the Government because there is no other rational reason for this amendment to take place. If they are honest in saying that we wanted to have a true trial, we would continue the trial that we put in place for one week for at least a fortnight to allow Ministers to get used to the new system whereby they have to be succinct and pertinent to the question asked. If that were to be the case, at the end of the day after a true trial the Democrats may say, `Let's discuss some slight modification'. But they simply want to go back to the old system&mdash;quite frankly, back to the bad old days. If the public is to be considered and properly served, we will reject the amendment of the Democrats and we will simply support, as Senator Chamarette has done, the substantive motion moved by Senator Hill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a matter of the Prime Minister changing his mind or changing his statement of policy in any way. It is simply a matter of clearly articulating Australia's priorities. Australia's priorities are, clearly, firstly, to achieve global trade liberalisation; secondly, to advance the cause of regional trade liberalisation in a manner not inconsistent with global liberalisation; and a long way down the list of the hierarchy of preferences for us is the pursuit of subregional or bilateral free trade arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We acknowledge that, in principle, such arrangements can constitute building blocs towards the establishment of those larger free trade areas or principles. But in practice there is a very real difficulty about making that assumption, particularly with bilateral arrangements in which the United States is a partner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this matter was given closer attention and, in particular, in the light of the extraordinarily embarrassing embrace that was directed towards the United States by the Leader of the Opposition in complete indifference to Australia's larger trade policy interests in the Asian region, and in particular with our northern neighbours, it became apparent that there really did need to be stated more firmly Australia's reservations about the down side risks of focusing too much attention on bilateral arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those risks, so far as Australia is concerned, can very simply be stated. In the first place, it is very difficult for us to be able to contemplate a bilateral trade arrangement with the United States in which the benefits to us would manifestly outweigh the costs. Secondly, any such arrangement, if multiplied between us and a number of other so-called spokes, with the United States as its hub, would be very likely to create not an ease in the trading environment but, in the first instance at least, a greater degree of difficulty in the trade patterns as between the United States partners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the third place, we would argue, and have argued very articulately through the Prime Minister, that to place the emphasis on a pattern of individual relationships like this with the United States rather than on the larger regional and global strategy is really to miss the basic point and to miss the real interests of the Australian economy and Australian exporters.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a matter of doing anything to attack the United States.

I was fortunate enough to be able to be present at that occasion and launched its new logo. The opening of business for the new Authority and the new Broadcasting Act, which took effect yesterday, mark the commencement of a new broadcasting regime in this country. The new regime is the result of an enormous amount of work to bring the 50-year-old Broadcasting Act of 1942 up to date and to provide us with a legislative framework which will take us into the next century.

It is also a further significant milestone in this Government's micro-economic reform agenda, which has already achieved landmark reforms in telecommunications, aviation, the national rail system and the waterfront. The new Act provides a framework for broadcasting regulation which can respond to future technological changes. The charter of the Broadcasting Authority is designed to provide for regulatory responsiveness to accommodate this change and, in doing so, to minimise regulatory intervention.</PARA>

It would have been very useful if the Bill that they had ready on Monday had been made available last week so that the electorate could scrutinise the actual contents of the legislation. They did not make it available, and I think that speaks for itself.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen the report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that Senator Crowley refers to, but I did see on television last night the State Minister for Health in New South Wales encouraging his Victorian colleague to try to sabotage the arrangements that are being foreshadowed as the subject of discussion with the Federal Minister for Health in a few weeks' time. Of course, that would be disastrous for the health of Australians. What is at stake is a revamping of Medicare so that there is a proper dealing with the insurance aspects of health care for all Australians. Also at stake is the whole question of comprehensive health care for Australians. I know that in my home State of Tasmania the rural health program will be a very important part of that particular overall health approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the Federal Government has said that $1.6 billion will be available for the State public hospital systems over the next five years under these Medicare arrangements. That is a considerable increase in funding to those institutions where Australians will want to seek care and hospital treatment rather than be dependent on the private hospital system, which is the idol of the Opposition parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will take $1.3 billion away from the public hospitals system and use it to subsidise private health insurance premiums. It will force people to take out private health insurance premiums in addition to the levy and their normal taxation payments in order to make some sort of health system available to Australians. That is quite incredible. In fact, we believe we are on the right track in saying that more money ought to be provided for the public hospitals system, which is greatly appreciated by most Australians seeking hospital care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the health Ministers in New South Wales and Victoria would be well advised to take advantage of the discussions concerning the revamped Medicare agreement that are to be initiated over the next few weeks. Should misfortune strike and the Opposition ever come into government, under its policies, 5 per cent will be slashed from the funds made available to the States, which means that less money will be available from the State treasuries to fund their public hospitals. There will be a deterioration in the public hospitals and less access to public hospital beds by ordinary Australians. Fear will drive those Australians to take out private health insurance. The Opposition's objective is that people fund the health care system through their contributions to the private health insurance premium system, or else the Opposition will subsidise it by taking money away from public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is extremely important that we remove people's fear that they will not have sufficient access to public hospitals.

That will be done under the new Medicare arrangements that are foreshadowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bet that the Liberal Ministers from around Australia will take advantage of that offer rather than leave themselves in the position where they might lose that 5 per cent funding to the States and therefore find themselves confronted with a real reduction in funding for public hospitals. That is something they will not want to face. I am quite sure that they will take up this offer and that the political posturing will soon come to an end.</PARA>

The agreement between the Commonwealth, Tasmania and Benders Pty Ltd allows for no further blasting at the quarry and all quarrying in the active quarry area to cease by the end of January 1993. It also allows for the preparation of a rehabilitation plan by the Commonwealth, taking into account Australia's obligations under the World Heritage Convention and the Tasmanian Environment Protection Act, having primary regard for the values of the World Heritage area and providing for the safety requirements as set out in the Tasmanian Mines Inspection Act.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It takes a rather perverse cast of mind to regard it as a retaliatory step when one takes into account, quite apart from anything else, the fact that it was on 2 September, well before the Prime Minister's visit to Japan, that the basic EEP allocation of 29 million tonnes of wheat was announced. As part of that, India was specifically designated as a target market, as indeed was Pakistan, with a sum of 1.5 million tonnes of wheat being identified alongside India in that respect. That is something that obviously gave us cause for concern at the time when the sales were merely in prospect. Obviously, we have even more concern now that those sales have been announced. But it cannot be argued to have been something totally unforeseen, unanticipated and unexpected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not make it any easier to accommodate, the decision now having been made, first with Pakistan and now with India, particularly since there simply is no evidence of which we are aware or which has been put in the public domain, or even in the private domain, by the US indicating that there was actually EC activity in this Indian market. There was alleged to be a prospective EC activity in Pakistan&mdash;and I presume the same point would be made in this case&mdash;but there certainly is no actual activity going on.

But certainly there is legitimate ground for anxiety and for concern about that. I express that concern now, as I have done publicly already&mdash;others have done so in prospect before&mdash;and as we must continue to do. The difficulty is that the motivation clearly of this sale is far more to do in the present environment with politics in the United States than good trade policy or even legitimate counterassaults on the EC to bring to a head the battle we are all familiar with about export subsidies in the context of international trade generally.</PARA>

But there has certainly been some wheat to be sold there this year and there is no evidence that the EC has been in there with subsidised wheat.

Secondly, was this submission in conformity with the published minimum requirements for 200 hotel rooms in the Treasury casino project, and did it involve a complete gutting of the Treasury building so that only the bare facades of this National Estate registered building would remain? Thirdly, did Jupiters, in the knowledge that the IDC would grant a concessionary reduction of 50 in the number of rooms required for the hotel, prepare a second non-conforming tender concurrently with their conforming tender&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1142" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The program that the SBS is progressing is on track. SBS is Australia's outstanding multicultural broadcaster. It does have a charter to provide multilingual and multicultural broadcasting services which inform, educate and entertain all Australians and, in so doing, reflect Australia's multicultural society. The Government is fully committed to the SBS, and in 1991 enacted legislation that established the SBS as an independent corporation and guaranteed its independence in regard to both programming and its activities. As well, the Government has guaranteed the SBS a base funding level maintained in real terms. Under the triennial funding agreement the SBS receives funding fully adjusted for inflation and as well is exempted from the 1.25 per cent efficiency dividend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989 the then Minister announced a program to extend the coverage of SBS television. As well as being available in all State capital cities and Canberra, the program announced in 1989 has seen the extension of SBS to the Latrobe Valley, Bendigo and Ballarat. Later this year SBS TV will be available on the Darling Downs. Next year will see the extension to the Spencer Gulf, Darwin and north-east Tasmania, followed by Cairns and Townsville in 1994. Funds have been committed already for this extension</PARA>
<PARA>program and planning and work are progressing well. Indeed, I know that the transmitters and antennas for the SBS service in Darwin have been ordered from NEC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of a 10 per cent cut to SBS funding causes great concern among those&mdash;and there are many&mdash;who enjoy and benefit from a range of services provided by SBS. In terms of actually giving specific detail about the impact of a 10 per cent cut on an organisation that already has a fairly small budget, Mr Brian Johns, who formerly headed that organisation, said publicly just recently that if one took just one particular component of the organisation's operations it would completely remove, for example, all Australian production from SBS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So a cut of this sort, which certainly the Opposition has announced across the board&mdash;although it has not provided any detail of how the cuts would be made&mdash;would put SBS expansion, which is currently ongoing, in great jeopardy.

I wish to add to the answers I gave on those occasions. On 15 September, Senator Walters tabled a statutory declaration by one of the joint venture partners attesting to various negotiations and some disputation between the company and the Waterside Workers Federation over the handling of cargo for the joint venture vessels at Hobart.

I was suggesting that no doubt there were a number of factors associated with the overall commercial standing of the Tasmanian joint venture which were relevant to the decisions not to proceed. The difficulty in resolving the industrial relations issues may not have been the sole reason for withdrawal of the project from Tasmania.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Calvert asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, upon notice, on 14 September 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Did the former Minister for Resources, Senator Cook give the owner of the southern Tasmanian Benders limestone quarry an official and conclusive assurance in a letter dated 18 August 1988 that the Government had no objection to the continued operation of the Quarry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) On the basis that such an assurance was given, has the decision to close the Quarry been nothing more than further evidence that the Government simply cannot be trusted in any consultation or negotiation and that even a written agreement with this Government such as the Cook/Groom Agreement of November 1988 is not worth the paper it is written on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) If the Minister is prepared to defend his Government's record, will he give an assurance that the Quarry owner, Mr Ray Bender will receive compensation as specified in Clause 16 of the 1988 Cook/Groom Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Finally, why did the Government conduct meaningless discussions with the Tasmanian State Government on the so called future of the Quarry with the knowledge that it had already arranged for the Proclamation closing the Quarry to be signed secretly by the Governor-General some three weeks before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins&mdash;The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes, the letter was prepared on the basis of knowledge of operations of the Quarry at that time. Senator Cook also stated that, `both the Commonwealth and the State would need to be consulted were there any proposals to extend the boundaries of your operation'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The decision to curtail quarrying at Benders Quarry was based on conclusions reached by two studies commissioned by the Tasmanian Department of Parks, Wildlife and Heritage, Environment and Planning and the Forestry Commission. The Kiernan Report of November 1991 was commissioned to determine the relationship between the Exit Cave karst drainage system and the existing and proposed future boundaries of Benders Quarry. The Tasmanian Department of Environment and Planning undertook an Assessment Report in January 1992 on Benders Pty Ltd proposal for future operations and extensions at the Quarry. Both reports concluded that continued quarrying operations at Benders Quarry are likely to damage the World Heritage values of the Ida Bay karst system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Legal advice available to me concludes that there is no legal obligation for the Commonwealth to pay compensation under Clause 16 of the Cook/Groom Agreement. Given the express terms of the Agreement, there may be a political commitment to assist Benders Pty Ltd for any closure or relocation. Accordingly, the Commonwealth has offered to negotiate with Benders Pty Ltd an ex-gratia payment for closure of the Quarry of an amount not exceeding the Commonwealth relocation and redundancy offer to Tasmania of $476,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Commonwealth had undertaken discussions and corresponded with the Tasmanian Government on the cessation of quarrying since February 1992. The Prime Minister indicated in a letter of 15 July 1992 to Premier Groom that should the Commonwealth financial offer for relocation of the Quarry continue to prove unacceptable, the Commonwealth would forthwith move by Regulations under the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act to prohibit quarrying. Premier Groom had previously advised at a Tasmanian World Heritage Ministerial Council meeting on 8 July 1992 that the Commonwealth financial offer was unacceptable. The Commonwealth received advice in late July that Benders Pty Ltd was drilling holes in preparation for blasting. As the Prime Minister had not received a reply to his letter of 15 July 1992, a Proclamation was signed at a regular Executive Council meeting on 3 August 1992. The Commonwealth was mindful of the need to take prompt action, if required, to protect the World Heritage values of Exit Cave. Although the Proclamation was signed on 3 August 1992 it did not come into operation until 19 August 1992 after further correspondence and negotiations with Tasmania and written advice from Premier Groom on 18 August 1992 that his Government was not prepared to plan for relocation of the Quarry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On that issue, it looks as though we may have a situation which is acceptable to the coalition. We then come to the proposition that each senator be restricted to speaking for four minutes in taking note of a Minister's answer. We had considerable debate on this matter the last time the issue was raised. The situation has since changed. The Government did agree to an amendment by the coalition that the original proposal for two minutes be extended to four minutes. We welcomed that, although at the time we made the point that that was far too short a period of time for consideration of answers that had been given previously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, we have the Government sticking with the four-minute proposal despite the fact that we have increased the amount of time that Government Ministers will have to answer questions from four minutes to six minutes. In other words, we have increased the period of time which the Government has available to it to answer questions by 50 per cent&mdash;from four minutes to six minutes&mdash;yet there is no provision for that to be reflected in the time that Opposition senators can have to take note of those answers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the coalition, I say to the Government that four minutes is a totally unrealistic and unreasonable amount of time. I propose to move that the period of four minutes referred to in the Government's motion be omitted and that it be substituted with a period of six minutes. If Senator McMullan wants to be even Steven with where we were during the week we tried this, I am trying to get the same situation relative to that which we had last time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third condition that the Government has imposed is that the total amount of time in which to take note of answers be restricted to 30 minutes. We argued this point in some detail when the matter was considered three weeks ago. At that time the coalition moved an amendment to substitute 60 minutes for 30 minutes. I will not go into all the arguments for that amendment again; they are set out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> debates of 15 and 16 September. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I remind honourable senators that if those opposite restrict the total time in which to take note of answers to questions to 30 minutes they are in effect saying that there will be no time to consider answers to probably more than one-third or one-quarter of the answers that have been given during Question Time. That is a major restriction. The coalition cannot accept that proposition. On behalf of the coalition, I propose to move an amendment that the period of 30 minutes be omitted from Senator McMullan's motion and that the period of 60 minutes be substituted. The coalition can accept the fourth point in Senator McMullan's motion, namely, that the time taken for points of order will be omitted from the total time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I very much hope the Democrats are persuaded by the experience of the trial held in the last week of sittings. It was a very successful trial. I hope the Democrats are persuaded by the arguments that we put at that time, and which we are repeating today, for an extension of the time in which each senator can speak in taking note of an answer from four minutes to six minutes and for an extension of the total time from 30 minutes to 60 minutes. Those are very worthwhile and very necessary amendments to Senator McMullan's motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attitudes and actions of the Democrats on the last occasion this matter arose and their performance earlier today when they moved an amendment to Senator Hill's motion&mdash;which, in effect, has very largely wrecked the efficient operating procedures that we had developed in the last sitting week&mdash;has shown them once again as being no more than compliant servants of this Government. Therefore, I do not have too much optimism that the logic of the points I am making will be reflected in the response of the Democrats, but I continue to live in hope. No doubt some of my colleagues may wish to comment on what Senator Coulter on behalf of the Democrats may have to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was the case the last time we dealt with this issue, we believe the amendments which I propose to move are very important. If we are really serious about having an efficient procedure for Question Time and for taking note of answers and if we are to have a fair and equitable system, the Senate really has no option but to adopt the amendments to Senator McMullan's motion. I hope commonsense will prevail. If honourable senators on both sides of the chamber are really serious about wanting to have the parliamentary institution operate efficiently, effectively and equitably, the coalition's amendments will be adopted. I seek leave to move my amendments together. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we have only just concluded Question Time, it is really quite remarkable that the empirical evidence which is before our eyes is not taken into account by Senator Short. Only a few moments ago he said that the amendments which we moved earlier to extend the time for answers to questions during Question Time from two minutes to four minutes wrecked Question Time. A quick tally of the Question Time we have just completed indicates that there were 21 questions and supplementaries at an average time of two minutes and 19 seconds. Moreover, as I recall, Ministers gave answers to all the questions and we did not have the ridiculous situation in which Ministers were simply taking questions on notice. Far from wrecking Question Time, the session today worked extremely well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier when we were debating this matter the Opposition was attempting to say that a trial period of one week was insufficient and it wanted a further two weeks in which to continue with the system exactly as it was so that we would get reliable data on which we could judge its effectiveness. The same argument applied in this instance would mean that we would remain with the time of half an hour for taking note of answers. As I recall, during that week the time limit of four minutes for each speaker in taking note of answers was quite adequate: it allowed eight speakers within the half hour, even if every speaker took his or her full time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Now, with 21 questions and supplementaries, that should be adequate time for people to take note and for Ministers to make response, if necessary. For precisely the same reason that the Opposition was arguing earlier&mdash;namely, that the same system should apply for the three weeks so that we can get a good handle on how well it is working&mdash;we believe that the system should continue as it was in that week, and therefore we would stay with the motion as originally moved by Senator McMullan. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the logic just displayed by Senator Coulter explains why the Democrats got only 3 per cent in the Victorian election. We have heard a man who claims to be intelligent say that he is allowing the Government to have its way by leaving unchanged the time limit for comments on motions to take note of a Minister's answer because we need three weeks to test that&mdash;but one week was enough to know that two minutes was too short for Ministers to answer questions, with another two for supplementaries; that is, four minutes. That is simply evidence that he belongs, lock, stock and barrel, to the Government&mdash;and no doubt we will in time find out what the price of that was.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they clearly do. What is the purpose of taking note of an answer during Question Time? Why is the practice used and provided for? The answer is, normally, that the answer given by the Minister either is misleading to the public and needs to be dealt with then and there and that 24 hours is too long to go by; or that while the issue is top of mind, while the issue is hot, as it were, it is necessary to set the record straight and to have fair debate on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take a look at some of the issues that have been raised in taking note of an answer, we see things like the Marshall Islands affair; we see things like the questions relating to Ambassador Butler; we see a whole range of issues where it takes longer than the four minutes which are permitted in order to have a full airing of the facts and figures that surround the answer given by the Minister on that day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any reading of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will show that the proper spirit of debate is evidenced in the procedure of taking note of the Minister's answer. There is a fair exchange while people are thinking of the issues; they are not contrived; somebody has not sat down for two hours out in an office and written out a speech&mdash;which is supposed to be against our Standing Orders&mdash;as the Democrats do on so many occasions. They are the worst offenders. They stand here and read a prepared text on some issue, whereas if they were asked to speak to it in a spontaneous manner they probably could muster only one minute. I am trying to say that putting a limit on Question Time is the same as putting a limit on that necessary procedure for taking note of an answer given at Question Time; and, to my mind, they should not be tied one to the other at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we put a time limit on the amount of time that a Minister may take for answering a question is very simply that we were seeing an abuse of process. Question Time is meant to be a time when the Executive is accountable. Time and again we would see a dorothy dixer given to a Minister to propound Opposition policy or to make a statement about something that he wanted to get down without using a proper statement by the Minister&mdash;probably too much trouble was involved to do it properly and get it circulated so there could be proper debate on it. So we use the properly provided for ability to take note of an answer&mdash;or the pseudo-statement, dare I say, in many cases&mdash;so that debate can ensue immediately the Minister has made those statements. There is no relationship at all between the amount of time that ought to be available to debate an important statement that has been made during Question Time and the simple time taken to ask a question and for the initial answer to be given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I find this whole debate rather spurious and contrived, but on the last occasion we in the Opposition did agree that we would accept the four-minute level when the two-minute response time was available for Ministers to answer both times&mdash;both on the answer and on the supplementary. But for the Democrats to now turn around and say, `Oh, well, you can have only four minutes to take note' when four minutes of answer has just been given just shows what a charade their independence is. It is non-existent. As I said, no doubt time will tell what sort of a deal has been done in order to get the Democrats to agree to what amounts to a gagging of free speech in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already seen the double-speak of the Minister for incompetence, otherwise known as Minister Bolkus, in his handling of the banning of free speech. When the High Court rules him down and says, `You are not allowed to taken freedom of speech away from Australians', what does he say? He says, `Terrific, I really love that judgment'. My goodness&mdash;the Minister for incompetence! That is the sort of thing that should be debated here again and again, and it will be in the MPI this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can get very angry at the way the Government chooses to abuse the processes of this Parliament. Anything that does not suit the Executive's convenience somehow has to be struck down. But the truth of the matter is that it can only be struck down with the concurrence of the Democrats. It looks like they have achieved it again&mdash;and they cannot even be bothered to sit here and support Senator Coulter's arguments. As I said, the illogicality of what Senator Coulter had to say in his five-minute contribution surely shows why the Democrats are in decline, why Senator Powell left them and why they got only 3 per cent of the vote in the Victorian election. </PARA>

<PARA> has happened today; it is of quite some significance. There was a deliberate effort by the Senate to improve the quality of Question Time. We ascertained&mdash;and I think the public would agree&mdash;that the central problem with Question Time was the very long and abusive answers that Ministers gave. As a result, the Senate moved to limit the time which Ministers could take to answer questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not an onerous limit. It had the effect, as we have seen from the four days over which the experiment took place, that the numbers of questions, including supplementaries, were: 34 on the first day, 34 on the second day, and 28 on the third and fourth days. What we saw during that time was quite an increase in the number of people on this side of the chamber putting questions to Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats then decided that this experiment, which was widely praised and which substantially lifted the number of questions to the average level that every other government has achieved since 1970, had failed after four days. Senator Coulter of the Australian Democrats had the cheek to get up today and say, `Well, it worked today'. The trouble with Senator Coulter and his colleagues is that they never do the required research.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That figure is a bit inflated because there are a number of Question Times in which we expanded the length of Question Time and, of course, it incorporates those four days where we lifted the average very substantially. What that shows is that we are absolutely back to where we were, because today Senator Coulter got up very proudly and said that Question Time was not destroyed because 21 questions were asked and answered. That is exactly what it was like before the new rules were brought in. In one hit Senator Coulter has taken Question Time, which had this remarkable improvement&mdash;an improvement which was welcomed by virtually all observers, with the exception of the people on the other side of the chamber&mdash;back to the bad old days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast to some earlier weeks, I think the Government was remarkably disciplined today. Having won this magnificent coup from Senator Coulter, having fooled the Democrats and got their agreement to take Question Time back to the bad old days, Government senators were pretty sensible today. They said, `We will be fairly disciplined'. `Fairly disciplined' means merely answering the same number of questions which they have answered on average for the whole year. It certainly was not their worst day. That is what Senator Coulter has done. With this simple action of his, he has really destroyed after only four days the major initiative of this chamber in decades to improve the quality of Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we come to the next issue. The next major initiative that was taken to try to improve the quality of debate in this chamber, and to try to make Ministers more accountable, was the procedure taken to take note of an answer after Question Time. Again, that was a very important initiative by the Senate chamber in which the real debates could properly occur and Ministers had to stay behind and answer for their administration and account for the answers that they gave in Question Time. There was nothing contrived about taking note of an answer. It was not like the formalised matter of public importance procedure. By and large, it was a very genuine debate; an attempt to make Ministers more accountable to the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did Senator Coulter do faced with the next major initiative that was taken? Again he bought the Government's line that the rights of senators should be limited to question and debate the answers that Government Ministers gave. Why Senator Coulter did that is beyond belief to me. I understood that one of the Democrats' major reasons for being here&mdash;their raison d'etre&mdash;was to try to make governments more honest and more accountable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this new procedure&mdash;which I believe was working remarkably well and which, by and large, was not used every day, but was regularly used&mdash;the quality of debates which ensued during that period were of value to this chamber and certainly of value to the public at large. Again, Senator Coulter has moved to reduce this major initiative taken by the Senate to make the Executive more accountable. I wait anxiously to hear how any other Democrat can come into this debate. Senator Bourne is in the chamber now and presumably she will vote for this rule. I will be fascinated to hear from her just how this particular initiative will improve the quality of debate and the accountability of Government Ministers in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn to the link which Senator Bishop said she could not quite see; I fully agree. I find the link between Question Time and taking note, and the need to relate the times involved one to the other, as somewhat spurious. The thing which really persuaded Senator Coulter last time was that somehow we had to go to a four-minute limit on the contribution that senators could make in taking note, because Ministers in Question Time were limited to four minutes. If Senator Coulter and Senator Bourne go back to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and we look forward to Senator Bourne's contribution&mdash;they will see that that was the linkage from which they then derived this rule that somehow we should limit senators to four minutes. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Loosley on this day, relating to Bangladesh.</PARA>
<PARA>As the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, made clear in his response to my question, the circumstances which confront the people of the Chittagong Hill Tracts region of Bangladesh have not attracted great publicity in Australia to date, either within our political circles or in terms of the media coverage of foreign affairs. I hope that situation changes, for the circumstances to which I allude deserve far greater attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are really talking about very serious human rights concerns that are both legitimate and immediate, and ones which I am pleased to be able to say, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has made clear, have been taken up by Australia through our High Commission in Dhaka. Indeed, it is fair to say that the Australian Government has been particularly diligent in this area, as we have been of recent times in neighbouring Burma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Foreign Minister made abundantly clear, the Bangladeshi security forces have been less than exemplary in the maintenance of peace in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. There have been abuses and very definite identifiable violations of human rights. This is a continuing problem, hence my reason for raising it this afternoon in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would be aware, Bangladesh is a country that is heavily dependent upon foreign aid for basic services and infrastructure. In this regard, it is reasonable to expect that there will be respect for human rights within Bangladesh as a precondition for the continuing flow of foreign aid. It is quite reasonable for this Parliament to make a linkage between respect for human rights and the continuing flow of Australian aid and Australia's continuing support for participation by Bangladesh within the international aid community and with international aid agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are entitled to expect better behaviour on the part of the Government of Bangladesh and the security forces of Bangladesh in respect of the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The security forces ought to be able to guarantee rather than threaten the security of the people of the Tracts. Australia's focus on human rights in our region is both established and enduring. It has been effective as our diplomacy has been effective in recent times in the region, examples including APEC and the Cambodian peace process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that a foreign policy which is devoid of human rights concerns is a foreign policy so sterile as to be devoid of both values and decency. Australian foreign policy is based on principles of both national interest and international obligation incorporating concern for fundamental human rights. In that regard it is worthy of endorsement and support, including the concerns expressed today in the Parliament over the circumstances that apply in Bangladesh. </PARA>

The Australian Democrats&mdash;the left wing socialists who go around beating their breasts about the freedom and rights of individuals&mdash;were about to agree to support a Bill to ban political advertising in this country. If it had not been for the campaign waged by the Liberal and National parties, by radio stations and, I might say, by the print media, which had nothing to gain, that is what would have happened. At that time the television stations were not as outgoing, presumably because of rumours that were floating around all over the place that there would be retribution by this Government if they did so. That is the sort of caper, these are the sorts of standover tactics, that this Government is on about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties made it abundantly clear that we would never ever accept this outrageous attack on freedom of speech or political expression but that we would accept disclosure provided that all parties were treated equitably. There were two aspects to the Bill. The Minister thought he was being pretty clever. He put those two aspects together and said, `What we are really trying to do is ban advertising; but what we are really after is disclosure. We will embarrass the Opposition because the Opposition will not support the disclosure requirements'. The rug was pulled right from under them. No matter what the bleatings of Senator Bolkus and the Government were, the Opposition stated categorically that we would support disclosure provided it was fair and equitable. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, wrote to the then Prime Minister and requested that the Bill be split. In other words, he was saying, `Look, we will support disclosure provided it is fair and equitable but never will we support this ban, this attack, on freedom of speech'. This request by Dr Hewson was rejected by the Labor Government. The then Prime Minister was quoted as saying&mdash;honourable senators opposite ought to remember these words because the High Court has taken a different view&mdash;`Let's teach the kid a lesson'. That is what the then Prime Minister said at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister, quite improperly in my view, hired outside consultancies to keep track of any immediate comments by me and my colleagues such as Senator Kemp and Senator Olsen when he was here. He actually used taxpayers' money&mdash;not a few thousand dollars but some hundreds of thousands of dollars&mdash;for his own political purposes in order to muzzle the Australian public. As I have said, this was quite an improper use of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of the legislation was twofold and blatantly transparent. The Federal Labor Party was broke and the Labor Government, like its collapsed counterparts&mdash;let us never forget this&mdash;in Russia and Eastern Europe, was prepared to do anything it could to limit criticism of its own past performances: a key reason why it imposed this outrageous legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Labor Party was concerned that its past performance would be brought to light either during or before an election campaign by the Liberal Party, the National Party or any other third party. What was and is that performance even today? Because there are numerous examples of that performance, it is impossible to go through the lot. One of the major performances about which the Labor Party can hang its head is the fact that it has consigned over one million Australians to the unemployment scrap heap with no light at the end of the tunnel. What a way for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to `teach the kid a lesson'! That is all he could say: `Let us teach the kid a lesson'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been claimed that the view of the general public was somewhat apathetic. There is a degree of truth in that, but it has always been my belief that the major reason for this apathy was that no Australian citizen could believe that any government would even contemplate bringing in legislation that would remove or limit his or her freedom the way this legislation did. When Senator Olsen, Senator Kemp and myself were going around Australia talking to people, we found them incredulous. The opinion that was coming through was, `We don't believe they will do that'; yet there it was within the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister claimed that his underlying purpose in bringing forward the legislation was to avert the potential for future corruption.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties called for a Senate select committee inquiry during the 1991 winter recess because we were so concerned about the effect the Bill would have on freedom of speech. This attempt was rejected. In fact, I moved a notice of motion in this place before the winter recess to refer this Bill to a committee. It was rejected by the Labor Party and, I might say, the Democrats, who should hang their heads in shame over this whole sorry episode. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The confident attitude of the Minister and the reaction we had from discussions with the Democrats were such that it was plainly obvious that a deal, a compromise, call it whatever one likes, had been made. Because we expressed that concern, people in society who until that stage had supported the Democrats also expressed concern. That was one of the reasons why Senator Powell found herself `a talking head', if I might use that expression which came out of the legislation, and lost her political head to Senator Coulter. The expectation then was that that having occurred maybe, just maybe, the Democrats would go back to accepting their responsibilities and acting on behalf of those people in Australia who treasure their freedom and democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties held their own inquiry, and I would particularly like to pay tribute to ex-Senator John Olsen who was given the task of chairing that inquiry. All those who gave evidence and those who contributed&mdash;from the Human Rights Commissioner, Brian Burdekin, Professor Flint of the Press Council, Professors Alston, Zines, Walker, Gilbert, Henningham and a host of others&mdash;were implacably opposed in their evidence to the attack on free speech in this particular legislation. Out of it came the question as to whether the Bill, if enacted, would be constitutional. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about this briefly. In answer to my question today in the Senate, Senator Bolkus said that no-one would have imagined that freedom of speech would have been accepted by the High Court as a way of invalidating this Bill. He also went on to say that nowhere in debate was constitutional validity raised. Nothing could be further from the truth. It was out of that committee and at a public hearing in this very place that Professor Alston said he thought there were constitutional problems. Subsequently, Professor Zines also came out and said there were constitutional problems. This was ignored by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eventually, we did get a select committee and, again, the evidence overwhelmingly was against the contents of this Bill. This did not faze, however, the Labor members of the Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures and, of course, they supported the Bill; thus in the process making a farce of these types of inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill, when debated, resulted in the longest continuous sitting of the Senate since 1964. It was not an engineered filibuster. Those who spoke on the coalition side were genuinely concerned about this atrocious legislation. It was then up to the New South Wales Government and the television stations to take the matter to the High Court. Its decision is a landmark decision as it held that the broadcast ban was invalid because it attacked the doctrine of representative government. That is the reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most extraordinary response&mdash;breathtaking in its sheer hypocrisy&mdash;came from the Minister. Here was a Minister who with the support of his Executive, the Labor Caucus and the Democrats, had connived to limit the freedom of political expression in Australia. He failed because of the High Court decision. He then had the temerity and audacity to claim it as a victory for freedom of speech in Australia. What an extraordinary statement! The hypocrisy is totally and utterly breathtaking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To claim that the decision is broader than the doctrine of representative government is drawing a long bow and is a mechanism which the Minister has attempted to use to save face. It is a story which the media has not swallowed. In my reading of the judgment, it was apparent that the Chief Justice went to some lengths to quarantine the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One senior Minister was quoted as saying, `Nick should not have to carry the burden of the High Court on his own', and I agree. The burden of this embarrassing defeat should be shared. Bob Hogg, who initiated the legislation, the Prime Minister, the Labor Executive, the Labor Caucus and the Democrats are the crowd who connived to attack a basic freedom in Australia which is the cornerstone of our democracy. It is the same crowd who have been responsible for record interest rates, record bankruptcies and record unemployment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of yesterday which probably sums up the situation we are in, and not without a touch of irony. Anne Flahvine, who is a legal reporter, Sydney based journalist and law graduate, starts off a feature piece with these three paragraphs :</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Lionel Murphy were alive today, he'd be entitled to a wry smile. For years, Murphy was a lone voice on the High Court arguing that fundamental rights&mdash;including the right of free speech&mdash;could be implied from the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just one hour before he died in 1986, Murphy's judicial colleagues sounded what was thought to be the death knell to this argument when they rejected out of hand the submission that there was an implied constitutional guarantee of freedom of communication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Six years later, they've changed their minds. And not only in relation to free speech.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a touch of irony here. Some six years and a few months ago I spent some time with Lionel Murphy. One of the issues that we discussed, as he was being chased off the High Court, was this very issue. We shared a frustration that the concept that he was pursuing at the time was not getting support, was not being accepted. So there is irony in the fact that, some six years later, the High Court has now chosen to basically embrace the philosophy of Justice Murphy in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some basic propositions in this debate&mdash;as I say, the sands have changed&mdash;that need to be placed on the record at the start. Firstly, there is one party in this Parliament that has been concerned with human rights. Secondly, there is one party in this Parliament that has been consistently opposed to human rights. Thirdly, this Government acted in accordance with international responses to this problem. Fourthly, the High Court surprised everybody. Senator Parer may drag out bits and pieces now, but former Premier Greiner, when launching the challenge and when asked about its chances, said in pretty straight terms, `It's a punter's chance&mdash;probably odds against'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept of freedom of political communication which has been embraced by the High Court was nowhere near the lips of anyone in the debate at that time or previous to it. There is another basic proposition in this debate. Basically, a concept of rights in the Constitution is something that those on the other side has not wanted. It will come back to bite them at some stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Peter Costello, the shadow Attorney-General, has made comments in recent days which indicate that he, at least, understands the dimension of the High Court decision. Although I do not agree with those comments&mdash;I will go to them later&mdash;I think it is fairly well balanced to say that a High Court acting in this way offers major challenges to the sort of legislation that Hewson and Howard, for instance, would want to implement in the industrial relations area. It offers huge problems in terms of any agenda that the Opposition may want to put in place. In essence, the Opposition may have won a particular battle but a long fought out war about a Bill of Rights is something that it has not won. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a surprising decision. The result surprised a number of people. But the underlying thinking of the High Court, and the underlying philosophy and principles adopted by the judges&mdash;no matter which judge one is talking about&mdash;are fairly well described as a fundamental shift in High Court direction on this issue.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, Nick Greiner at the time said it was a punter's chance&mdash;odds against. For some five years while this issue was debated in this place, in the House of Representatives, in the community and through two committees, the concept of freedom of political communication was never mentioned. So it was surprising in that sense as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also surprising in terms of international comparisons. Justice Brennan, on pages 35 and 36 of his judgment, goes through some of those international comparisons. He says on page 35:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the countries which ban paid political advertising during election times have constitutions guaranteeing the right to freedom of expression.</PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to quite accurately document the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. He refers to the European Commission of Human Rights on page 35 in his judgment where it held:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the freedom guaranteed by Art. 10&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is freedom of expression&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"cannot be taken to include a general and unfettered right for any private citizen or organisation to have access to broadcasting time on radio and television in order to forward its opinion". It held that the recognition of a State's power to license broadcasting and television permitted the granting of licences which excluded political advertising.</PARA>
<PARA>So as well as all those points I have made about there having been a surprise to us in this process, there have been international definitions of freedom of expression which have allowed for interventions and intrusions into the general concept of freedom of expression. Justice Brennan goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It can hardly be doubted that reduction in the cost of effective participation in an election campaign reduces one of the chief impediments to political democracy.</PARA>
<PARA>If one needed more information in terms of international comparisons, he cites the United Kingdom, where there is a ban on buying advertising time on radio and TV. In defending that ban, in about 1971 the UK Government advised the European Commission of Human Rights that the ban:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . served `to prevent the exponents of political views with the longest purse&mdash;whoever these may be&mdash;from having an advantage in terms of buying time on television to promote their cause'. If the clause did not exist, less well endowed parties or movements would have great difficulty in maintaining their point of view in the fact of massive purchase of advertising time by their opponents.</PARA>
<PARA>So it is a surprising new concept, one not anticipated even by the then Premier of New South Wales, Nick Greiner, at the time. If you look at the international comparisons, you find that there was enough sustenance for this Government's position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The judgment of the High Court is not without some degree of irony because those on the other side have opposed entrenching in our Constitution a Bill of Rights or the concepts of freedom. But in this decision the High Court has entrenched the freedom of political communication in our law. But not only does it do that; Justice Gaudron and, later, Justice Toohey have given signals that the High Court would contemplate going even further. The sorts of rights that they might be entertaining are those that have been marked out very definitely by Justice John Toohey in a speech he gave in Darwin to a constitutional convention last weekend. One particular paragraph is worth repeating. He said in his speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In that sense, an implied `Bill of Rights' might be constructed. (The common-law rights that might be expected in an implied Bill of Rights would be such things as freedom of speech, assembly and religion; freedom from search and seizure without a warrant based on sworn evidence and stating what can be searched and seized; freedom from arbitrary arrest; freedom from confiscation of property without compensation; no torture or other cruel or unusual punishment; and a right to trial by jury for serious crimes.)</PARA>
<PARA>So we have a signal from the High Court judges that they probably expect that they will be asked to address other rights in terms of their role not only in regard to the Constitution but in regard to the general body of law that underpins the constitutional system in this country. The major irony for me is that a concept tossed in by Justice Lionel Murphy was tossed out some six years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it does not end there in terms of ironies. Last week, Peter Costello, fearing that this decision opens the door to an activist role for the High Court, responded by saying that in the future we might have to give more parliamentary scrutiny to the appointment of High Court judges. As the office of my colleague Mr Duffy was quoted as saying last week, Costello's comments were a potential threat to the independence of the judiciary. The fact that he responds to a decision such as this by saying that we may have to pay more attention and give more parliamentary scrutiny to whom we appoint to the High Court is expressing a fear on his part that the High Court will and could work in a way that his side of politics would find unacceptable. We on our side would not attempt to politicise the Bench or muzzle the judges. As I indicated last week, the High Court made a decision; we had to cop it, and we do cop it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been accused of being hypocritical. If one wants to assess where hypocrisy lies in this debate, let us look at the record and let us look where this allegation of hypocrisy should rightfully land. In this matter of public importance, we are asked to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Applaud . . . the consistent stand of the Liberal and National Parties in their defence of free speech. . .</PARA>
<PARA>It was the Whitlam Government which signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. After a number of years of resistance in this country, it was ratified by the Fraser Government. That is the record of the Opposition; that was its role and that is where its commitment to civil liberties starts and ends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Bill of Rights was put up in this place by Senator Evans; it was opposed stridently by the Opposition. The Opposition opposed the enshrining of rights in our Constitution. A few years later we came back with constitutional amendments to embody in our Constitution a series of rights&mdash;the sorts of rights that Justice Gaudron and Justice Toohey talk about in their judgments: the right of one vote one value, the right to vote, freedom of religion, trial by jury and fair compensation for acquisition of property. Those rights were proposed by a bipartisan committee which included Sir Rupert Hamer, a former Premier of Victoria, on the other side of politics. But the Opposition stridently fought against enshrining those rights in our Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its decision last week the High Court signalled that the coalition's long term opposition to rights in the Constitution may in fact fail. Why was there opposition to enshrinement in the Constitution of civil rights? Senator Boswell is amongst those who today would want to vote in support of enshrinement of rights. On 5 November 1985, Senator Boswell stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill of Rights . . . will depend on an international covenant to dictate the rights of every Australian. We will not be introducing an international covenant as an Australian law.</PARA>
<PARA>He opposed it. Senator Harradine said it would not create another job, but that is neither here nor there. In February 1986, Senator Boswell said he would maintain a campaign. Senator Durack made this matter very clear on behalf of the Opposition, as Opposition spokesperson in this area, when he said in February 1986:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we will not join in an international covenant to bring human rights to everybody.</PARA>
<PARA>In February 1986, Brian Archer stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation [the Bill of Rights] is, undoubtedly, designed to ensure that crooks get the best end of the law.</PARA>
<PARA>He further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope that we can destroy the legislation for good and all.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the sort of history we are confronted with by those who are throwing the accusation of hypocrisy. One would think that those opposite would have gone through some sort of conversion in this process and that maybe they do now adopt and support the principle of human rights and civil liberties. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one body that opposed what I was doing&mdash;and which the Opposition latched onto like velcro&mdash;was the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. What do honourable senators reckon the Opposition wants to do to that body? It wanted to abolish it until a few months ago. Now Opposition senators will not abolish it; they will maintain it, but they will cut back $4m of its funding. The Commission used to be allocated $6m a year. Quite recently it was given the function of overseeing privacy legislation and was granted an extra $3m to do that. So it has a budget of $9m. Initially it had a budget of $6m to pursue civil rights issues. The Opposition is going to cut $4m out of the $6m&mdash;or out of the $9m if one wants to be generous to it. That is a gutting of HREOC. That is the Opposition's continual response to civil liberties in this country. It does not just end there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other organisation which we have in Government to keep us in contact with international civil rights and human rights mechanisms is the international law division of the Attorney-General's Department. The Opposition is going to shut that right up. It is going to shift the functions to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. It is going to shut up the mechanism in the Attorney-General's Department that keeps us in contact with international civil rights and it is going to gut HREOC. That is its response. It does not just end there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can look at what the Opposition is going to do with legal aid. There is nothing more basic in our society than access to law, but there will be a $10m cutback there. There will be a $17m cutback in the administration of justice. Let us not even think about getting into the area of basic rights of sole parents, migrants and Aboriginals. This is the commitment that those on the other side spell out very loudly.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator KERNOT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I would like to start by reflecting on the role of the High Court. The High Court is the umpire, the sole arbiter of Commonwealth constitutional matters&mdash;and we accept that. One alternative would be to have one of the great ideas of the Young Liberals&mdash;a privatised judiciary. Another alternative would be to have the American system of an elected judiciary. I think our system is preferable to those, but that does not mean to say that the High Court is above criticism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found the logic of parts of the High Court decision quite inconsistent. The High Court said, `Yes, it's okay, the Commonwealth has power to make laws on elections; yes, the Commonwealth has the power to make laws over broadcasting; but it does not have the power to make laws over the broadcasting of electoral advertising material'. Four of the seven High Court judges ruled that the advertising ban should be totally struck out while two others rejected just part of the legislation. Six of the judges acknowledged that there was an implied right of free speech&mdash;not just any absolute free speech but the `freedom to discuss and debate political and public affairs'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome confirmation that there are implied human rights in our Constitution. It is not a cause that the Opposition has championed in the past. I recall that it was extremely critical of Justice Murphy over the many years that he championed this cause. But it does seem to be rather selective to say that the right to discuss and debate political and public affairs is more important than perhaps freedom of assembly and association, freedom of movement, the rights of a person charged with a criminal offence, the protection of individual privacy&mdash;in other words, what one might expect to find in a Bill of Rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can we expect the new champions of human rights in Australia&mdash;the Party that was going to abolish the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission&mdash;to extend their passion for one implied freedom to other equally important freedoms? What did the Liberals say about a Bill of Rights? They opposed it. In opposing the Bill of Rights, in not seeking to improve it by amending it, they opposed many specific rights of Australians. They opposed the right to privacy and the rights of children for which the Bill provided. In voting against a Bill of Rights, in choosing not to improve it by amending it, they opposed the right to trial by jury, to due process and the legislated right to freedom of religion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not an absolute. How can we believe the Opposition's new found zeal? The Opposition's record clearly is opposed to human rights. For example, the Opposition believes that workers should not have the right to be protected by minimum award conditions; that is, workers should not have the right not to be exploited by their terms of employment. Clearly, most employers in Australia are not ogres but some are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When discussing the Opposition's record on protecting human rights we must remember before the referendum in 1988 the absolutely disgraceful conduct of Mr Peter Reith in using his free speech to conduct what I consider perhaps the worst propaganda campaign in Australian politics to oppose a constitutional change to guarantee some basic human rights. A major political party in this country actively campaigned against religious freedom, against fair elections and against the right to trial by jury&mdash;and the list goes on. </PARA>

How hypocritical of them to call themselves the defenders of free speech and democracy in Australia. Where do the Liberals stand on the nexus between democracy and money? To the Liberal Party, freedom of speech equals freedom for those who can afford to pay for that speech to be broadcast. This is encapsulated by a cartoon I think in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> which shows men from FACTS, the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Services, with dollar signs in their eyeballs saying with glee, `Just exactly how much free speech would you like to buy?'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was developing the point of the nexus between free speech and money, and I was about to quote from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Best Congress Money Can Buy</EMPHASIS>. The central theme of this book is that money determines far too much in American politics today. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Far too often, money determines who shall run for office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All too often, money determines what messages will be most forcefully conveyed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much too often, money is a preoccupation (or an obsession) in the minds of lawmakers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet that prime determinant, money, is a poor tool of democracy, for money is indifferent to truth and to justice, since it is, essentially, unjustly distributed.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the point. It is precisely this unjust distribution which makes a mockery of this defence of the absolute freedom of speech. Anatole France in the late nineteenth century said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The law, in its majestic equality, permits the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread.</PARA>
<PARA>Judge J. Skelly Wright, in reflecting on that after observing American election campaigns, felt that Anatole France might well have written:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The law, in its majestic equality, allows the poor as well as the rich to form political action committees, to purchase the most sophisticated polling, media, and direct mail techniques, and to drown out each other's voices by overwhelming expenditures in political campaigns.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier today, how far the new Democrats have come from the old Democrats. Janine Haines and former Senator Don Chipp would not have had a bar of this attempt by the Democrats to ban political advertising, and they said it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot is right to be embarrassed, because she has been found out.

Along with her colleagues, she has also lost any element of principle. Senator Kernot is now walking out of the chamber, because as usual when there is a contrary argument the Democrats do not want to hear. These are the people who constantly support freedom of speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, a nasty authoritarian streak is appearing in the political process in this country. We have seen it particularly manifesting itself in this Bill to ban political advertising. If Senator Schacht, Senator Bolkus and Senator Kernot were fair dinkum and worried about the costs of elections and the rights of independents to put their views, they would not be banning political advertising; they would be banning direct mail. Direct mail is the most effective but costly form of political campaigning at the present time. It is only accessible to the major parties who have the resources to conduct this comparatively new form of campaigning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, if we wanted to test the logic and sincerity of Senator Kernot and Senator Bolkus, we would have seen them arguing against direct mail. I am one who thinks there are elements in political advertising which can cause problems, but at least we have the right to respond publicly and quickly. Whatever the faults of political advertising, they are writ large in the process of direct mail. Of course, Senator Kernot was caught out very recently with her direct mail to the farm machinery producers. She conveyed to them what we believe to be grossly misleading information and she came into this chamber and attempted to justify it. Of course, Senator Kernot was once again found out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is probably one aspect of Senator Bolkus's speech with which I did concur and that is that this whole debate is replete with ironies. It was an irony that Senator Bolkus urged us in this chamber to listen to the Human Rights Commission and to retain the Human Rights Commission, which we are doing. But Senator Bolkus ignored the advice of the Human Rights Commissioner. One really wonders how committed Senator Bolkus is to the Human Rights Commission when in probably the most controversial action the Human Rights Commission has been involved in, in relation to political advertising, the Government assiduously ignored its advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then Senator Bolkus came in and said that other countries that have a bill of rights ban political advertising. I guess the real reason a lot of people in this Parliament were very concerned about the Bill of Rights issue when it was debated was that Senator Bolkus said in his own speech that a bill of rights in effect does not protect freedoms and freedoms of speech. As I said, he pointed to countries that have a bill of rights and where the freedom of speech in relation to political advertising is banned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can understand the embarrassment of Senator Bolkus at an article which I believe summed up the feelings of many people in the community. The article by Peter Wilson in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> pointed to the gross mishandling of this Bill and stated that it was perhaps the most embarrassing bungle in a long history of bungles by this Government. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supporters of the 42-year-old South Australian left winger argued this week that he should not shoulder all the blame and, to be fair, there were a few hands on the steering wheel.</PARA>
<PARA>That is true, and two of the hands on the steering wheel were those of Senator Chris Schacht and Senator John Faulkner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht regularly comes into this chamber and talks about human rights. I do not entirely doubt the sincerity of Senator Schacht on human rights; he has made the subject a special interest of his. But in the end I guess real commitment to human rights is shown by how committed one is when the views actually conflict with the policy of one's party. That is when one is really tested. One can go overseas and lecture to the South Africans, lecture to the Chinese, go around the world and tell them what you think they should be doing. But the question is: how does one act when human rights issues conflict with the narrow interests of one's own political party?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that Senator Schacht has been tested in relation to political advertising. It is not that he expressed concern in the party room and then generally removed himself from this debate, as I guess often happens on both sides when members find themselves in conflict with their parties. Senator Schacht, as Chairman of the Select Committee that examined the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill, took the lead role in trying to ram this legislation through. He, along with Senator Bolkus, was one of the driving forces behind the Bill. Indeed, it is a great irony&mdash;I do not think it will be forgotten in this chamber&mdash;that when Senator Schacht, who has at times spoken some sense on human rights issues, was tested and when his hand was put to the fire, he decided to be one of the Bill's great promoters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there are some concerns about the behaviour and the judgments in recent years of the High Court. Senator Bolkus raised that point. I happen to think on this particular issue that the court got it right, but I would not want it to be thought that a lot of people are not looking closely at the activities and judgments of the High Court. Time, as Senator Bolkus said, will show just how this new decision works through. Maybe it will work in surprising ways. Maybe it will end the rights of the closed shop. Maybe it will enable workers to exercise true freedom of choice in deciding whether to join a trade union or not. So I think quite a few freedoms will be tested, and undoubtedly we will be watching the High Court closely to see how it works itself through these judgments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus said that no-one expected this legislation to be thrown out. I refer him to the evidence that was presented to the Select Committee. I think it would be ungracious of me not to mention the contributions that my colleague Senator Macdonald made on this important issue. In this chamber on Tuesday 3 December, Senator Macdonald on a number of occasions alerted us to the fact that the legislation was liable to be found to be unconstitutional. It did not come as a surprise to many people. It might have come as a surprise to Senator Bolkus, but that may reflect his capacities as a lawyer. </PARA>

What we find is a Minister who came into this place in April and August of last year and tried to tell us that the expression `freedom of speech' means that speech which is not bought. This notion was laughable. It was laughed at by the entire Attorney-General's Department when it was put to it, and it was laughed at by most serious commentators on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) has displayed in his speech tonight that he either has no capacity to think for himself about the substance of these issues, or that his embarrassment at having failed in this project of limiting freedom of speech in Australia has occasioned him not to say what he really thinks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus in his speech said that there are four things we should know. He said we should know that there is one party that supports human rights&mdash;I suppose he thinks that is his Party&mdash;and one party that is against them. I suppose he would like to paint that as being the Liberal and National parties. Then he says that everything the Government has done is in accord with international responses. In other words, the Government has done only what everyone else does. The fourth thing the Minister said in his speech was that this move by the High Court was a surprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister is wrong on all four counts. The Labor Party does have a proud record in relation to human rights issues. I do not deny that and I do not know that anyone else does. It is a proud record marred only, I might say, by a very black spot put on it by Senator Bolkus in seeking to limit freedom of speech in this country. Nonetheless, I do not deny that, other than for that black spot, the Government has a very proud record. I think it is uncharitable of the Minister to suggest that my Party does not have a similar record. We might say that these rights should be protected in different ways, but we do not say that they should not exist or be protected in no way at all. </PARA>

Why do we not just do a survey of what other countries are doing and follow suit? It is a ludicrous argument. It is ludicrous for a Minister of a government to come in here and say, `We have done what everyone else has done'. Why do the people in the galleries pay our salaries if they only want us to do what everyone else does? We could run the country by survey. Would that be a good idea? Of course not. The expectation is that we will look at what other people do, decide for ourselves whether it is a good idea and articulate substantive reasons as to why it is a good idea. That other people are doing it is not a substantive reason. That is the lemmings to the cliff face argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the technical legal reasoning of the decision of the High Court, some may think that it is a surprise, but I draw the Minister's attention to a speech I made in August of last year which drew his attention to the Murphy judgment on the Ansett Transport Industries case. Murphy said that there needed to be freedom in relation to speech and other communication, `not only between the States, but in and between every part of the Commonwealth'. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From these provisions and from the concept of the Commonwealth arises an implication of a constitutional guarantee of such freedoms, freedoms so elementary that it was not necessary to mention them in the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Bolkus thinks that in some ironical way, the High Court has now returned to a position more closely aligned with former Senator Murphy than it was at the time. I do not think that is ironical at all. That is what the legal system and the High Court is all about. Law is always developing with people changing their minds, moving on, et cetera. These things are not meant to be set in concrete. The law is meant to develop as is our understanding of it, just as society develops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister says, `Watch out with your industrial relations reforms or you'll be in trouble'. I look forward to a greater elucidation from the court as to what it thinks these powers or implied or assumed rights are. Nothing pleases me more than a greater test of the constitutional limitations that we live under. That is what the High Court is there for, and I do not walk away from that. If the Minister thinks that that is a problem, he has a different view from mine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, the Minister said that the concept of a right to freedom of speech in relation to political ideas is new and that nobody has mentioned it. We already know that Murphy had. I also draw his attention to some comments I made on 17 April, particularly to elucidate an argument that might well have informed his mind. In that speech I drew his attention to a number of United States cases, which basically put a simple proposition. You do not need to go to the Human Rights Commission to be told this or to study law to understand it; you just need to understand the premises on which this place works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How does it work? People get elected to do what other people want. Every now and then we have an election. People like those in the gallery can decide whether they want to re-elect those opposite&mdash;I do not think they will re-elect them next time&mdash;or whether they would like to elect us. They will also decide how many of these magpies of politics that are under the table, otherwise referred to as the Australian Democrats, or Independents they will elect. How will they do that? They will only do that if they have some idea of what we think and what we and the Government have done. Information in relation to these matters is passed on through advertising. I admit that not all of it is substantive, but advertising does not have to be substantive to pass on a message. All it has to do is promote debate on the political issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my speech in April I drew the Minister's attention to the case of Monitor Patriot Co. v Roy, in which he would have found in relation to the freedom of speech argument in the United States these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . has its fullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The judgment of another case, Mills v Alabama, states:</PARA>

<PARA>that is, the free speech amendment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs . . . including discussions of candidates.</PARA>
<PARA>Another United States case, Buckley v Valeo, is worth mentioning. In that case, the point was made that the Government, in seeking to put a limitation on the restriction of advertising, was necessarily reducing the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration and the size of the audience it reached. The court went on to point out that it would be disastrous to exclude all citizens and groups, except candidates and political parties and the institutional press, from the use of the most effective modes of communication. Television and radio have become the most indispensable instruments of effective political free speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the argument of cost that has been raised by both the Australian Democrats and the Labor Party. They want to say that people with money are bad bogymen. I do not attribute bad faith to people with money in the first instance. This point is constantly repeated in a number of United States cases: one cannot make the assumption that just because one person has $2,000 that person ought not be able to put his or her view. One cannot make that assumption, because if 2,000 people want to put a view and they all put in a dollar they will have the $2,000 to put their view. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to this matter of public importance that has been raised by the Liberal Party and deal with a couple of matters arising out of the decision of the High Court. I, like a number of people, have had a chance to read the decision that has been given. All of us will take some time to study in depth the reasons behind the judgment of the High Court. Firstly, it was not a unanimous decision. Even amongst the four who voted one way, different opinions are given about the reasoning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that determining the real meaning of this decision will be a feast for the constitutional lawyers, who are trying to get grants for the next 20 years. The basic decision of the High Court is that, in our Constitution, there is an implied right to freedom of communication. Justice Mason uses the term `freedom of communication' on page 18 of the decision&mdash;he does not use `freedom of speech'&mdash;as though he is more interested in the delivery modes of speech rather than free speech itself. That is a significant difference. I believe that he is trying to get around his very difficult position in this decision of implying that under the Constitution the Government's legislation was not valid. Nowhere in his decision does Justice Mason quote a particular clause of the Constitution to guarantee the implication of freedom of communication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The judgment quotes various decisions of similar cases in Canada, the United States and Great Britain. It quotes all the other similar democracies comparable to ours but completely ignores the fact that all those other comparable countries already have limits, or outright bans, on political advertising. Justice Mason blithely ignores that precedent in those countries and talks about freedom of communication. On page 18, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only by exercising that freedom&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the freedom of communication&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">can the citizen communicate his or her views on the wide range of matters that may call for, or are relevant to, political action or decision.</PARA>
<PARA>On page 19, he quotes Professor Harrison Moore:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . "[t]he great underlying principle" of the Constitution was that the rights of individuals were sufficiently secured by ensuring each an equal share in political power.</PARA>
<PARA>Nowhere does he come to terms with the fact that the ability to exercise political power in our community can be very much influenced by access to financial resources. Justice Mason made a very substantial mistake in not understanding that an equal share means that one does not allow money to determine how much of that equal share one has. Again, it shows a lack of understanding of the political process in a modern society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 21 of his decision, Justice Mason says that we are not talking about a bill of rights. He does not want to get into an argument that there is a bill of rights which has an expanded view about freedom of speech. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether freedom of communication in relation to public affairs and political discussion is substantially different from an unlimited freedom of communication. . .</PARA>
<PARA>He is trying to get off the hook of implying that there is freedom of speech in the Constitution while wanting to imply that there is freedom of communication. It is legal sophistry at its worst and it does not do our High Court any good to use it to try to get itself off its own hook. On page 23 of the judgment Justice Mason says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Generally speaking, it will be extremely difficult to justify restrictions imposed on free communication which operate by reference to the character of the ideas or information.</PARA>
<PARA>That means that if some people in the community who want to form themselves into a political party can get around every other limitation we have elsewhere in the laws, such as limits on obscenity, and various other judgments that have been made by law which have been upheld&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was speaking about the judgment of the High Court and, in particular, comments made by Chief Justice Mason in the decision of the High Court to oppose the Government's legislation and to declare it unconstitutional in that there is an implied freedom of communication in the Constitution. Page 23 of his decision says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Generally speaking, it will be extremely difficult to justify restrictions imposed on free communication which operate by reference to the character of the ideas or information.</PARA>
<PARA>In that particular section he raises in my mind the spectre that this will override much of the legislation of the governments of Australia&mdash;Federal and State&mdash;over the last 100 years or more on such things as obscenity and defamation. For example, I do not think it stretches the imagination too much to say that if this position proceeds the X-rated movie industry based here in Canberra could form a political party and then use that as a basis to say that it could distribute its material under the guise of freedom of communication, if not freedom of speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the sorts of implications that come about when we have a High Court ruling that says there is an implied, not a direct, power in the Constitution. I do not believe Australian parliaments and the Australian people ought to automatically accept the High Court's right to imply anything into the Constitution. It is the people themselves, either directly through referendum or in the parliaments of Australia, who should have the final say. On page 24 of the same decision Chief Justice Mason says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, in the ultimate analysis, it is for the Court to determine whether the constitutional guarantee has been infringed in a given case. And the Court must scrutinize with scrupulous care restrictions affecting free communication in the conduct of elections for political office for it is in that area that the guarantee fulfils its primary purpose.</PARA>
<PARA>I reject that notion. I think the Australian people should reject the notion that an unelected appointed body, the High Court of Australia, can determine what the laws of Australia are by saying it is implied in the Constitution. My notion of democracy and the notion of democracy of this Australian community is that it elects people to Parliament to make the laws and if it does not like what they make it votes them out at the next election. It is a very simple definition of democracy, but I think it is the best going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not like the idea that unelected non-responsible organisations, even as august as the High Court, can say that the legislature can have its laws overturned because in its judgment there is something implied. I would accept it to be different if it said that a particular clause of the Constitution, which is clear-cut, has been broken and it rules that way but I do not accept that an implied power can overrule the legislation of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that last week the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Peter Costello, noted the significance of the High Court's decision and raised the issue that judges of the High Court will have to come under review and discussion about their political role. He accepts the fact that the judges will be making political decisions which are open to wide interpretation. That is a road that the High Court of Australia has previously not gone down, although I believe sometimes in the past, even interpreting particular sections of the Constitution, High Court judges have not been able to divorce their political preferences or prejudices from the decisions they make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that in this issue we will have to have a wide community debate to work out what are the responsibilities of the legislature and what are the responsibilities of the High Court. Chief Justice Mason believes that the High Court has the power to overturn legislation. Apparently only yesterday Justice Toohey argued in a speech in Darwin&mdash;I am quoting from the press so I do not know whether this is a direct quote&mdash;that the High Court had the power and the right to frustrate the will of Parliament by striking down legislation in order to protect and promote individual liberty. That is a statement by one of the justices of the High Court which indicates that as far as he is concerned they have a much wider role than they have had in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to conservative members opposite that at the moment they are lauding this decision of the High Court by seeing it in terms of a political victory. But I suspect that this issue will come back and bite them at some stage in the future and they will be screaming and jumping up and down that the High Court, under the guise and interpretation that Justice Toohey has taken, has a wider role to `frustrate' the will of Parliament. I do not believe any unelected body has the right to frustrate the will of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If justices of the High Court&mdash;whether it is Justice Toohey or Chief Justice Mason&mdash;believe that there is an implied right to guarantee the freedom of communication and overturn legislation, it is no longer a legal view, it is a political view. If they have that political view they should step down from the High Court and stand for Parliament and take the political debate on. They should not use the High Court bench to make political statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early 1940s Justice Evatt stepped down from the High Court where he had served for at least 10 years to stand for Parliament. He was elected and then served in the Australian Parliament for nearly 20 years. He understood the difference between a judicial interpretation and political activity. He did the honourable thing of putting himself in front of the people to be elected to this Parliament and to take part in the public debate. We are going to have a position where members of the public and members of the Parliament will criticise judges of the High Court and judges will probably say that this is an attack on the independence of the judiciary. When they start making political decisions, such as they did last week when they overrode the Government's legislation, they are relying on an implied power which is open to the widest interpretation. I do not believe that in any form of sensible democracy we should allow a group of people, unelected, appointed to the age of 70, to have the power to make that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, if the High Court is only carrying out a judicial role of interpretation of specific sections of the Constitution we can certainly accept that people with eminent legal qualifications should be appointed to the High Court. Once it starts making political decisions, the Parliament of Australia and the people will start demanding that the members of the High Court reflect a wider view in the community than those who just happen to have served the whole of their lives in the legal profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think anyone could say that the present seven High Court justices represent the balance of the Australian community. Six of the seven are white Anglo-Saxon males and the other is a female white Anglo-Saxon. They do not represent a broad cross-section of the Australian community by either experience or occupation. If they are going to make political judgments, the High Court ought to reflect the make-up and the mixture of the Australian community. Therefore, the demand will come very quickly that we should appoint people to the High Court who reflect the community and not reflect some high legal qualification alone because they are not reflecting the community at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been a momentous decision by the High Court. It is much wider than just the issue of the Government's Bill that was passed in this Parliament last year. There are fundamental issues at stake. The High Court has put its foot in the water and I only hope that the community over the coming months and years has an opportunity to define how the High Court should operate and that we do not allow seven unelected members of the High Court to second-judge every piece of legislation that the elected representatives of the Australian Parliament pass. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for the Senate to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Applaud the finding of the High Court that the political advertising provisions of the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1991 are invalid, thus supporting the consistent stand of the Liberal and National Parties in their defence of freedom of speech and democracy in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Condemn the Minister for persisting with legislation, which attacked freedom of speech and freedom of political expression and subsequently claiming, when it was found to be unconstitutional, that the decision was a victory for freedom of speech in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>That, surprisingly enough, is what we are discussing tonight&mdash;not the bagging of the High Court judges that we have just heard from Senator Schacht. Anyone would think that now that the decision has been made it is open slather for the Labor Party to attack the High Court judges, to attack their alleged political bias, to attack their integrity and, to cap it off, to say that they do not reflect the community. Is that not wonderful? The decision is wrong, it has been taken to the High Court and proven to be wrong, and yet the Government still does not accept it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, Senator Schacht said, `I do not accept that an unelected non-responsible body can overturn legislation'. They were his words. I am surprised that he has not jolly well got used to it by now. On 5 September 1985, we saw the invalidation of provisions in the Conciliation and Arbitration (Electricity Industry) Act 1985 that sought to combat Queensland industrial legislation by bringing Queensland power workers under a special Commonwealth arbitration scheme. The law was invalid because it discriminated against a State. That decision was overturned by the High Court. On 12 August 1988, the High Court declared that Government advertisements in support of the referendum campaigns were improper expenditure. The High Court said that this Government was wrong again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 24 November 1988, section 7 of the Migration Act, which provided for the collection of fees for immigration clearance, was declared invalid. This Government was wrong again. On 8 February 1989, the Corporations Act that sought to control incorporation was ruled invalid. This Government was wrong again. On 1 March 1990, the Executive Government was ruled to have no power to grant additional stamp allowance to members of the House of Representatives in addition to the allowance received under the Remuneration Tribunal. This Government was wrong yet again. And, of course, we have seen the pathologists take this Government to the High Court and win. The Government was wrong again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How many decisions does this Government have to make that are wrong and that are taken to the High Court before it learns? Here is an absolute litany of mistakes, and yet the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) can come in here today, and Senator Kernot from the Australian Democrats, and still plead innocence, rather than say, `I am sorry, but we goofed. We were wrong; we should not have done it'. Why do they not have the courage of their convictions and turn around and say to the Australian people, `I am sorry; we did make another mistake'. It is not the first mistake, as I have just said; it is one of many. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking to this matter of public importance, I wish to focus particularly on the actions of the Minister for Administrative Services who now purports to welcome a new era of freedom of speech although he was so anxious to limit this right previously. Mind you, he welcomed it on radio last week, but he has not necessarily welcomed it in here today. At Question Time today, Senator Parer, the shadow Minister for Administrative Services, asked Senator Bolkus a range of questions about the costs involved and a whole lot of other questions that relate to this matter and, of course, he was unable to answer one of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All he did was string out an array of abuse and did not answer the question. In his contribution to this matter of public importance he still has not answered the crucial questions. He welcomed it with open arms last week, but has gone decidedly cold on it this week. Obviously his political masters have said to him, `Cool it. This is not as good for us as we thought it was because this Opposition&mdash;soon to be the Government&mdash;is going to be able to expose how we have ruined this country over nine years of government'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the same Minister whose major objective was to sanitise the political process and wilfully ignore disinterested and expert advice to the contrary. He still will not provide for the Senate the advice that he was given while the legislation was going through. He said on 1 October that he is glad that the High Court has `signalled entrenchment of freedom of communication and freedom of speech as part of the general legal system'. These are the very rights that he sought to infringe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a sanctimonious lot of garbage we heard this afternoon from Senator Kernot. She tried to quote from the speech that I made in the debate in this chamber on the Bill of Rights, even though she did not participate in that debate. It was a debate that showed how flawed the Government's proposal on the Bill of Rights was. It also quite clearly showed that a lot of the things that they were trying to legislate for were already in place. I find it amazing that Senator Kernot can come into this chamber and say that we should have a bill of rights in order to have freedom of speech. Last week we had a decision by the High Court supporting the fact that the Constitution already has in it an inherent right of freedom of speech. Why do we need a bill of rights to spell it out?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot is not bright enough to be able to twig that. She still comes in here and says that we need a bill of rights. She is prepared to make one mistake after another. She made this one today in respect of the political ad ban Bill, and she still wants to go on and make another mistake by foisting on us a bill of rights that the electorate did not want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also add that the Australia Card Bill of 1987 was lost because of the incompetence of this Government in requiring a disallowable regulation as a necessary part of its operation. This is another example, added to all the those others that I have given, of where this Government has goofed. The Minister welcomes the entrenching of `the respect for freedom of communication in political matters' that his Government and the Democrats were trying to limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats cannot get off scot-free because they were hand in glove with the Government. They were quite happy to accept this legislation because they knew they were going to get more money out of it; they knew they were going to get more ads. When they cannot even rake up 3 per cent in a State election, is it any wonder that they want more? They could only rake up four candidates in Victoria and it is no wonder they want more public funded advertising. It is about time this Government turned around and saw what it was doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Minister was saying throughout the public debate on this legislation was reflected in an article in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 21 March last year. The Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill reflected our&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the Labor Party's&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>The previous day on ABC television the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is pretty clear at a Federal level that we have not and nor do I pretend to identify corruption.</PARA>
<PARA>In effect, the Minister disclaimed the one factor that could possibly be invoked seriously to justify infringing rights of free expression. But does he worry about that? Not at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have, therefore, a Labor Minister who is committed to the Orwellian concept of sanitising our democratic procedures to somehow protect us from ourselves. In so doing he was clearly anxious to limit the rights of freedom of speech. Who supported them in doing so? It was the Australian Democrats. It was the same Minister who, in a response to a question on 11 April last year, trotted out the specious argument that political advertising did not represent free speech, but something else that he stigmatised as bought speech. That was another excuse that he used all the way along the line&mdash;that if we did not pass the legislation it would be bought speech. We knew better. We know what this Government is like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Minister went on to quote what was said by that hardly objective and unbiased authority, Phillip Adams, the guru of political correctness&mdash;that `we are not jeopardising free speech but defending it'. It sounds to me awfully like Saddam Hussein trying to liberate Kuwait; it sounds exactly the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the arguments used by the Minister and supporters such as the Democrats were illogical and dangerous. If political broadcast media advertising constituted `bought speech', this definition could be extended to all other forms of advertising and, indeed, to all forms of political communication other than the unaided human voice. I think the decision of the High Court last week was correct. Certainly, it is about time that the Government and the Democrats came clean and told us what it cost and who gave them their advice in the first place. </PARA>

Perhaps the Labor Party has had some luck with chook raffles and lamington drives, and it now has some money to spend. I suppose, Senator Faulkner, that that is the reason for the change of heart. That is one of the reasons why I believe Senator Bolkus is not the slightest bit embarrassed by the High Court throwing out his legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we all know that to be a success in the Labor Party one has to be versatile. Nowhere has more versatility been shown by the government of the day than in the area of policy. One year the Labor Party supports a GST; the next year it bags it as an evil and deadly proposition. One year it supports a ban on political advertising and just as easily it supports the removal of such a ban. What flexibility and what agility that is! It is a contortionist act of great proportions. And we wonder why people view politicians and political parties with such cynicism!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus has always been very adaptable on this issue. In December 1990 he was asked by Senator Parer whether he was preparing legislation to ban election advertisements. He responded that he was not. Three months later&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;the Federal Cabinet was discussing legislation to do just that. The plan was being put to Cabinet by guess who&mdash;the bearded man on the other side, Senator Bolkus, to give him his correct title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government and Senator Bolkus were obviously surprised at the community outcry to their proposals so they did what this Government seems to do with consummate ease: they changed their minds and they redrafted the legislation, thinking it would scrape through. Once again they got it wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Bolkus, brave and fearless that he is, was clearly not prepared to take on the advertising industry, the Human Rights Commission, various legal groups, the National Farmers Federation, the Business Council of Australia, the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters, the Brotherhood of Saint Laurence, the Forest Industries Association and the Australian Mining Industry Council. In fact, just about no group in Australia was not offended. One cannot blame Senator Bolkus for trying to win back brownie points somewhere. So the legislation was made a little less draconian&mdash;no fairer, mind you, no more democratic but a little less autocratic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus no doubt triumphed at this great progress. He had the legislation he wanted. He convinced half a dozen people in the Australian Democrats that he and the ACTU were right and he probably thought the ALP would reward him for great services to the financial prosperity of the Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He did not count on the tenacity and the strength of the judicial system in this country. He obviously thought that with power, such as the ACTU, behind him, a mere handful of High Court judges would not dream of ruling against him. He felt secure sitting in his position on the other side of the chamber behind his beard. He obviously thought he had the power to do anything that he wanted to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But as we all know, the High Court handed down a judgment which changed all that. The High Court judges actually came to the brave conclusion that Australians have a right to free speech. Six of the seven judges found that Australia's system of representative government did imply a right to speak freely on political and public issues. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> fairly described the original legislation as a political stunt; the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Australian</EMPHASIS> called the decision an historic ruling heralding a revolution in media law; the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> called it `a major advance for free speech'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not to be outdone, our intrepid and never-say-die Senator Bolkus was not going to let a simple landmark decision of the High Court get better press than he could. He came out and said with stupefying simplicity that the decision was a `first step towards entrenching in our legal system respect for rights and in this case it's freedom of communication in political matters'. In other words, he was applauding what the High Court had done, as if it were his idea to oppose his own legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus is a contortionist of great calibre in the political arena. Either Senator Bolkus is totally confused and totally schizophrenic or he is trying to be all things to all men at all times. I just wonder what he is. Perhaps he is nobody to anybody at any time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus's capitulations and turnarounds are mere kids stuff. He has only done one 360 degree turn. Prime Minister Keating does them so often that he will soon be known as our revolving Prime Minister. Of course, the Prime Minister is on record as saying at the tax summit in 1985 that he favours an indirect tax. He told the tax summit that we must adopt a consumption tax and that failure to do so will see the end of any significant taxation reform in this century. But he now slams the Opposition for daring to propose such reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But like all things that revolve and pass, so too will Senator Bolkus's time as Minister; so too will this appalling Federal Labor Government. Just as the Victorian community demonstrated on Saturday that it will not tolerate incompetent government, neither will the rest of Australia tolerate this incompetent Government and its incompetent Ministers. There will be a farewell to Minister Bolkus, Prime Minister Keating and the rest of his acrobatic juggling team. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contortionist tricks of the bearded senator opposite are the most remarkable by any Minister in any Parliament anywhere in the Western world. It has been said that the very concept of representative government and representative democracy signifies government by the people through their representatives. The representatives, of necessity, are accountable to the people. By not allowing people to advertise on the electronic media during election periods, this Government and this Minister, Senator Bolkus, were trying to stifle that concept. Now the contortionist has done his back flip. I would say that the degree of difficulty was about 6.2. He has done a bellyflop in the middle of the pool. I would say that it would have hurt his stomach and it would have hurt the stomach of the Party that he represents. It ensured that he is now a discredited Minister in this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government had two objectives in proposing this Bill: firstly, to contain the costs of election campaigns and, secondly, to eliminate the sleaze factor which was becoming more evident in Australian politics. It was not only a proposal for a political ad ban; there were also the disclosure provisions of the Bill. I am pleased to say that those provisions are still intact. I cannot join with the Opposition, as it asks the Senate to do in this matter of public importance, in applauding the finding of the High Court in relation to the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act. I was a strong supporter of the Bill and the principles behind the Bill. I wish to concentrate on those parts of this MPI which deal with the alleged attacks on free speech and freedom of expression.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that political advertising on the electronic media is very expensive and that it is only available to those people who can afford to use it&mdash;the very few large political parties or extremely wealthy candidates who can afford the cost of an electronic advertising campaign. A political party or a political candidate is incapable of expressing complex ideas in electronic media advertising. There is no doubt that this sort of advertising distorts and trivialises the political process. It leads to the sort of situation that exists in the United States&mdash;of influence buying and the huge need for money to run any sort of competitive election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government tried to remove, as far as was possible, the influence of money from election campaigning. That is a worthy aim and objective and it is one that I certainly still support. The proposition that spending money in any way equals free speech is absolute nonsense because there is an unequal and unjust distribution of money in our society. If we look at the nature of Australian election campaigns it becomes obvious that this decision&mdash;what has been described as a landmark finding&mdash;of the High Court is going to have a huge impact. It has already started. The Liberal Party of Australia has brought two Republicans from the United States of America to Australia as consultants to run its electronic media campaigns, a Mr Larry Cirirgnano and a Mr Bruce Blakeman. Apparently, they were responsible for producing the Liberal pamphlets featuring scared old ladies behind doors because of what the Labor Party had done to make our society unsafe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They really got into the act in the Queensland election. The sleazy advertising of the Liberal Party in Queensland reached a new low. I am pleased to say that the electorate of Queensland passed an appropriate judgment on the Queensland Liberal Party and its ads; it managed to win only nine seats in the Queensland Parliament. That was Mr Robb's first action. Mr Robb, the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, brought out these two characters from the Republican Party in America because he could not run an election campaign himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Robb's second act of genius was to start an electronic media campaign aimed at denigrating the Prime Minister, Mr Keating. It consists of typical Liberal Party distortions. It involves Mr Keating uttering the words about the recession we had to have. The film and the sound tape are slowed down five or six times until the message becomes completely distorted. It is negative, as one would expect from the Liberal Party. It is low life, as one would expect from the Liberal Party. It lowers the standard of political debate in Australia absolutely, as one would expect from the Liberal Party. It trivialises politics in this country, as one would expect from the Liberal Party. It is hypocritical Liberal sleaze. It is contemptible gutter tactics from the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has been followed up with another advertisement designed by Mr Robb and these two hired honchos from the Republican Party in the USA&mdash;an ad that superimposes the Prime Minister's face over the face of a factory worker, while Dr Hewson walks around extolling the virtues of the now nearly totally discredited Fightback package. It is very interesting to note that it is not a car factory that Dr Hewson is strolling around. I am not at all concerned about the decision of the High Court in the sense of it disadvantaging the Labor Party. There is no doubt in my mind that the advantage that the Labor Party has had in electronic campaigning literally over decades will remain. We will be advantaged in the next election campaign by this decision, even though the principle is one that I do not support.

<PARA>As this annual report of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation clearly shows in the Chairman's opening letter, the year in review has not been one with very many positives for the Australian meat and livestock industry. The Chairman writes in the report that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Adverse seasonal and economic conditions had a severe impact on the Australian meat and livestock industry in the year under review.</PARA>
<PARA>The Chairman continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Widespread and severe drought was experienced in Queensland and western New South Wales, resulting in an increased rate of cattle turn-off.</PARA>
<PARA>Regrettably, this is still the same in much of New South Wales and, indeed, a great deal of Queensland at the present time. The Chairman further writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequently, Australian beef cattle to the United States were at high levels.</PARA>
<PARA>The impact of the United States meat import law was felt twice by the industry with control schemes being introduced in September 1991 and in June 1992. These schemes had a dramatic downward effect on cattle prices, especially during 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a brighter note, Australia marginally increased its share of the Japanese beef market and exports to Korea grew strongly. These north Asian markets, together with Taiwan, accounted for 41 per cent of Australian beef exports. Lamb exports fell during 1991-92 as a result of lower production levels, and I have no doubt that this was influenced also by the very severe drought that parts of Australia are having. Mutton exports, however, were maintained at the higher levels of the previous year. Mutton prices have improved over the very low levels experienced by producers during 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as is the case in most Australian industries during this recession we had to have, the continuing economic downturn has also had an impact on domestic meat consumption. Beef has been the most affected in this area. Consumers, naturally, have turned to cheaper meats or other alternatives as they also fight to beat the problems they face in making the family budget balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the debate in recent weeks has focused on free and fair trade issues and on the question of protection and tariffs, the horrendous impact of the domestic costs has not received the attention that it warrants. Already some 60 per cent of the cause of reduced incomes to rural industries today relates directly to our internal structures on interest rates, inflation, outdated work practices and the sustained and continuing attack on the productive sector and its assets. It does not matter whether we produce the goods. Factors outside the farm, such as disastrous Government decisions on rural issues in addition to the Government's economic policies, mean that being on the land is just not profitable. I certainly speak as one who has experience, who lives on the land and who regrettably has to pay all the bills that we get there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate: primary industry is not as fully recognised as it should be in this country. It is no use sending a delegation of Ministers or even the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to the United States or the European Economic Community when these countries have no intention in the long run of reducing support for their producers and consumers. I believe that this is a very important fact to remember. We know that here in Australia we are efficient upon the farm. But if there is a problem, as there is in a number of our primary industries, the Government ought to come to our support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the other support that government gives to primary industry in this country. We get a rebate on diesel fuel certainly, and there are other little forms of assistance. But we should compare what is given in Australia with what is given in other countries against which our farmers have to compete&mdash;and this is the important fact. Our farmer is working his family farm and has his money tied up in the capital of that property in his stock and land. He has to compete with other countries. We ought to be a little more open-minded than we are with regard to the needs of our farmer and the important role he plays so far as our national economy is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that leading farm organisations within Australia say that farmers want to stand upon their own feet. But can farmers stand on their own feet when we find that other countries are dumping and supporting their farmers so much more financially? The farmer does not want a handout, but he does want to know that he has friends in the Government and the Opposition who are prepared to come to his aid if need be. If we are to compete fairly, assistance has to be there for the farmer. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the motion that the Senate take note of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation annual report, I must say that I have a pecuniary interest in the meat industry as a producer&mdash;and it is quite proper to tell the Senate about our pecuniary interests in different areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The meat industry is an important Australian industry both in the domestic market and the export market, predominantly in beef and sheep, in which the AMLC plays a key role. Its objectives of securing markets for our meat, both domestically and internationally, ensuring that the best possible marketing and transport strategies are utilised and providing appropriate support through market intelligence and other mechanisms, are, in my view, achieved in most cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, despite all the AMLC's best efforts to encourage Australians to eat more meat, we have a situation at present in Australia where drought and recession have affected our domestic production; slaughterings and consumption and a variety of other factors have impacted on our export levels; and domestically, sadly, as Senator Bjelke-Petersen said, Australians are eating less meat. Beef, veal and lamb have all lost market share and butchers are buying and selling less meat, which is rather sad. As I said, I have a pecuniary interest in producing good beef for people to eat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The domestic trade is worth some $2.6 billion, made up of fresh beef, veal, lamb, pork and poultry. Beef and veal and lamb both lost one per cent in market share to 53 per cent and 16 per cent respectively. The retail price of beef rose only 0.4 per cent and lamb actually fell by 4 per cent. This was despite the fact that Australian meat is among the cheapest and certainly the best quality meat in the world. This is all despite active effective advertising, slick promotion and increased awareness campaigns to encourage the housewife to buy more meat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The range of products now available for the health conscious shopper are outstanding. Lean beef and trim lamb are designed to appeal to the diet- and health-conscious family, and I believe butchers have faced the challenge of promoting their product in an admirable manner. Why then are Australians eating less meat? I am sure that I do not know the answer, and I hope the AMLC is working on a solution to that problem. That is very important to me and very important to Australia's meat industry, especially the beef industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I do know is that, nationally, we are slaughtering at high levels, particularly our females. Some 44 per cent of all slaughterings of our national herd are females. The herd is being run down. If this rate continues, we will have trouble meeting demand when the industry again takes off because we will be rebuilding the herd at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a producer, I am generally pleased with the prices I receive, but only insofar as they are often higher than the average. They are not higher than those I was receiving three or four years ago. In real terms some of my returns are no better than they were three or four years ago. One of the problems is that my returns are all dictated by the cost of slaughtering at the abattoirs and the penalty rates applying there. In addition, there is the cost of transport into the abattoirs and away to the butcher's shop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those things will be fixed with Fightback. When all that part of the chain is streamlined, transport will become cheaper, abattoirs will be more efficient and the killing costs will be lower. If one looks at AQIS and the cost of inspection charges in our abattoirs compared with what they are in the rest of the world, one discovers that ours are horrific. I know that the AMLC is just as concerned as I am about these inspection charges and costs. It is something that I hope the Corporation can get to the bottom of, but we will definitely get to the bottom of it when we win the next election, institute Fightback and achieve the efficiencies in the meat chain which are very necessary. I commend this report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the commencement of the installation of Fututech, semi-automatic cattle slaughtering equipment, into the abattoirs of the Kilcoy Pastoral Company is a major achievement designed to make a quantum leap in processing efficiency.

<PARA>After listening to Senator Brownhill, I feel sure that he is very interested in that also. At home we produce cattle as well and are always very interested in the ability to export cattle overseas. The Chairman further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Research funded by the Corporation has been largely responsible for adding significant value to our sheepskins for export over the past year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Research has also resulted in construction of plant designed to produce specially prepared meat for pizza outlets throughout South East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps the pizza outlets in Australia might be interested in that. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Corporation has a strong commitment to add value to meat and meat products in the areas of improving quality and the development of new products.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a commendable objective which we note on page 22 is given further attention when the report notes that the Corporation aims to help companies to create and market profitable meat products for changing demands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also aims to obtain commitments by 1993 from 10 to 12 meat companies to undertake new product development projects in which the companies fund at least 50 per cent of the cost of development. However, if the Government is to be serious about its wish to create a more friendly environment for producing value adding meat products, it should look to the handicaps that it is placing on the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My National Party colleague Mr Bruce Lloyd raised only a month ago the issue of the excessive bureaucratic red tape which is preventing the development of value added meat exports. Red tape requires that the health certificate cannot be prepared until the intention to export form is signed and the truck of meat sealed by an Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service inspector at the meat plant. It also has resulted in the fact that in cases where a simple typing error has appeared on the health certificate, it is rejected and must be retyped. A simple initialling of the changes on the document is not accepted. These unnecessary bureaucratic procedures must indeed be forcing companies to look at establishing businesses offshore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Often I have had the opportunity to speak in the Senate on the many issues relating to the Australian meat and livestock industries. Indeed, last year I congratulated the Corporation on the research work it has done into major areas affecting the industry both in the on-farm and off-farm sectors. I noted that the Corporation commissioned a number of research programs to service urgent industry needs. A number of them were designed to maximise the benefits for Australian producers and processors from the expanding Asian beef markets, to increase the volume of land going into the higher value domestic and export market, to increase the demand and price for Australian sheepskins and to increase the productivity of cattle and sheep by genetic engineering or rumen microbes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However fine and commendable these objectives are, I doubt there has been much success with them in the past year because, as all honourable senators know, there has been a dramatic turnaround in the fortunes of anyone associated with the Australian rural sector.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence of the lack of concern is no better demonstrated than by the Government's failure to provide funding last year to the University of New England to become a centre of cooperative research. That is something which definitely should have happened and something which would have provided world standard research into Australian meat production from the paddock to the plate. It would have helped the feedlot industry, which is expanding very quickly. It would mean that we would have to look at the palate of the people in the countries to which we were selling the meat. We would then come back and tell the producers exactly what was required to meet that market. That is the way we should be going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government failed to see the importance of the project and it stands condemned for that. Despite that the Meat Research Corporation still produced some very worthwhile results in meat and related research in the financial year under consideration. With an annual income of some $50m, it has achieved much with its key research programs in the past five years of operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During that time not all projects have produced the desired results. I will quote from page 11 some of the objectives and the results achieved, which sometimes did not quite meet what was required. For example, under `Improvement in Meat Yield and Quality', the objective there was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To reduce by 50 per cent the incidence of dark cutting and bruising in three selected abattoirs by 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>The result was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Partly achieved. Research is complete but adoption slow. The MRC work on cost sharing for bruising is now in place and should speed adoption.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are the sorts of things that have to happen and have to be speeded up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Its trials into on-farm processing of sheep to provide markets and products for surplus sheep proved to be non-viable and its trials into seeking value adding industries, much needed for our rural industries, have been partially successful. For example, efforts to increase tanning in Australia by 30 per cent were not quite reached. The figure of 20 per cent included tanned sheep products which, I have to say, look pretty smart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Page 31 of the report refers to the sheep skins key program and the goal is `to increase returns to the sheep producer by $2 on average per skin over and above inflation by 1996'. This will mean the difference between people being viable and not viable. It seems quite ludicrous to me that Australians are quite willing to pay $300 to $400 for an Italian leather handbag when the technology and quality of workmanship ought to be and can be available in Australia using Australian hides, with the economic benefits staying in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year, Mr Acting Deputy President, we had mention of National Wool Day in this Parliament. You might remember it&mdash;and, if you do not, you should. On that day, all National Party members and senators sat on quality lamb skins from Bowron in Blaney. I have one of those skins in my office now. They are something I think we can be justly proud of in this country. National Wool Day was just one way of showing the sort of quality that can be produced here in Australia. They are, frankly, quite magnificent skins.

<PARA>This strategy will help save 3,000 to 4,000 lives and prevent up to 150,000 casualties over the next decade. If it achieves that, it will definitely be achieving something really worthwhile in our community. It is interesting to note that the number of road deaths recorded for the last long weekend in New South Wales, for example, was reduced quite dramatically. But people are still speeding; people are still drinking and driving. It will not really matter what any national road safety strategy does unless we can educate the people to be a little more careful. Whenever one gets into a motor car one is playing with a very lethal instrument. People say that guns and rifles should be locked up.

I believe those people are playing with fire on the roads and that something should happen. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national road safety strategy is about effective cooperation between each level of government.

Every year about 2,500 people are killed and a further 30,000 are admitted to hospital as a result of road trauma. The fact that in the next decade one in 10 Australian families will be directly affected by a road death or serious injury is something that we in this chamber should take particular heed of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last 20 years, the safety of Australian roads has been improved. One could not say it has been improved absolutely consistently, but it has been improved despite almost a doubling of the amount of travel on the particular roads. The number of deaths has fallen from some 3,800 in 1970 to 2,300 in 1990 and 2,112 in 1991. As I have said, the figures for the most recent long weekend in New South Wales are better, but people are still driving at excessive speeds and people are still driving in an irresponsible manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key priorities of the national road safety strategy include alcohol and drug abuse, speeding and driver fatigue. Driver fatigue is something that has been taken up particularly in my home State and I think the education campaign has been quite successful in that people are beginning to recognise that when they are getting a bit tired it is better to pull to the side of the road and take a breather rather than to drive on, go to sleep and more than likely run into somebody else and cause one of the traumas I talk about. The other priorities are road hazards&mdash;a lot more effort has to be put into the roads&mdash;and heavy vehicles. Heavy vehicle drivers are now being much more responsible in their driving and are not driving when they are excessively tired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the coalition's Fightback proposals, the road industry will be the big winner. Conservative Treasury estimates demonstrate that the road transport industry will save up to $1.14 billion. That will be a great saving for people in the transport industry and it will mean that they will not have to hurry so much to make ends meet. I think that will be a great step forward in terms of making a national road safety strategy work properly. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of this report is to provide the details for the start of the process of rolling capital funds into university operating grants from 1994. Generally, this is to be welcomed as this new method of funding will increase institutional autonomy and place responsibility for resource management more fully into the hands of higher education institutions. However, the problem remains that the Government still does not go far enough in deregulating the higher education system. The plan outlined by the Government in this report means that the universities will still be hindered by the development of profiles and management reports which are an unnecessary drain on the resources of our universities. The Federal Government needs to accept the fact that higher education will meet the demands placed upon it only it if it is given the freedom and the autonomy to act so that it does not have to worry about government criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy outlined in this report also fails to address the problem of universities that are trying to catch up on inadequate capital funding over the past 10 years. The main concern relating to the catch-up and development is outlined in the summary of responses to the discussion paper sent out to the higher education institutions by the Minister. This also reveals concerns by the universities that the options outlined in the discussion paper do not allow for increased capital costs of emerging institutions such as the central coast campus of the University of Newcastle in my region. Concerns are also expressed about the timing of the roll-in, arguing that some institutions still have to catch up the phase of development that has occurred over the last 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A case in point is the University of Southern Queensland. This institution is an excellent example of the way in which higher education is heading in this country with its focus on open learning. It is apparent that it has received a raw deal in capital funding recently. It has been described as outrageous that USQ has not received its capital funding grant to enable it to build a technologies building despite previous assurances to the contrary by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The university missed out on capital funding in the 1980s through no fault of its own and, because of the incompetence of the Minister, it is about to miss out again. The people of southern Queensland should be outraged. This university is the only one in Australia to offer a degree in agricultural engineering and rural industry. It has already committed $1.1m to the end of 1993 for research. With sufficient capital funding, this research could be five times as much as that stated by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the USQ. The approach to capital funding is inconsistent with the value added industry and with allowing the young people of southern Queensland to reach their potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report that the Senate is now considering outlines a discretionary pool of funding that allows for capital development assistance to those institutions that are at a significant development stage, such as new campuses or those that are continuing to grow at extraordinarily high rates. However, absolutely no provision is made for universities such as the USQ, which have unfairly missed out due to the inadequate policies of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite this glaring gap in the report, the broad thrust towards greater autonomy for universities is to be welcomed. It is not really surprising to find that all institutions supported the capital role in concept and principle. Our higher education institutions have been demanding more autonomy and freedom when trying to raise revenue to finance these activities, so they can welcome this small but significant improvement. It is disappointing, however, that the Government has failed to see what nearly everyone else does&mdash;that is, that with financial freedom, the higher institutions in Australia would be flexible enough to meet the demands placed upon them. </PARA>

<PARA>I thank the Minister at the table, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) for his cooperation in this matter. However, I reiterate that the proper course of action would have been for the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) to put down a statement on this matter in both houses of this Parliament with the directions that he has issued to the senior bureaucrats in order that they might properly be debated rather than simply treated as papers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know why the Government decided to add these very serious matters to the bottom of the list of documents in the unusual way in which it has. However, we are certainly not going to allow that fact to remove from us our responsibility of dealing with these matters thoroughly. We are talking about an unprecedented event in the administration of justice in this country, which is the breakdown of communications between the chairman of the Australian Securities Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions to the extent that the administration of justice is not being properly carried out in relation to corporate crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember when this Government came into power that it accused us of being soft on corporate crime. It promised the Australian people that it would set up machinery to ensure that corporate crooks were properly brought to justice. What has happened is that the machinery the Government set up has totally broken down. There seems to have been a total absence of direction by the Attorney-General, the Minister responsible in this area, to ensure that the criminal law is properly applied in these instances of major corporate crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that Mr Hartnell, the chairman of the ASC, took it upon himself to allocate the resources basically towards regulatory functions of the ASC rather than criminal prosecutions. This came after we had been told that the 16 major corporate breaches or alleged breaches in particular, which were referred to as the big 16 cases, would be thoroughly investigated and that those who breached the law would be brought to justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But from what we were told by the Director of Public Prosecutions, we have learnt that Mr Hartnell orientated himself in a different direction, as a result of which the cases are not adequately being brought to the DPP's attention. According to the DPP, when cases are brought to his attention, there is insufficient evidence for a successful prosecution. Certainly a philosophical difference has become apparent between the DPP, who, not surprisingly, sees his responsibility as being to prosecute the cases that are brought to his attention, and the body that has the administrative responsibility for getting up cases, for accumulating the evidence and putting the brief to the DPP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the Minister doing whilst this philosophical breach was taking place between these two senior heads of these departments that could result in this breakdown? It seems that the Attorney-General was sitting on his hands. Basically, he did nothing until this matter came into the public forum. Sadly, it came into the public forum through leaks to newspapers and when these senior bureaucrats had laid their complaints before a parliamentary committee. That is not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister should have been taking action, not only to solve the philosophical difference between these senior bureaucrats but also to ensure that this conflict of view as to how these matters should be progressed should not be allowed to defeat the administration of justice in the way that it was. So the Minister not only did not get in and sort out the philosophical difference but he also did not take action to ensure that the administration of justice did not suffer as a result of this breach. It seems that this trouble has been brewing for some 12 months or so. It is simply not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the consequences of this breach? As I said a moment ago, we have been given these undertakings that, in relation to the big 16, adequate work was being done. But Mr Rozenes, the DPP, alleges that only one or two investigators are working on some of the big 16 cases. That will be ineffective, given the complexity of the matters. Mr Robinson, of the ASC, told Senate Estimates Committee E that in a significant number of these big 16 cases there had been referrals of breach to the DPP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who is telling the truth? Why is not the Minister getting to the bottom of this? Estimates Committee E was told that there had not yet been any convictions in any of the big 16 matters except in relation to the Bond matter. That is totally unsatisfactory and it is too late for the Minister to come before the Parliament and complain about it. I believe that a Senate committee ought to look at this total breakdown of the administration of justice, find exactly where the fault lies and do something positive about it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Very clearly, there was a conflict between those two law enforcement agencies which, I suspect, led to some of our corporate cowboys getting off scot-free and others perhaps being given a chance to get away with civil proceedings whereas they should have been criminally prosecuted. As one of the witnesses who gave evidence before the Joint Standing Committee on Corporations and Securities, which held a hearing on these matters, said, the only real deterrent for these corporate wrongdoers is not a fine but a stay in gaol. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation where there is an internecine conflict going on between the DPP and the ASC. It developed into a subterranean battle and it was only ultimately resolved by a very embarrassed and wrong-footed Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) when it became public. It became public because of the frustration of the two bodies leaking correspondence to the media to try to win a political point.

Of course, the war simply went on and the temperature went up. As I say, ultimately, out of embarrassment and discomfort, the Attorney-General brought them together and the battle continued in his office. He sent them away and put together some fairly elementary directions that they ought to take in the future.

<PARA>The letter that has just been tabled is dated 25 September. In the body of the letter, there is mention that the Ambassador who has signed the letter convened a meeting of the Australia-American Parliamentary Friendship Group on 16 September for the purpose of discussing with the leader of the delegation from Washington concerning agricultural matters Australia's objections to the way that the United States has extended the EEP scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This letter reiterated the point that all those present at that meeting on 16 September made quite clear that they did not accept the reason given by the United States for the extension of the EEP scheme. I think it is important to read some of the text of the letter in order to put it into context. The letter was written in response to a motion passed by the Senate regarding agricultural subsidies. The letter advises that the text of that resolution has been transmitted to Washington. His Excellency then said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take this opportunity to point out that the United States and Australia have entered into frequent bilateral agricultural technical consultations.</PARA>
<PARA>He then mentioned the meeting of the Parliamentary Friendship Group and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At that meeting, the leader of the U.S. Delegation . . . responded to questions from interested Parliamentarians for over one and a half hours. These questions were quite pointed regarding the use of export subsidies by the United States and the closeness of the relationship between the United States and Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We note that the Senate Resolution also calls upon the European Community to exercise moderation in the use of its export subsidies. As you are aware, the U.S. Export Enhancement Program is designed to force that outcome in the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round.</PARA>
<PARA>It was precisely that point&mdash;that is, the reason given for the extension of the EEP program&mdash;that the meeting on 16 September made quite clear that members of the Australia-America Parliamentary Friendship Group did not accept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we realise that this is an election year and that the Mid-West of the United States is an important voting section, we know from President Bush's speeches in those States that it is an election ploy. When we see Governor Clinton, who has pulled ahead in the polls, go into those same States and say, `The current administration has not done enough for you, we'll do more', we realise that we are getting into a Dutch auction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with the way this program is operating is that the subsidy is being paid, but we in Australia are being asked to bear part of the burden of that subsidy. The reason I say that is that because of the subsidy that the United States makes available, the price of wheat worldwide is lowered. There is no doubt that we will sell our wheat, but the price at which it will be sold will be lower than it would have been had there been no subsidy from the United States. Later in this debate colleagues of mine will deal very specifically with that question of price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I read an article in the press carrying comments by Mr Baker, who is now running President Bush's campaign, saying that Australians should stop whingeing about the export enhancement program and that it will do us no good if we just keep whingeing. The points that we make are based on more than just a simple whinge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis of the criticisms that we made at that meeting on 16 September, and continue to make, is that we do not accept that the EEP program is somehow designed wholly and solely to make the European Community come to the table to have a satisfactory round of the GATT. As these subsidies are paid, more and more American farmers become dependent upon them. That in turn affects the price of land, which in turn affects the size of mortgages, which in turn affects the banks which hold those mortgages. Every time an additional subsidy is paid the merry-go-round goes on and it becomes ever more difficult to wean those farmers off that scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very simple lesson is that if that subsidy were pulled away, there would be a detrimental effect on the price of land, on the servicing of those mortgages and on the viability of those banks. That is a real problem which has existed in the United States ever since the EEP program has been introduced or prior to that when people were being paid not to grow. The problem for us is that it affects the price we receive for our wheat. There can be all sorts of discussions about the fact that we produce better wheat than the Americans, and that they produce more wheat than we produce. The Americans say that they will take every opportunity to protect the interests of non-subsidising exporters such as Australia. I am again quoting the letter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, unless we have applying to our wheat a document equivalent to the Andriessen letter&mdash;a letter which applies with regard to the European Community and our beef&mdash;we could perhaps understand that there was some meaning in the undertaking given by President Bush to the farmers who demonstrated outside Parliament House when he was here last year and in subsequent statements. But in the meantime, if I can take up the point that Mr Baker made, it is not simply a matter of Australia whingeing. What the United States is doing with that program is making the subsidy an inbuilt part of the economy. The political will becomes harder each time that subsidy is made greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an election year in the United States, with President Bush making his commitment to farmers and then Governor Clinton starting to get into a Dutch auction by saying, `Anything he can do, we can do better and more', we see that the whole problem becomes greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as forcing the European Community to the table to find some satisfactory solution to the Uruguay Round of the GATT is concerned, it would be a fallacy if the United States convinced itself that somehow its action with subsidies had caused that to happen. One of the things that will force the European Community to come to any sort of accommodation with regard to the common agricultural policy is simply the financial difficulty that its member nations will get into with regard to the cost of expanding the CAP to cover lands within eastern Germany or other fallow lands which are presently not cultivated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that countries such as Australia and other countries in the Cairns Group continue to voice their opposition to, disapproval and strong non-acceptance of the fiction that has become the official reason for the expansion of the EEP scheme. I thought that at the meeting on 16 September there was an acceptance by the people in the United States delegation that we simply did not accept that reason as valid.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the letter that the President of the Senate received from Mr Mel Sembler, the Ambassador for the United States. I regret to say that I find the letter quite contemptuous in its offhanded brevity. It does not really address the issue of what damage is being done to Australian wheat farmers; nor does it hold out any hope at all that the United States is prepared to consider what it is doing and to change its ways. As has been previously stated by Senator Bishop, in a very lengthy and erudite exposition, it is quite clear that our farmers are going to suffer. And we can put it quite bluntly: they are being bankrupted. They are not being bankrupted because the United States has any hope of forcing the European Community to the negotiating table in the Uruguay Round but rather because President Bush is concerned about his re-election prospects in the United States. Anyone reading the newspapers in Australia or overseas would have to come to the same conclusion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This shedding of crocodile tears by the Opposition when it rejected a stronger action that was proposed in the Senate is really quite laughable. The notices of motion proposed by Senator Panizza and Senator Brownhill, amongst others, contained words such as `deplore', `condemn' and `abhor' in relation to the actions of the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I proposed a notice of motion suggesting that we should tell the United States that it was no longer welcome to share our defence facilities and that as long as it was not treating us as friends we were not prepared to treat the United States as a friend by allowing it to use its bases on Australian soil. In strategic terms they are of no use to Australia's security anyway. So why not make a statement to the United States that has some chance of real effect? I was delighted to see that Mr Malcolm Fraser, a former Liberal Prime Minister, had more courage than members of the Opposition in today's Parliament. He wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS> a week ago that the United States should have been told to quit the bases if it were not prepared to treat Australia as a friend and ally. Quite clearly, we cannot treat as a friend and ally a country that pays absolutely no heed to the damage it is doing to our wheat farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This behaviour will continue unless the Australian Government is prepared to tell the United States that we are not going to stand for that sort of behaviour. The Australian Government is unlikely to have the courage to do that unless it is supported by the Opposition. So I believe that it is time that we stopped making noises like a doormat, because if we do we will continue to be treated and trodden on like a doormat. We should state quite clearly and categorically that we have an interest in protecting our wheat farmers and that our Government should take action accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(9.54 p.m.)&mdash;I rise to support the motion to take note of the American Ambassador's response to the Senate's resolution of September. I think it should be put on record here that, whatever our discomfort, concern and disgust at the American export enhancement program to subsidise wheat sales into our traditional markets, one has to concede that the European Community is the No. 1 enemy of free trade that affects our agricultural production in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To use the term used by Mr Fischer, the Leader of the National Party, the Americans certainly should not be trade enemy No. 1 but should, I suspect, be trade enemy No. 2 in the list of priorities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it does not make it better, but at least the Americans announce when they are going to do it. The European Community makes no such announcement; it just happens. One has to admit that the Europeans have been doing these things longer and at a much greater rate, with effects on free trade and agricultural marketing, than have the Americans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be accepted that the Americans have responded to the European Community. In no way do I wish to reduce my criticism of the American initiatives in this area. The situation has certainly been brought about this year by the electoral consequences. President Bush can see his chances of re-election slipping away and Mr Clinton can see his chances growing. As the previous speaker said, both candidates are engaged in a Dutch auction. They want to grab some of the last few vital votes in the electoral college from the agricultural states of Mid-West America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I want to emphasise that our criticism from this Parliament and our No. 1 target is the European Community, and that our No. 2 target&mdash;not by a big margin&mdash;is the United States. We do not oppose America or the European Community giving income support to farmers, but we make a real distinction between that and production subsidies. If there are quite legitimate reasons in both countries, for social or economic reasons, to encourage people to stay on their land by giving them income supplements, then that is quite different from encouraging them to over-produce and sell those subsidised goods in our markets and thus affect world agricultural trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was not able to attend the recent meeting of the Australia-America Parliamentary Friendship Group, but when delegations from both the European Community and the United States have come before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the Committee has put to representatives of both countries that we support their right to seek income support for their people. But we find it absurd that the Americans spend tens of thousands of dollars, or even hundreds of thousands of dollars, giving income support to individual farmers. In the case of the European Community, they spend tens of thousands of pounds in a similar way in Great Britain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other night on television a British farmer was interviewed saying he was being paid #25,000 per annum to take about 40 acres of his 200 acres of land out of production. Even he thought it was a rort and an extraordinary waste of taxpayers' money. He favoured the free market system. But as Great Britain was part of the European Common Market he was paid to take that land out of production. In the end the taxpayers of the European Community will have to pay that extraordinary cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with previous speakers that it is not exactly a fulsome letter of defence of the American export enhancement program. I think the Senate was deserving of a more detailed letter in response to a resolution carried unanimously by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been interesting in Australia in the past month has been the various political responses to what the European Community and the Americans have been announcing. If 10 years ago someone had said that a former conservative Prime Minister of this country would suggest that as a penalty for the American trade decisions the position of the American-Australian joint facilities in Australia should be reviewed, most people would have thought that there was something wrong with the water one had been drinking. I never thought I would see the day when a former conservative Prime Minister would publicly state that, in view of the American position on trade, it is time the question of joint facilities be put on the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that a very odd coalition is emerging in Australia on this issue. On one side we have what one would call the extreme left of the political spectrum&mdash;an assortment of former members of the Communist Party, Trotskyites, general anarchists and so on, and people who are indirectly associated through the nuclear disarmament parties. These people, who are demanding the withdrawal of the joint facilities from Australia, are being joined by members of the various farming organisations who are now raising this issue. Members of the National Party are raising it. Of course, a former conservative Prime Minister, who in the 1950s and 1960s was noted for his extreme anti-communist views, his very strong defence of the so-called American alliance, is now openly suggesting that unless America changes its trade policies as they affect Australia, the position of the joint facilities should be reviewed in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an amazing coalition. The conservative Right and the extreme Left in Australia have a similar view about the action that should be taken against the United States. I do not believe that so far that view is the majority view in the Australian community. However, I recognise that if this debate continues it is inevitable that more and more of the Australian community in the mainstream of the two major political parties&mdash;my own Party and the Liberal Party&mdash;will also take views similar to what the former conservative Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, said recently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also part of the debate in the post-Cold War period is the role that the joint facilities should fulfil in respect of international affairs and strategic matters. I believe it is inevitable that there will be debate about their future in Australia. There should be a sound debate about their role in the international community of being able to assist in the international verification of weapons treaties and of monitoring developments around the world. For example, we all know that the joint facilities in Australia played a critical role in monitoring Scud missile attacks from Iraq on Israel. I think that is an absolutely defensible role for the joint facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I do not think we should automatically jump up and down on the trade issue and say that the joint facilities should go because we are getting hit over the head by the Americans on trade. There are wider international security issues at stake in the post-Cold War period that enhance the reasons the joint facilities should maintain in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Australian community will start reviewing the role of the joint facilities because they are no longer needed in purely Cold War terms. We all know that one of the two super powers&mdash;the Soviet Union&mdash;no longer exists. The President of Russia, Boris Yeltsin, was freely elected two years ago by the Russian people. I understand that he received more votes in that election than George Bush received in 1988. He is a freely and democratically elected President. So the Cold War which justified the joint facilities no longer exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do warn and caution those opposite, particularly people like Malcolm Fraser, that before we put our card on the table and say, `Unless you give us a break on trade it is out with the joint facilities', we ought to take a wider look at the role of the joint facilities. There are no longer three joint facilities. There are now two because North West Cape is an Australian facility. Nurrungar and Pine Gap have a role to play in international strategic matters, in monitoring and securing the so-called new world order international security arrangements. They have a role to play even in our own region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the frustration of some people. I am a bit bemused by Malcolm Fraser's frustration. When he was Defence Minister and when he was Prime Minister he did nothing other than defend in absolute terms the secrecy of the joint facilities. Now he says that they should be put on the table. I also say to those opposite, `If that is the only card you have to play, once you play it and nothing happens&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;People like Malcolm Fraser are saying that this ought to be the card we play to get a better trade deal. If we play that card the Americans might say, `All right, we are pulling out of the joint facilities. We are winding them up and removing them from Australia but we are not making any changes to our trade policies'. We will not have much left to play with thereafter if that is the only card we have to play.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that the blunt instrument approach that Malcolm Fraser on the right and some of the far Left&mdash;and not necessarily just the Democrats&mdash;are arguing is the best way to go about it. I think multilateral discussions are the best. I again emphasise that I believe the debate in Australia anyway should deal with the future of the joint facilities in the context of the new world order rather than just in the context of a trade debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I wish to comment on the Australian Government's response to the trade issue over the last month. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has quite rightly made it very clear that Australia's trade future in the total picture is within our own region of north Asia, east Asia and south-east Asia. Already 60 to 70 per cent&mdash;an ever increasing percentage&mdash;of our exports go to these regions. That should be the main game in town as far as our total trade picture is concerned. I think the very significant remarks made the week before last in Japan by our Prime Minister are a turning point in the debate in Australia about where our future lies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not mean to say that we should ignore any opportunity that emerges to improve our trade relations with other countries. It should be noted that we have a $6 billion trade surplus with Japan. I think we have almost a similar trade deficit with the United States of America. So, as far as trade relations with America are concerned, the US is doing very nicely out of us in the general trade picture irrespective of that country dumping wheat into our markets around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister spoke about the future role of APEC. I concede that Senator Bishop also made a similar point about the importance of APEC. I think we should welcome the indication from the Japanese that they support the Australian Government's view that there should be a meeting of APEC leaders, not just Foreign Ministers, to discuss trade and economic issues. This development is of considerable significance to the future trade prospects of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I believe it is important for the Senate to note and to comment on the letter from the American Ambassador. This is just one of many opportunities that senators have had formally and informally to express their views. We should continue to express them to the Americans. But we should also make sure that we never miss the opportunity to express them even, in many cases, more forcibly to European Community representatives who come to this country. I think the European Community is marginally ahead of the United States in terms of who is doing the most damage to us. I think that should be noted. I again emphasise that at least the Americans announce when they are going into our markets.

The EC has done the most rorting of trade and agricultural products. That is the No 1 priority. Not far behind&mdash;in the racing parlance, maybe only half a length behind&mdash;in the finish of the Melbourne Cup comes the Americans.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to refer to the letter from the United States Ambassador to the President following on from a notice of motion I gave some time ago, which motion was carried formally. We had a meeting with Mr Censky and the trade delegation that was out here. We were pretty lucky that we had that meeting; otherwise they would not have filled a quarter of a page, let alone the three-quarters of a page that they filled. All they referred to was that meeting. I attended that friendship meeting and I can tell honourable senators that it was anything but friendship. Mr Censky told us what they were doing: they were not attacking our market share; they were only going in where they thought the EC might have been going in. Even though Mr Censky said that he would leave our market share, he would not agree that what they were doing was depressing our prices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since Mr Bush made that announcement in North Dakota, South Dakota or wherever it was&mdash;incidentally, I was there a couple of years ago and took the chance to look at some of the farms, and some of the American wheat farms do not seem to be doing too badly to me, with their advanced equipment&mdash;the US started off with a subsidised sale of 220,000 tonnes of wheat to Pakistan, on the basis of a rumour that the EC was about to offer subsidy sales. Since to my knowledge the EC has not been in Pakistan with subsidised sales or any sort of sale, I would like to know where the rumour started. As far as I am concerned, it was probably started by a Pakistani wheat dealer. Pakistan is not a traditional EC market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht mentioned in his contribution, in damming the EC&mdash;and I agree that the EC is as much to blame as the United States in this matter&mdash;that at least with the United States you know when it is going to do a subsidy deal, whereas you do not know with the EC. All I can say about that is: what is the difference? If you get stabbed from the front or the back you are dead, anyway. You will not even live long enough to know whether you were stabbed from the front or the back. So I do not see Senator Schacht's point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the US has made a deal with India for one million tonnes of red wheat, valued at about $100m. Again, India is not a traditional EC market. The EC has not made a sale to India for five years. So, again, how can the US say that it is doing it because of the fear of subsidisation? They termed it a `pre-emptive strike'. Once again, is it on the basis of a rumour? Or is it just looking for market share? Mr Censky told us when he was here that he was not trying to get our market share; that he was only attacking the EC. But making a sale to India&mdash;a subsidised sale at that&mdash;has dampened the Australian potential to sell there. The Australian Wheat Board was hoping to make another sale in March. But from the reports I get from the Wheat Board and others at the moment, there is no way this can be done. As I said, earlier this year we made a sale of half a million tonnes of wheat to India. I cannot see how we can get to the next one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the point Senator Evans made today&mdash;that the subsidised sale to India was of red wheat. Red wheat is regarded as being of lower quality than the average quality of Australian wheat. Nonetheless, it is still wheat. Senator Evans admitted that the sale had a dampening effect on the price that Australia can get for its better quality wheat. It does not matter how much better quality wheat Australia wants to sell to India or anyone else; if there is someone around offering a subsidised sale, it brings our price down. When you get away from the top quality baking wheat, when you are selling red wheat or ASW&mdash;Australian Standard White&mdash;you are dealing with protein; that is all you are dealing with. So if you have a downward pressure on any protein product, you have it right across the board. That includes sorghum and corn. The US grows a lot of corn and Australia has an expanding corn industry. A big corn crop or a subsidised corn crop will also affect wheat. It will have a dampening effect because, after all, it is trading in protein. So I cannot see why because the US made that sale in red wheat to India it should be different from if it were white wheat or high protein wheat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cry of the US that it uses the EEP against the EC only is wearing a little thin in Australia now. Internal criticism is mounting in the United States because of the cuts in spending caused by these subsidies being paid out of Treasury to the wheat farmers rather than flowing to programs that badly need it. Hopefully, this matter will be settled when the election has finally come and gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seems to be a rumour amongst the press this year that subsidised sales as a result of Mr Bush's EEP are not going to affect price. The effects of subsidisation will not be any different to what happened two years ago. Leading up to harvest two years ago, we were looking at an estimated pool return of about $160 per tonne. At about the psychological time when the Australian Wheat Board was setting its estimate of the final pool return on which it does its borrowings, there were massive subsidised sales by the United States&mdash;up to $45 a tonne. What happened? That estimated pool return went down to about $115 a tonne, and that is where it remained. The fact is that private contracts were made in New South Wales, and probably southern Queensland and a few other places, on the basis of $160 a tonne, which the estimated pool return was going to be. They are the only ones who did any good out of the wheat crop of that year. The pool went back to $115, and that is where it stayed, and it was a disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year we were looking at an estimated pool return on the date that Mr Bush made his announcement&mdash;at least a month ago now&mdash;at around $160 a tonne, climbing to about $185 a tonne. That is normal. With the flush of the northern wheat harvest, the card price gets depressed. Normally, it gets down to about $150. But as the northern hemisphere places its wheat, the card price gradually rises. We are expected to get $185 by the end of this month. That would have set the pool return for this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The immediate effect of the Wheat Board's next appraisal was a drop of only $5 a tonne&mdash;back to about $155. But with the dampening effect of further sales to the likes of India, what is going to happen now? That is where it will stay. It will not have a hope of creeping towards $180 or $185. So much for the journalists who have a rumour around now that it will not affect the price. It is. It will have a total effect of at least $A30-$A35 a tonne, and that is the cream of the Australian wheat crop to the farmer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go further. It is not only farmers who are affected around Australia but also machinery dealers, storekeepers and people who want to expand their farms. All those people will be affected if there is, say, $35 to $40 a tonne less coming through to the farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask a few pertinent questions. There are people from whom we have not heard in this debate. I have heard what Mr Kerin, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, has had to say about this matter in the last month. I have not heard from Mr Crean, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy&mdash;a Minister from the trade union movement&mdash;and I was quite prepared to see what he could do in primary industry development. We have heard very few constructive comments from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the situation. These people have been conspicuous by their silence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time that the United States treated us as an ally in the same way that we have been an ally to it for the last 50 or 60 years.

If we throw on the table that the Americans ought to pull out of Australia, they might take the idea up and be happy to go. We can work around this, but I do not want people such as Mr Sembler, Mr Bush or Mr Censky coming to Australia and telling us that they are not affecting our industry. They are affecting it, and they are being hypocritical about it in their statements and platitudes. There are ways to do it; the Australian Government should be more pro-active in getting us to where we ought to go. </PARA>

To say that the Americans came away with an attitude that Australian members of parliament from all sides were anything other than extremely concerned and annoyed that this is happening is a fairly minor understatement.

This gentleman had the audacity to say to us that it was our primary producers, our wheat growers, who were being subsidised and not the US growers.

To get to that figure I understand they had to take into consideration the amount that we pay for things like research and development, marketing and things like that&mdash;not money that the growers actually receive but money that the growers were contributing so that they could improve their industry. That was in comparison to a 44 per cent subsidy rate to the US wheat producer. Even going on the US figures, they are massively subsidised, well ahead of us.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to correct a mistake that I made during the Estimates Committee E hearings. During early September in the central west of New South Wales there was a debate raging in several newspapers about hospital privatisation. The combatants were the local State MP, Mick Clough; Dr Bruce Shepherd; Mr Russell Schneider of the Australian Health Insurance Association; and Mr Jeff Riley, the Chief Executive Officer of Dudley Private Hospital. In the course of the debate it was revealed that the State member of parliament was apparently in a private health fund. This had nothing to do with the debate and appeared to involve a gross invasion of privacy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During Estimates Committee E hearings, I asked several questions of officers of the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services about whether they had any idea how anyone could find out the health insurance status of another individual. At the time I did not have the appropriate newspaper cuttings before me and I alleged that it was Mr Russell Schneider who had made the allegation. This in fact was incorrect and the allegation is reported as having been made by the Chief Executive Officer of the Dudley Private Hospital, Mr Jeff Riley. I apologise to Mr Schneider for incorrectly attributing the allegation to him and seek leave to have incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a letter from him advising me of my mistake and of his strong view that the privacy of individuals should be respected. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I read with interest and some concern the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Senate Estimates E Committee, page 237, on 18 September 1992 wherein you, as Chairman, were reported as saying that I had made comments about the health insurance status of a State Member of Parliament. I do not recall having spoken to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Western Advocate</EMPHASIS> newspaper but do recall speaking to a representative of a newspaper in the Lithgow area, which I believe is covered by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Western Advocate</EMPHASIS>, in relation to comments made about health insurance by the State member, Mr Clough. The reporter concerned rang me seeking my response to comments made by Mr Clough which were highly critical of health insurance generally. I responded appropriately in relation to Mr Clough's comments. At no time did the reporter ask me about Mr Clough's insurance status nor at any stage in the conversation did I make reference to it.</PARA>

I have not been able to locate any article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Western Advocate</EMPHASIS> to which you referred but I have obtained a copy of an article which was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lithgow Mercury</EMPHASIS> on 6 September 1992.

If you read the article (attached) you would find that there was a reference to Mr Clough's insurance status but that that reference was made&mdash;not by me&mdash;but, according to the report, by the Executive Officer of a local private hospital who is a person not known to me and with whom I have never had any contact.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter I raise tonight is similar to one I have raised previously: the issue of freedom of religion and, in particular, of Buddhists to practise their religion in Vietnam. As I said before, I have raised incidents where monks have been imprisoned; I have raised the question of the return of Buddhist property to the Buddhists in Vietnam. I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) has previously made representations in relation to events which have occurred, and I want to ask him to again make representations to the Government of Vietnam on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two recent incidents to which I wish briefly to refer. The first is the death of a 25-year-old monk, the Venerable Thich Thien An. He resided at Thien Minh pagoda, Thu Duc, Saigon. He was taken by the Government, imprisoned and tortured. He died in prison in late September of this year, and the Government then spread the word that he had committed suicide. Nobody who knew him believes that. They know that he was taken; they know that he was imprisoned&mdash;he was not brought to trial; and they know that he was tortured. He was a young man who was very committed to what he was doing&mdash;learning and practising Buddhism. He was very dedicated to the work that he was carrying out in that capacity. From what I know of the incident, there seems to be good reason to believe that he was in fact killed by the authorities in prison, as suggested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just last week two monks were charged on the quite extraordinary pretext of illegal driving and were imprisoned. It happened at 11.30 a.m. on 2 October 1992 at Mac Thi Buoi Street, First District of Saigon. Arrested were two officials of the United Vietnamese Buddhist Congregation, the Very Venerable Thich Khong Tanh and the Venerable Thich Tri Luc. In this there is some significance in that the Venerable Thich Khong Tanh was imprisoned in the year 1976 by the then communist government of Vietnam. He had at that time written to the communist Prime Minister protesting against the order to call up young Buddhist monks for military service. It was seen by the church at that time as one of the steps designed to destroy the Buddhist clergy. For that, he was imprisoned for some considerable time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just last week, as I said, he and his companion were arrested for a driving offence. To be arrested and imprisoned in this fashion for a driving offence seems, at least to me, absolutely extraordinary. But later the same day at about 8 p.m., the police went to the Lien Tri pagoda in the Thu Duc district where the Venerable Khong Tanh resided. They searched and took a number of documents from the place&mdash;documents which had been prepared and signed to be sent out to the domestic Vietnamese congregations and to overseas congregations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we are entitled to ask when there will be freedom to practise Buddhism in Vietnam. It seems a great pity that this sort of persecution is continuing. Religious freedom does not exist in Vietnam; torture and the killing of monks is continuing; and the property of the church has not been restored to its rightful owners. I think there is serious infringement of human rights going on, from what I hear. I hope that the Minister will again make representations, through the Australian Embassy in Vietnam to the authorities there, protesting about this and making it plain that this is behaviour that we do not appreciate or support. The Buddhists in Vietnam have been there for a very long time and are very much a part of the history of that country. It seems to me impossible for Vietnam to again take its place in the world and say that it is a free country while this sort of persecution continues. </PARA>

This document was first made public when I tabled in this chamber a copy of the fourth draft on 26 May 1992. It was finally released for public comment&mdash;I might add, after secret consultation with State and Territory governments&mdash;in July 1992, and the deadline for public submissions was 7 September 1992.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, I seek leave to table a letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) from a coalition of conservation groups, including the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Wilderness Society, which outlines their concerns about this document. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This document represents the views of some 400,000 Australians who are expressing their concerns about the draft national forest policy statement. As the document has been tabled, I do not intend to waste honourable senators' time by repeating the comments contained within it, but rather I point to the sort of development that is envisaged by the governments that were privy to the negotiation of this agreement&mdash;and the Government of my own State of Western Australia was one of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent publicity in Western Australia has highlighted the plans of that State's Government to promote the construction of a large scale pulp mill in that State. I refer to a copy of a prospectus recently released by the Western Australian Department of State Development. This glossy prospectus reveals yet again the failure of both the Federal and</PARA>
<PARA>Western Australian governments to put into practice the principles of ecologically sustainable development that they so publicly proclaim. They appear instead to be blinded by the desire to produce jobs at any cost and, as one conservationist has aptly remarked, they are engaged in a destruction led economic recovery.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the conservation movement stated in its letter to the Prime Minister, we need instead a forest policy with two elements, the first of which was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A native forest protection policy which will protect all the diversity, wilderness and aesthetic qualities of Australia's remaining native forests. It would include the immediate cessation of logging in high conservation value forests, the identification of areas requiring further study over which moratoria would apply and the timetable for the eventual transition of all logging to alternative plantation sources.</PARA>
<PARA>This particular strategy has been recommended by the Resource Assessment Commission and is ignored by the draft national forest policy statement. The second element cited was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A wood production strategy based on existing and additional plantations on already cleared land. This can also encompass programmes aimed at land regeneration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such an approach would provide for job growth, meet Australia's timber needs and protect Australia's unique native forest heritage.</PARA>
<PARA>I therefore urge the Government to scrap this draft national forest policy statement and commence a process of open consultation with all sectors of the community to produce a new forest policy that is consistent with the principles outlined by the conservation movement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to speak in the adjournment debate on a document which was tabled in the Senate earlier this evening when the debate took place on the High Court decision with regard to the ad ban Bills. This document incorporated by Senator Faulkner is titled the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Campaign Committee Report</EMPHASIS> and was presented by myself when I was chairman of the National Farmers Federation marginal seat strategy campaign committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it was incorporated in such a way as to endeavour to discredit myself and, in particular, discredit Mr Andrew Robb, who at that time was the executive director of the National Farmers Federation. It was incorporated in such a way as to make it appear that it was some secret document which had fallen off the back of a truck or been obtained in a like manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make the record absolutely clear that it was part of a public report given by myself to the NFF conference in about November 1987. I have not been able to establish the exact date. There are some points in it that I wish to comment on in particular. However, I want to make it quite clear that at the time it was a public document which was discussed openly, reported on by the press at the time and, in fact, both myself and the current member for Barker in South Australia, Mr Ian McLachlan, both talked to the press about it. There was nothing secret whatsoever about the document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document is quite instructive when one looks at it and notes some of the points that were made at that time. The points in it that I want to comment on are the position that was adopted then by the National Farmers Federation, and in particular myself because I was the chairman of that committee. There was total opposition to a consumption tax and any other increase in indirect taxation. We supported the removal of excises from petroleum products, reintroduction of an effective income equalisation deposit scheme and, finally, a campaign of opposition to the Government's industrial relations Bill, which I will come back to shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Senator Faulkner's comments tonight he was casting an aspersion on myself that my position in terms of the Opposition's current policy with regard to taxation is somehow or another at odds with the position that I adopted at that time. I want to make the point very, very clearly that what I was opposing at that time was option 3 of what was then known as the Paul Keating consumption tax presented at the Tax Summit in 1985, if I remember correctly. At that time the National Farmers Federation, including myself, opposed very vigorously, as did most other members of the community, the introduction of that particular consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of reasons why that was done. The main opposition related to the fact that it was dealing with only one aspect of the taxation system and there were a number of exemptions and a `picking of winners' component in those proposals. Now, when trying to relate that to the current position of the Opposition, one needs to highlight the very significant differences in terms of the position that the coalition now has and which it is presenting to the Australian public. The most notable things in terms of the change&mdash;and I will not go into the details of option 3 because it is well and truly on the public record for all to read&mdash;is that our position is that we have the total abolition of the wholesale sales tax, the total abolition of payroll tax, the total removal of excises from petroleum products and a number of other initiatives in terms of the taxation system, particularly with regard to the training levy and other points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very, very different proposal from the one we were dealing with then. Of course, the coalition's proposal was not brought forward until July 1990. How Senator Faulkner can sit over there and carry on like he does in terms of what the position is&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already said that. If the Senator would sit down and listen he might learn something. Also at that time tariff tax reform was not high on the agenda. That has been significantly advanced. I do not see the relevance of this report in terms of the ad ban Bill. I am not quite certain why it was put down, but nonetheless it has been. Senator Faulkner is trying to relate the position in terms of option 3 to the current position that the Opposition has with regard to the reform of the taxation system, including a 30 per cent cut in income tax which is also very significant and important as far as taxation reform is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I wanted to raise tonight which is even more significant is the campaign and notice of opposition to the Government's industrial relations Bill. It is appropriate that I remind this chamber and the Australian public of the position of the Government at that time and the position it would love to be in today. That legislation was to introduce a labour court as part of the Hancock committee report and to remove sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. That was the Government's position at that time and if it thought it had half a chance, it would follow that course again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One must emphasise here the enormous importance of sections 45D and 45E in terms of giving justice in the industrial arena in Australia. They are the provisions which allow people to protect themselves against secondary boycotts wherever those secondary boycotts may come from. They are a very important part of law in this country today. At that time the Bill was also about removing industrial disputation from the law courts of Australia and, as I have already said, putting them under a labour court. This meant that if people were subjected to industrial action they did not have full access to the normal laws of the land. In other words, it was creating selective law separate from the laws of the land for privileged people who thought that, by what is commonly known as the abuse of union power, they could run this country through industrial action. It was going to separate them from the Federal Court, the supreme courts of the various States, the High Court and from the judicial appeals tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth noting here that both 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act were amendments introduced by the Fraser Government. The judicial appeals tribunal was also established as a result of legislation brought into this place by the Fraser Government, the last Liberal Government of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times we have seen, for example in the Contractors Bill, that a commercial contractor who has a legitimate legal contract can be forced to appear before the Industrial Relations Commission to have that commercial contract interfered with. That is just an extension of what the Government was endeavouring to do at that time. For Senator Faulkner today to incorporate these in the ad ban debate defies reason. Nonetheless, he has sought to do so. To try to compare the position of Paul Keating's option three in the May 1985 Tax Summit to the position of the Opposition today, and in particular to my position, is misleading and mischievous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this Government thought it could introduce legislation providing for a labour court and get it through this chamber and if it thought it could remove from the provisions those people who take industrial action and abuse people in this community, it would not only bring in the labour court and have Caesar judging Caesar, but would also remove sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on some issues that I think should be aired in the Parliament relating to some developments with the Australian Democrats and their behaviour towards this Parliament. Today we had two examples of the Australian Democrats voting with the Government to restrict the rights of senators to make Ministers more accountable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only did the Democrats vote in Question Time substantially to restrict the rights of senators to question Ministers, but they also joined with the Government to effectively limit another very important procedure which has developed in the Thirty-sixth Parliament. I refer to the procedure of taking note of answers after Question Time. This enables this chamber to debate answers given by Ministers during Question Time and in that albeit small but important way help make Ministers more accountable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues I wish to raise tonight relate first of all to the general voting record of the Australian Democrats. I think it is important to see how the Australian Democrats have been able to succeed or otherwise in their attempt to hold themselves out as honest brokers in this chamber. The other issue I wish to raise relates to the willingness of the Australian Democrats to discourage the abilities of senators to debate Bills which come before this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is true that certainly out in the public arena the Australian Democrats like to portray themselves as playing the issues fairly, as trying to encourage both sides of the chamber to debate more effectively the issues which come before this chamber. They would certainly reject the view of Senator Loosley, who put it rather well when he said, `I have always preferred to think of the Democrats as seeking to carve out for themselves a position in Australian politics as being the fourth faction of the Australian Labor Party, some group off to the left in a Labor Government'. I think in some ways that is correct.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought it would be of interest to honourable senators, and I hope the Australian public, to look at the voting record of the Australian Democrats in the Thirty-sixth Parliament, firstly under the leadership of Senator Powell and more recently under the leadership of Senator Coulter. I have had a table prepared which ascertains just how often the Australian Democrats have voted with the Government, how often the Australian Democrats have voted with the Opposition and how often they have split from both the major groupings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This table shows that since the last election the Australian Democrats voted with the Government&mdash;this excludes of course the number of very important divisions which occurred today; these figures are up to 17 September&mdash;on 216 occasions, and voted with the Opposition on 34 occasions. Any attempt by the Australian Democrats to portray themselves as somewhat even-handed, as a party which is playing the issues, is greatly undermined by these figures. In fact, it is very clear from these figures that, on many of the important issues which come before this chamber on which the chamber decides to divide and take a formal vote, the Government has been able to receive the support of the Australian Democrats on 216 occasions, whereas the coalition has received their support on 34 occasions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other matter I wish to raise relates to a very important and fundamental issue; that is, how this Parliament debates the legislation which comes before it and whether senators have the capacity to properly consider the Bills which are being brought before this chamber. It is interesting to examine the figures&mdash;I have figures going back to 1972&mdash;and to look at the number of times Bills have been guillotined through this chamber and at the performance of various governments to see how they have managed their business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans will undoubtedly be interested in the fact that during the three years of the Whitlam Government the total number of Bills which were guillotined through the Parliament was 61. In the seven years of the Fraser Government, a total of 57 Bills were guillotined through the Parliament. Then we come to the Hawke and Keating governments and look at their ability to manage government business. We find that over the period since 1983, some 217 Bills have been guillotined through the Parliament. When we look at the ratio in recent years, particularly since 1990 which is the period of the Thirty-sixth Parliament, we see that well over 100 Bills have been guillotined through the Parliament in the two and a bit years since the last election. These Bills have been able to be guillotined through the Parliament because of the support given by the Australian Democrats to the use of the guillotine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite interesting to look back at what former Senator Michael Macklin said about a similar issue&mdash;the need for legislation to be properly considered by the Senate, given the pretty cursory examination that often occurs in the other place. Senator Evans will know that former Senator Macklin developed the so-called Macklin rule which prevented the other place from dumping legislation into the Senate at the last moment&mdash;in other words, trying to force Bills through the Senate without proper consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macklin spoke to his motion, which contained a cut-off date for the presentation of Bills to the Senate. It is probably worth recording in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> what former Senator Macklin said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is very much in the interests of the bureaucrats within departments to find particular reasons why a Bill's drafting is not actually finished or why the directions the Minister has given have not been able to be followed. If this happens, lo and behold the Bill cannot really be available until almost the end of the sitting in which case the hope is that this chamber, having run out of time, will give it a speedy passage and nobody will scrutinise it much . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Macklin went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This chamber should take some retaliatory action with regard to the operation of using this chamber to dump the stuff in and move it through with no opportunity for debate.</PARA>
<PARA>The old style Democrats, in the days of Senator Macklin, argued that it was very</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In summary, by guaranteeing the Government the passage of all its legislation through the use of the guillotine, the Australian Democrats are defeating their intention, as expressed in the Macklin rule, to require more adequate consideration of legislation which comes before this chamber. I have pointed out two particular areas this evening. I believe that the behaviour of the Australian Democrats is negating their rule to try to act as honest brokers and certainly negating any principle they hold that it is absolutely vital that honourable senators be given the maximum opportunity to examine legislation which comes before this chamber. It is important that the public realise just what attitudes the Australian Democrats are adopting under their new leader, Senator Coulter.</PARA></TALK.START>

At one stage during the debate the Australian Democrats called for a judicial inquiry into the whole Marshall Islands affair. Subsequently, an idea was developed by the Government that perhaps the best answer to the many issues which were exposed during the Marshall Islands affair was to discuss a code of ethics for Ministers. I have to say to Senator Evans that, amongst the many failures which litter his career, his ability to convince the Australian Democrats to avoid an inquiry by having a discussion on a code of ethics for Ministers must rate as one of his successes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even for a man with a very long career but with his future behind him, we have to concede that to convince the Australian Democrats that the discussion of a code of ethics for Ministers was almost the same, if not quite the same, as having a full inquiry into the Marshall Islands was some minor achievement on Senator Evans's part.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to whether there should be a proper inquiry, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> indicated that a majority of Democrat senators, some five in all, were in favour of a full inquiry and that three were opposed to it. I do not know who the three were; perhaps that can be revealed at some later stage. Senator Coulter then decided that the vote of three to five meant that the Democrats would not be supporting any proper inquiry into the Marshall Islands affair. So much, I suspect, for the much flaunted independence of the Australian Democrat senators and their much flaunted principle to make governments more accountable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I raise these matters on what I think is a rather sad day. The Australian Democrats have moved to greatly inhibit the major reforms which had taken place in relation to Question Time and to return Question Time to the bad old days. They did this to confirm their view that it was important to restrict the rights of senators to take note of answers after Question Time. In order to fill out the picture of the approach that the Australian Democrats are now taking, it is worth recording the way that they have voted during the Thirty-sixth Parliament and their willingness to negate the Macklin rule and encourage the Government to bring forward as many Bills as possible to be guillotined through the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) All submissions on Draft Environmental Impact Statements (EIS's) prepared in accordance with the Commonwealth Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 are public documents unless an author specifically requests that a submission remains confidential. The Airport Co-ordinating Task Force did not ask that its submission on the Sydney Airport third runway Draft EIS remain confidential and therefore the Coopers and Lybrand cost benefit study, which formed part of the Task Force's submission, is a public document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) I am aware of the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research (NIEIR) study which included an assessment of the employment benefits of alternative airport developments in the Sydney Region. From the NIEIR study and work associated with the EIS's for Badgerys Creek and the Third Runway it is clear that only a directed development of a major international airport at Badgerys Creek would generate substantial employment growth in that Region. Such a development would not be commercially viable at this time and most of the employment growth at Badgerys Creek would be at the expense of other regions of Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Federal Airports Corporation Regulations establish a licensing regime to ensure that contractors working at the Sydney Airport third runway construction site and dredging sites in Botany Bay comply with environmental standards. These standards are a direct outcome of the environmental assessment process. Because the EIS on the third runway was prepared in accordance with Federal environmental assessment legislation (Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974) and not State legislation, the Regulations are intended to remove any doubt about the extent to which NSW laws apply to the construction of the runway.</PARA>
