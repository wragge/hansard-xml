<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) (Modifications of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1991 No.397, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 27 February 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations modify many provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 in its application to the Australian  Capital Territory under the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 32.2 of the Schedule modifies the Act to provide that a person who either does not reply to a "please explain" notice from the Divisional Returning Officer for failing to vote in an election or whose explanation for not voting is not accepted by that officer, may opt either to pay $20 to the Electoral Commissioner or have the matter determined by the Magistrate's Court where the maximum penalty is $50 plus costs. These provisions are set out in Form G in the Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similar provisions were provided in the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1989 No.186, which originally introduced these provisions. The Committee wrote to the then Minister on 29 August 1989 pointing out that the Form does not advise that if a person opts to pay the $20, that not only does that discharge any liability and ensure that no further proceedings can be brought, but also, of special importance, that the elector is not to be regarded as having been convicted of an offence. This is a very significant provision which should receive the widest publicity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 3 November 1989 the Committee received a very helpful letter from the Minister, which advised that he agreed with the Committee and undertook to take administrative action to ensure that the full safeguards were brought to the attention of those affected. The Minister also attached a draft amendment of the Form.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that the present Form should include notification of the full protection for the individual which the Regulations properly provide. This should preferably be done in large and bold type.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the Regulations apply to the recent Australian Capital Territory elections your advice would be appreciated as to the action proposed to inform voters of their rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely,</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Giles</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 28 February 1992, concerning the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral)(Modifications of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918) Regulations. I note your Committee's views on the need to include certain additional material on the Notice sent to apparent non-voters by the Australian Electoral Commission, in order to fully inform such electors of their rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While Regulation 32 of the Regulations specifically provides the rights accruing to the elector on payment of the penalty concerned, I agree with the Committee's views on this matter and have been advised that the sentence conveying the information concerned was inadvertently omitted from the Notice (Form G) during the preparation of the Regulations in late 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am also advised that the Australian Electoral Commission wishes to ensure that all electors concerned are fully informed of their rights. The Commission has undertaken to include in all of the `penalty' Notices in question, a note in bold type, informing apparent non-voters that payment of the penalty of $20 not only discharges any liability, but ensures that no further proceedings can be brought and that the elector will not be regarded as having been convicted of an offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the passage of the Australian Capital Territory Self Government Legislation Amendment Act 1992, the Regulations mentioned above will remain in force only until the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly enacts its own electoral legislation. In view of the limited life of the Regulations, I believe it would be appropriate to proceed on the basis of the Electoral Commission's undertaking, rather than to seek to formally amend the Regulations. I trust that this solution is acceptable to the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to Guidelines HSB 3/1992 made under s.82F of the National Health Act 1953, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 5 March 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause (c)(1) provides that appointments of the Commissioner, other Members and Deputies to the Private Health Insurance Administration Council under s.82B of the Act shall be at the pleasure of the Minister, except that any appointment shall be deemed to expire after three years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The earlier Guidelines No.1 of 1989 also provided that appointments shall be at the pleasure of the Minister. However, the Committee now considers that removal of appointees should only be made for proven misbehaviour or physical, mental or other forms of incapacity. This is because the professional reputations of persons could suffer if they were removed without reasons. In addition, if appointees could be removed at the pleasure of the Minister then this could compromise the independence of the advice given by such appointees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee raised this same issue in respect of the first set of Therapeutic Goods Regulations, Statutory Rules 1990 No.88. Those Regulations provided that the Minister may "remove a member (of certain statutory committees) from office at any time". The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services undertook to amend this provision to meet the concerns of the Committee, which he did in the second set of Therapeutic Goods Regulations, Statutory Rules 1990 No.394. The relevant regulation now provides that the Minister may remove a member for misbehaviour, physical or mental incapacity, bankruptcy or imprisonment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee asks whether you could undertake to amend the Guidelines to provide for similar objective criteria to guide and limit the exercise of the power.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 established the National Industrial Chemical Notification and Assessment Scheme. The Act establishes a national system of notification and assessment of industrial chemicals which, among other things, aids in the protection of the Australian people and the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Government introduced the Scheme, it decided that the regulatory impact on industry be reviewed after two years of operation. This Review is currently in progress. This is known as the Regulatory Impact Review. I anticipate further amendments arising from this Review, aimed at minimising the regulatory impact of the Scheme on industry to the extent that this is consistent with the maintenance of adequate safeguards for workers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill presents a small but significant amendment to the Act. It addresses one aspect of the legislation of particular concern to industry because of its impact on product development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill amends the Industrial Chemicals (Notifications and Assessment) Act 1989 to allow for the introduction of new industrial chemicals for the sole purpose of commercial evaluation. New industrial chemicals introduced for this purpose are to be exempt from the assessment provisions of the Act. This means that importers and manufacturers may evaluate the commercial potential of a new industrial chemical without having to invest resources in preparing the detailed notification package covering the chemical's physical and chemical properties and toxicology which is currently required. The Bill enhances innovative product development by significantly reducing regulatory requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides that new industrial chemicals introduced for the sole purpose of commercial evaluation have to be notified to the Director of the Scheme and that information on occupational health, public health and environment protection is provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proposed section 21A deals with the object of the commercial evaluation permit system. The object is to provide a simple means of by-passing the assessment certificate system where a new industrial chemical is being introduced for the sole purpose of commercial evaluation while ensuring that adequate safeguards are imposed. One safeguard is the provision of a Material Safety Data Sheet to the Director of the Scheme. This specifies any health hazards that could be caused by the chemical, the manner of handling the chemical and procedures to be adopted in the event of any emergency involving the chemical.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another safeguard is to be found in Clause 6 of the Bill which subjects chemicals introduced for commercial evaluation purposes to the priority existing chemical provisions of the Act. These allow for the chemical to be assessed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides that chemicals introduced under a commercial evaluation permit would normally be introduced for a period of one year only and in quantities not exceeding 1000 kilograms and must be used for the sole purpose of commercial evaluation. There is facility to increase the amount up to 2000 kilograms and for a period up to 2 years where the Director is satisfied that the increased quantity and the increased time is necessary for an effective commercial evaluation. The Bill also includes a power to impose conditions and a power to revoke or vary any condition on permits granted to allow for commercial evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a significant penalty for a breach of the conditions on which a commercial evaluation permit is granted. As confidentiality may be an important consideration in new product development the Bill allows an applicant the right to apply for certain information to be granted confidential status.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The needs of industry are met because a manufacturer or importer of a new industrial chemical will be permitted to test the chemical with a view to ascertaining its potential for commercial application without the regulatory burden of having the chemical fully assessed. If the evaluation indicates that the chemical has a commercial market then the importer or manufacturer can make an informed decision whether it is worthwhile to apply to have the chemical notified and assessed as a new chemical. In this way the Bill will remove some of the commercial risks currently associated with product development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The passage of the Bill will show the strength of the Government's commitment to reducing the regulatory burden on industry. The Bill provides an easy and cost effective way for Australian industry to extend existing markets and create new markets. By minimising the regulatory cost of developing and improving products, while maintaining safeguards the Government is determined to create a regulatory climate which will foster industry development. This will assist in achieving the Government's micro-economic reform goals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In canvassing the need for the commercial evaluation category in the Act the Government has consulted widely. It has consulted with relevant Commonwealth, State and Territory agencies as well as the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Chemical Confederation of Australia, The Australian Chemical Industry Council, their affiliates, other industry associations not affiliated with these peak bodies, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and interested non-government organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All parties support the amendment. Industry have sent a clear message that the new category will have benefits flowing from it. These include a proper consideration of possible risks to health and environmental matters and removal of a restraint to innovation and trade.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to authorise a contribution of $A350 million towards the Fifth Replenishment of the Asian Development Fund (ADF).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contributions to the ADF are one of the largest single items in Australia's official development cooperation  program. As such the size of payments can have a significant impact on other components in the program. A $350 million contribution represents an appropriate balance that will enable Australia to continue playing a significant role in the Asian Development Bank while allowing financial flexibility in the rest of the development cooperation program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ADF is the concessional lending arm of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The Bank provides roughly one third of its loans on concessional terms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Asian Development Bank is a major international development agency. It is owned by the governments of thirty-six countries from the Asia Pacific region and sixteen countries from Europe and North America. The Bank provides financial support for development activities in its medium and low income developing member countries in the Asia Pacific region. Access to the ADF is confined to the poorest developing member countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In twenty-six years of operations, the ADB has become a major catalyst in promoting the development of the most populous and fast-growing region in the world today. The ADB's operations cover almost the entire spectrum of economic development, with particular emphasis on agriculture, energy, capital market development, transport and communications and social infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ADF was established in 1974 and Australia has participated in the previous four replenishments of the ADF. Participation in the ADF has been an efficient means of achieving aid delivery to the poorest countries of the Asia Pacific region. ADB activities also complement our bilateral aid to PNG and the South Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Traditionally, the terms on which ADF loans are made are very favourable:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Loans are repaid over a period of up to 40 years</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">repayment begins only after a period of 10 years</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">per cent on their loans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general, only countries below a per capita GNP of $US860 (in 1990 dollars) may be considered as eligible for ADF resources. ADF borrowers are thus among the poorest countries in the world. They face serious constraints in building their economies and alleviating poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is currently the second largest regional donor to the ADF, after Japan, and the fourth largest overall. Since the inception of the ADF, Australia has pledged an average 6.1 per cent of total funds. As a major shareholder of the Bank and contributor to the ADF, Australia plays a significant role in formulating the Bank's policies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the replenishment negotiations, the donors to the ADF set policy guidelines for the Bank on the use of ADF-6 funds. These policies include focusing on poverty alleviation, the role of women in development, cooperation with non-government organisations (NGOs) and the environment. Development of the private sector is also a major policy aim of the Bank and the ADF.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have come to regard the achievement of economic growth without corresponding poverty alleviation as unbalanced. In the ADB, poverty issues are now systematically considered when designing development strategies for member countries. An increasing number of projects and programs is aimed at meeting specific poverty alleviation goals. An example of a successful ADF poverty alleviation project is provided by the "NGO-Microcredit Project" in the Philippines. In the initial phase a loan of $US8 million was made available to the rural poor by using NGOs as intermediaries. The NGOs lend the money for small scale projects that will increase farmers' incomes and enable others to become self employed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the major objectives of the ADB's policy on the role of women in development is to fund projects which enhance women's status in society and improve their quality of life by providing education, employment, training and income generating opportunities. For example, the ADF "Rural Women Employment Creation Project" in Bangladesh involves collaboration with local NGOs to mobilise women in rural areas and facilitate their access to credit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the 1980s, the ADB became increasingly concerned about the impact of development on ecological balance. A framework has now been established for incorporating environmental concerns into the overall objectives and strategies of loans for socio-economic development in the Bank's developing member countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's representatives on the boards of the  multilateral development banks are required to examine environmental issues. The Bank is responding to our concerns and other donors on this issue. For projects that have a significant impact on the environment, the ADB releases environmental impact assessment statements at least four months before the project goes before the executive board for consideration. This enables concerned groups to examine the proposals in detail and raise any concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contributions to the ADF are a significant conduit for achieving the objectives of Australia's development cooperation program. About 60 per cent of ADF funds has been committed to projects in Bangladesh and Pakistan, where the average per capita income in 1989 was $US180 and $US360 respectively. Australia's bilateral aid programs in these countries are relatively small in terms of their total development needs. Thus, channelling funds through the ADF is a significant means of achieving the humanitarian objective of providing assistance to the poorest countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia, along with most other donors, argued for access for China and India to ADF resources during the fifth replenishment of the ADF. Unfortunately, a consensus amongst donors could not be reached on access by China and India. The ADF-6 negotiations concluded, to our regret, on the basis of no access by China and India, but our policy stance is unchanged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indonesia and the Philippines were granted renewed access to ADF resources during the previous replenishment period. These funds were made available on a temporary basis to assist in their major economic restructuring efforts. These countries' economic shocks are not as yet fully overcome, and in each there are significantly large numbers of very poor people. Australia and several other donors successfully argued for continued support for them over the ADF-6 period. ADF activities complement our considerable bilateral programs in Indonesia and the Philippines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In introducing this piece of legislation, the government takes this opportunity to express the hope that the international community will see the importance of working together to overcome the very significant developmental challenges confronting Vietnam and Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia, in the negotiations, argued strongly for a resumption of ADF lending to eligible countries in Indo-China, including Vietnam and Cambodia. Donors have agreed that these countries should have access to ADF funds as soon as conditions become appropriate for the Bank to resume lending to these countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has been successful in getting the ADB to provide more assistance to the small Pacific Island developing member countries as well as to Papua New  Guinea. The ADB is now a major participant in policy dialogue in South Pacific countries in cooperation with the World Bank. Australia has played a major role in encouraging the ADB to strengthen the Bank's resources in its South Pacific regional office in Vanuatu. As a consequence, the ADB will be better placed to undertake detailed country economic assessments for its seven Pacific Island member states.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Papua New Guinea, the ADB is taking a lead agency role in the agricultural, ports, roads and health sectors and the Bank is implementing a number of major projects in these sectors. ADB involvement has broadened the base of assistance available to Papua New Guinea, at a time when there has been a reduction in budgetary support under the Australian bilateral development cooperation program. The ADB is the only major Multilateral development bank providing concessional credit to Papua New Guinea for new loans. Overall, ADB lending to Papua New Guinea is expected to be in the region of $US100 million annually.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ADB provides a significant source of procurement for Australian business. In 1990, the total value of procurement by Australian businesses from ADB projects was at least $US77.6 million; $US21.9 million of this total was from the ADF. I am keen to maximise Australian business opportunities with the Bank. At present an inter-departmental task force is examining the issue and will be reporting to me soon on what action can be taken to improve on this performance. As a result, I hope that we will be able to see a significant increase in procurement from Australia for ADB projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ADB is seeking to improve the quality of its projects. Emphasis is placed on post evaluation work to improve the quality and sustainability of projects. According to the ADB's latest assessment of the success of its ADF projects, on average, fifty-two per cent were assessed to be generally successful and forty-three per cent were assessed to be partially successful. While these figures are somewhat skewed because they are based on sampling mainly poor projects, Bank staff argue that valuable lessons have been learned. The Bank is incorporating these lessons of experience in current operations. We will continue to monitor ADB performance in this area very carefully. In my opinion, it is highly desirable that evaluation of projects should be as open and independent as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's Executive Director on the Board of the ADB has an important role in encouraging the adoption of better management procedures to improve the administration of the bank. Australia, with strong support from other members, was instrumental in getting the ADB to establish an external tribunal to handle staff grievances. In other administrative changes, the ADB has adopted much more transparent processes in staff selection and promotion procedures. It has also improved its program operations through the preparation of a medium term strategic plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another key achievement&mdash;which Australia has supported&mdash;has been to reduce the share of the ADF replenishment that could be allocated to program as opposed to project loans. Program or sector loans are relatively new and there is insufficient evidence at present to assess their long term success rate. Australia argued that there should be a cap specifically for ADF program loans. A 22.5 per cent limit has now been agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Against this background of increasingly satisfactory performance of the ADB in Asian Pacific development, we have to consider our capacity to contribute in future. We are conscious of financial pressures on the development cooperation budget in general, and in particular on the bilateral programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the last replenishment (ADF-5) Australia contributed 7.98 per cent of the total replenishment value. To maintain a 7.98 per cent share of the replenishment would have required a contribution of $431 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the course of the negotiations, several other donors appealed to Australia to maintain its ADF-5 share. We explained to them that the reduction from our last share was necessitated by our difficult economic and budgetary situation, and our wish to maintain flexibility in the aid budget. While a share of 6.5 per cent represents a significant drop in Australia's share from the last replenishment, it is still higher than the 6.1 per cent average of Australia's previous contributions to the ADF, and we remain the second largest regional donor in the fund, after Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unlike other commitments under the development cooperation program, payments to the concessional arms of the Multilateral development banks are made over a period as long as ten years. We now face a situation where, to fulfil past commitments, the share of the development cooperation program allocated to the Multilateral development banks could rise to over 18 per cent in 1994-95. This compares with a share of 8 per cent in the mid 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The move to limit the growth of the share of ADF in the overall development cooperation budget reflects the need to maintain flexibility in the program, given budgetary constraints on the overall development cooperation budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While this Bill is concerned with contributions to the ADF, I have already indicated to the World Bank that our contributions to their concessional lending fund, the International Development Association (IDA), will be similarly constrained. With a similar approach to reducing Australia's share in IDA, the $350 million contribution to ADF-6 could eventually stabilise the multilateral development banks' share of the aid budget at  around 12-14 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to conclude by outlining briefly the payment arrangements for ADF-6. In accordance with previous practice, payment will be made in the form of non-negotiable, non-interest bearing promissory notes. The promissory notes will contribute to the ADF-6 lending authority for the period 1992-1995. It is expected that the promissory notes will be encashed over a period of eight to ten years beginning in 1992/93. These funds will be included in the annual development cooperation budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Estimates of drawdowns for ADF-6 are $1.8 million per year over the period 1992/93 to 1995/96, $9.6 million in 1996/97, and approximately $83 million per year in the following four years. These estimates of drawdowns are subject to change, as they are dependent upon exchange rates and the actual rate of disbursements by the fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, the Asian Development Bank and its Asian Development Fund have an important role to play in continuing to foster economic and social development in the region of immediate interest to Australia. Our contribution to the fifth replenishment will confirm our support for the poorest developing countries in our region by providing highly concessional assistance.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>When the Senate Committee began its inquiry into the John Curtin School in December 1992, individual members held widely divergent views, both on the events which had led to the Senate's reference of the issue to the Committee and on the likely outcomes of the Committee's deliberations. Five months later, after four public hearings and receipt of more than 100 written submissions, some of us have modified our earlier assessments of the situation. Although we have not reached unanimity on all of the issues under consideration, it would be fair to say that our views are much closer now than when we began the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the course of our inquiry, arrangements at the John Curtin School have changed significantly. Originally the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) had proposed that funding for the school be removed from the Department of Employment, Education and Training and placed with the National Health and Medical Research Council. He saw this as a means of improving accountability for public funding of research conducted at the school, and of enhancing peer review of the work undertaken  there. In reaching this view the Minister relied heavily upon the advice of a committee which reviewed the Institute of Advanced Studies&mdash;of which the John Curtin School is a part&mdash;in 1990. This committee was chaired by Sir Ninian Stephen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANU opposed these arrangements.It considered that the university itself could rectify the problems identified at the John Curtin School without reliance upon external bodies. It also regarded the move as a potential threat to its autonomy and, by implication, to the autonomy of universities in general. In the event, negotiations between the university and the NHMRC broke down and funding of the school is now being channelled through the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services rather than through DEET. This is still a concern for the university, which prefaced its agreement to the new arrangements with the statement that its preferred position was a return to funding through DEET. The Minister's concerns about accountability and peer review have been largely addressed through the establishment of an advisory board at the John Curtin School and through NHMRC involvement in peer review and funding decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this Committee began its inquiry into the John Curtin School it assumed that the issues and arguments had already been well-rehearsed in earlier inquiries. The task, it appeared, was primarily to evaluate the merits of the arguments and conclusions of the Stephen committee, in particular as they related to the John Curtin School. In the event, the Senate Committee has felt bound by the evidence before it to subject to critical analysis the procedures, as well as the findings and recommendations, of that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While attention in recent years has focused on problems at the John Curtin School, the Senate Committee's view of the school is very positive. The school can continue to play a major role in Australian biomedical research. The future will rest largely with the younger scientists, and the Committee feels very strongly that their work should be nurtured and supported in an environment of career opportunity and excellence in research. To this end the Committee has recommended the introduction of five-year rolling appointments for non-tenured members of the school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the only recommendation we make in this report. We are pleased to note, as explained above, that many of the original difficulties at the school which led to the Senate's reference of this matter to this Committee have since been resolved to the satisfaction of all the interested parties, thus rendering further recommendations superfluous. We are hopeful that outstanding issues still in contention will, in time, be resolved in a similarly satisfactory manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has made no recommendation relating to the source of funding for the school since it could reach no agreement on this issue. The view of a minority of Committee members is that, in the absence of any clearly demonstrated benefits from the current arrangements, funding should be returned to the Department of Employment, Education and Training. They, the minority, are concerned that the university's autonomy is diminished by current arrangements because the university can no longer determine the allocation of funding to one of its component schools. The majority view is that the source of funding is of no practical import to the school and that, given the need for stability there, the current agreed funding arrangements should remain in place. In its view the new arrangements do not impinge upon the university's capacity to discharge its responsibilities under its Act so that its autonomy is not at risk. I commend the report to the Senate, to the university, to the John Curtin School of Medical Research and to all of those individuals who may in the future be called upon to sit on committees of inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just indicate that it was the unanimous view of the Committee that we needed to spend a considerable period of time examining, not only the recommendations of the Stephen committee, but in fact the processes which preceded those recommendations. We believe that in our analysis of the processes followed by the Stephen committee we may be able to point out some handy hints, if I can put it that way, to all committees of inquiry, government, Senate, or eminent persons in committees of inquiry, which may at some time be looking at various institutions around this country&mdash;whether they happen to be banks, education institutions, or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that it is very important in the processes of any inquiry that hypotheses that the Committee members may be close to reaching should be tested on those people who are most affected by it&mdash;and possibly on the community at large. Then at least a public debate could occur and people might respond to what they believe to be the possible recommendations of a committee. Those people who feel in some way that they have not had their day in court or their opportunity to put their views would be given an opportunity to respond. We believe that during the process this was one of the problems that the Stephen committee faced. The likely recommendations that they were going to arrive at&mdash;the hypotheses that they were testing in their own minds&mdash;were tested only with two senior members of the university. That that was considered a sufficient basis to provide appropriate feedback before the committee then made its final recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that that was a flaw in the processes followed by the Stephen committee, and it is in some cases a flaw in the processes followed by a number of committees&mdash;some in this place, some in public inquiries. In other words, they do not give people sufficient chance to respond to their likely judgments so that, when the reports are tabled, not only the nature of the recommendations but also some of the judgments made often come as a surprise to some people. It seems to us that, in many cases, if the community at large and those who are affected by an inquiry are given the opportunity to have their say, to know that in fact the inquiry is focusing on them, then they are in a better position to put forward their views and to contradict, say, some assumptions which may be underlying the nature of the inquiry into their particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We felt that during the Stephen inquiry it was pretty obvious that the focus not only moved from the other schools to the John Curtin School of Medical Research but that it moved without, in a sense, many of the people in that school being aware that they were in fact the school that was primarily under the spotlight. If they had known that there was a change of emphasis in the Stephen committee's processes, that in fact they were at the centre of the attention of that committee, many of them, I believe, would have responded in a way which would have been more detailed and would have taken into account some of the assumptions underlying the Stephen committee's views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say that the recommendations of the Stephen committee were wrong. We are saying that the process itself created two problems. Firstly, certain factual matters were overlooked and certain assumptions were not tested in the broader university context or, for that matter, in the broader context of the community's views. Secondly, the people within the school felt that the emphasis had swung to them, but they were not quite aware that they were the subject of intense scrutiny on the part of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that in mind, those people who read the report, I think, will find some interest in what the Senate Committee has to say not only about the John Curtin School of Medical Research and the ANU, but also about the way that all committees of inquiry should operate so that everyone gets a fair opportunity to respond to accusations that are made against them. We believe that in the long run, for the health of any institution, if accusations and assumptions are going to made about the necessary improvement or some of the faults that may be prevalent in a particular institution, they should be made at least publicly or semi-publicly so that they can be tested on those people who are most affected by the ultimate recommendations of that inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We leave the Senate with that timely reminder, I believe, about the way in which all our committees should work, where possible. We understand that in some situations, obviously, the highest confidentiality might have to pertain to the committee's likely recommendations. I believe that that is important only in areas which might relate, for example, to foreign exchange values or other areas where it may be possible for someone who wishes to make money out of the committee's likely recommendations. In most other cases, I believe, a public exposure of the criticisms and the likely recommendations of a committee, either through a working paper or a discussion paper before the final recommendations are made, could help people to believe that they have had their day in court and that they have been given a fair hearing, and ultimately the final recommendations are likely to be more sophisticated and realistic as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that, I thank my fellow Committee members for the work they did on this Committee, and the secretariat of the Committee. I thank the various people affected by the inquiry&mdash;the 100 or so people who put in submissions and the hundreds of people who attended the four public hearings assiduously&mdash;for their cooperation. I do not think we have had, outside of a game between Collingwood and Carlton, such a crowd in this place to hear the workings of a committee. We believe that what we have recommended here not only traverses the history of what occurred and, therefore, tries to place much of it in context, but also gives people an opportunity to feel satisfied that their viewpoints have all had some expression in public and have had a reasonable hearing before the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training presents its report into the John Curtin School of Medical Research. The Committee was asked to look at the proposal to divest the Australian National University of administrative and financial control of the John Curtin School by transferring the funding responsibilities to the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. The Committee was asked to pay particular attention to the most desirable mechanism of control and administration of the school, relevant communications between the school and the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), and the implications of the proposed funding arrangements for the autonomy of Australian universities in general.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee was split on its findings. I would really like to pay tribute to other members of the Committee for the extremely thorough and professional way in which they went about their deliberations. We did have considerable agreement on a number of things, particularly on the area of process, but in our findings there were a number of areas that we did take a different view on; and I will come back to those as I go through this report today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my belief and the belief of my colleagues that the autonomy of all our higher education institutions is threatened by the precedent that will be established by this attack on the John Curtin School of Medical Research. The school was originally set up under the Australian National University Act as an integral part of the Institute of Advanced Studies within the university. It is clearly the intention of the ANU Act that the funding of the university be allocated by the Parliament to the ANU and that the ANU Council then allocate funding in the way it feels appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has actually taken part of the funding of the Australian National University, that is, funding for the John Curtin School of Medical Research, and placed it in the hands of another department&mdash;Health, Housing and Community Services. In this way the Government has the facility to directly influence what goes on in that school. It is, I believe, an outrageous action by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services. It is, in effect, circumventing the will of this Parliament and the ANU Act. It is amputating a dynamic and integral part of the university. It is an invasion of the autonomy of the university. It is being done against the will of those involved in the John Curtin School, as indicated by their staff meetings on this issue. It is being done against the will of the Australian National University, as indicated by the resolutions on this issue by the ANU Council. It is being done against the will of two of the founding fathers of the university, Sir Mark Oliphant and Dr H.C. Coombes, both having expressed vehement opposition to the actions of the Minister. It is clear, therefore, that the Minister must not be allowed to continue with this action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has been looking at the basis upon which the Minister made his decision to intervene so radically in the affairs of an autonomous university. The Minister has been called on countless times not to proceed with this action until the Committee has reported its findings, but the Minister refused and pursued an inappropriate course of action. The findings of this report must surely make the Minister look again at the facts surrounding the John Curtin School inquiry and reverse his decision on the funding of that school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The action of the Minister was precipitated by the findings of the Stephen committee. This committee was established to look at the operation of the Institute of Advanced Studies within the ANU. The result was for that committee to single out the John Curtin School for scathing criticism and recommend this radical move by the Minister. From the report presented to the Senate today let me present this quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Committee is unanimous in its concerns over shortcomings in the processes followed by the Stephen Committee during its review of the Institute insofar as this related to the John Curtin School. The Senate Committee considers that such shortcomings diminish the value of the decisions arrived at.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that the findings of the Stephen committee can be seriously questioned. The process of collecting evidence, communicating with the school and consultation with the Australian National University was completely unsatisfactory. The Senate Committee reports that it has found that there developed different interpretations about the terms of reference of the Stephen committee. It is clear that the Stephen committee was established to review the Institute as a whole, not the individual schools in detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee interpreted the terms of reference in relation to the JCSMR as licence to investigate the extent of the implementation of the recommendations of previous reviews of the school, particularly the review in 1988 led by Professor Korner. As it developed, the Stephen committee did start to look more closely at the John Curtin School and whether the recommendations of the 1988 review were being implemented. It is particularly unfortunate that, at this point, it was not made clear to the school of the development in the focus of the Stephen committee. Many argue that, had they been aware of the specific attention being placed on the JCSMR, they would have ensured that the Stephen committee received a comprehensive range of views. As it is, it appears that the Stephen committee received a reasonably narrow range of opinions on the school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Committee found that the Stephen committee determined that there were problems particular to the JCSMR that required particular attention. Having discovered this, I believe, they should have advised the school that such a specific interest had emerged. The Committee is also concerned that the members of the Stephen committee who visited the school gave no indication to the people they interviewed that the school and its progress and the 1988 review reforms were of particular concern to them. The Stephen committee acknowledged that it relied heavily on the findings of the 1988 review. The Senate Committee finds it curious, therefore, that it failed to hold discussions with members of that review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Stephen committee also failed to check with the divisional heads of the school the extent to which the 1988 recommendations were being implemented. From this, the Stephen committee made recommendations in direct conflict with those of the 1988 review. On evidence presented to the Senate Committee it was concluded that the Stephen committee had overstated the case that the John Curtin School was alone within the Institute in attracting a significant number of critical submissions. It would therefore appear that the critical submissions exerted a disproportionate influence both on the Stephen committee and, presumably through that committee, on the advice given to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Oral submissions to the Stephen committee and the consultative process can also be criticised. The Senate Committee has found that, during consultation, the Stephen committee gave those people interviewed no indication of its line of thinking. As a consequence, people were denied the opportunity to rebut unfounded criticism or not prevent a different perspective from emerging, which might have resulted in a more balanced assessment of the situation at the school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Committee disapproves of methods which restrict opportunity for a fair exchange of views and argument, particularly between people legitimately and responsibly involved in the significant features of the debate. It is interesting that in contrast to the procedures of the Stephen committee, the Senate Committee allowed a very wide range of expression of opinion and did weigh up evidence very carefully. The Stephen committee found that the John Curtin Medical School had special problems not shared by other schools. The Senate Committee findings, based on the reviews of the research schools made available to the Stephen committee, are that this was not necessarily the case. If we actually did a study of criticisms of other schools and the sorts of things that were being criticised, it did not particularly stand out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Stephen committee also found that the implementation of recommendations of the 1978 and 1988 reviews had been slow, if they had been carried out at all. There is conflicting evidence on this, but the Senate Committee concludes that all but one of the 1988 review recommendations were being implemented within the time frame specified, and morale at the school had improved significantly. The Senate Committee concludes that the Stephen committee findings on morale and on the reforms implemented at the JCSMR were less than accurate and attributes this to the Stephen committee's failure to seek adequate advice on the progress of the implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Committee is not convinced that the Stephen committee's report demonstrates that the problems it identified would be resolved by the solutions it proposed. It has not been made clear, for example, how the transfer of funding would improve morale and leadership, assist in the recruitment and retention of staff, or reduce criticism. Bound by the evidence before it, the Senate Committee believes that the shortcomings of the Stephen committee review process detract from the validity of its conclusions and bring into question actions predicated upon its findings. It is clear from the evidence presented before the Senate Committee that the proposed funding changes had disadvantages for both the John Curtin School and the ANU. The Minister has failed to demonstrate any overriding benefit from this transfer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also clear that the autonomy of Australian universities, in general, is threatened by these new arrangements. The JCSMR is unlike any other medical research institute that has funding through the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. It is an integral part of the university and not merely affiliated to one. The removal of funding from DEET sets a precedent for this situation where any faculty could be removed from DEET and placed in the hands of another department whose operations are viewed as congruent with the subject matter of the faculty concerned. Clearly, this is an undesirable situation and it cannot be tolerated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most desirable mechanism to control the administration of the John Curtin School is through the ANU, as it was originally established. This means that funding must come through DEET. Given the findings of the Senate Committee, the Minister must reverse his decision and return the funding arrangements to DEET. The decision of the Minister has been based on poor information and it cannot be demonstrated that the Minister's actions will actually correct the problems identified. It is clear that the problems identified by the 1988 review have already been addressed during the Stephen committee review, with one exception and that exception is now being corrected. I commend the report to the Senate and urge the Minister to act now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Australian Democrats I rise to speak to this long awaited report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Training inquiry into the John Curtin School of Medical Research. The Committee found itself examining the school following a reference passed by this place last year, moved by the Opposition, which the Democrats supported. At the time, the issue of the transfer of funding for the JCSMR from the Department of Employment, Education and Training to the National Health and Medical Research Council caused an enormous controversy at the ANU for a whole variety of reasons. It was a view of the Democrats that these issues were sufficiently serious as to warrant further scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I supported this reference because, clearly, the funding transfer had caused enormous public and private controversy, and as a result had distracted many scientists at the school and at the ANU from the important business of medical research. The actions of the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) appeared to lack justification, and appeared to represent a direct threat to the autonomy of the ANU, and the ability of the university to administrate and fulfil its duties under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After lengthy public hearings, to which I brought a fairly open mind, I have arrived at the conclusion on the matter, which is largely reflected in the minority report. The funding transfer of JCSMR to the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services is of no demonstrable benefit to the school and is a threat, in the words of the report, `to the autonomy of the ANU', and `an unwarranted and unnecessary interference in the activities and administration of the University'. To that extent, it does represent a threat to the university's autonomy. However, it was my view&mdash;this is where I differ from those other honourable senators who supported the minority report&mdash;that the funding transfer does not have serious implications for the autonomy of Australian universities as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The John Curtin School of Medical Research is one of four research schools within the Institute of Advanced Studies. It is a unique institution which was founded many years ago in a vastly different university research climate. The institute has no teaching functions and, therefore, cannot be considered a faculty in the accepted sense of the word. It is a ridiculous proposition to suggest, as Senators Crane, Calvert and Tierney have done, that as a result of this move every faculty, at every university, is potentially under the same threat of having its funding arbitrarily removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that university faculties are already under threat from under-resourcing and the squeeze on funds. Arts faculties, in particular, are under enormous stress as they face budget cuts, staff retrenchments, cutbacks in tutorials and so forth. However, the funding transfer is, in my view, a repudiation of the unique position held by the Institute of Advanced Studies. It appears to represent a desire on the part of the Minister to tidy up medical research funding without recognition of the special place the John Curtin School holds within the academic community at the ANU. Given that many witnesses, and even the Stephen committee report itself, considered plurality of funding to be a desirable mechanism in research activities. Further centralisation of funds for medical research within the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services has no demonstrated benefits in this particular case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we continued to hear evidence it became clear that the Minister had placed enormous weight on the opinions of the Stephen committee, which recommended the funding transfer for JCSMR. Indeed, early on, the Stephen committee considered breaking up the school and transferring its activities to other centres. However, the Senate Committee report clearly demonstrates that the Stephen committee based its view of the school on preconceived notions about the problems the school faced. The views of one or two committee members&mdash;in particular, those of Professor Niall&mdash;were extremely influential in the Stephen committee's recommendations but, in our view, the information collected in respect of the school was highly deficient and could not support the Stephen committee's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only two visits were made to the school itself, one by Professor Niall in February 1990 and another by Professor Kramer in July 1990. These were informal visits and no formal evidence was collected, yet considerable attention was placed in the Stephen committee report on John Curtin School. The Committee can find no justification for this on the basis of either the Stephen committee's terms of reference or the evidence collected by the Stephen committee in respect of the school. The nature of the consultations and processes used by the Stephen committee left a great deal to be desired, especially in relation to the recommendations made in respect of the John Curtin School of Medical Research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my Committee colleagues have already said, it is vitally important that inquiry processes be open, transparent, known to all and widely advertised. For any committee deliberations and recommendations to have credible force, due processes must be adopted. As a result of the processes adopted by the Stephen committee, in the words of the report, `to the extent that the advice given to the Minister was flawed, any action flowing from that advice risked being impaired'. Mindful of this, the Senate Committee has endeavoured, to the best of its ability, to conduct its inquiries in a fair and open manner. We have sought a wide variety of views and have endeavoured in good faith to present the issues relating to John Curtin School fairly and without undue influence of partisan views. I believe we have achieved our goal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the hope of the Democrats that, now that a range of issues has been canvassed and had a fair hearing, the able scientists at John Curtin School of Medical Research can continue unimpaired their important work. Most of the reforms outlined in the 1988 Korner review are now in place and should result in a more robust organisation whose work is subject to independent scrutiny. The Democrats believe, however, that as a result of this inquiry the Minister should see fit to return funding of the John Curtin School of Medical Research to the Department of Employment, Education and Training and back into the hands of the ANU where it rightly belongs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity now, because I will not have it later, to make a few observations about the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training into the proposal to divest the Australian National University of administrative and financial control of the John Curtin School of Medical Research. I endorse everything that Senator Sowada said, except for one matter that we disagree on, which is about the staff and the amount of work they did. This morning I managed to grab a sample of the evidence we received and the work that has been put in by the staff. What I have here is about a quarter of the material we had.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that the inquiry that we carried out into the John Curtin School of Medical Research was much more thorough and much better researched than the previous one, done by the Stephen committee. I was concerned, as we all were, about the findings of the Stephen committee and the way in which the committee was used to try to divert funding away from the Australian National University. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was touched on by the Chairman of the Senate Committee, I think it also highlighted the problem that arises when Ministers call for eminent people to conduct inquiries. I have no argument with the appointment of Sir Ninian Stephen or Dame Leonie Kramer&mdash;I think they are very eminent and very honourable people&mdash;but in this case I think there is very good evidence to suggest in the report that the Stephen committee was heavily influenced by one particular person, who is himself recognised as a very well-known scientist. I tend to think that he may have been somewhat biased in his views. I remember one classic statement that was reported where he referred to the John Curtin School as a sheltered workshop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that every member of the Committee certainly spent more time in the John Curtin Medical School than some members, if not all members, of the Stephen committee. I certainly saw no evidence that this particular medical school was a sheltered workshop; in fact, to my way of thinking, it was quite to the contrary. It seemed to be a vibrant research centre comprising young talent, conducting research of a very significant nature that will be, in the future, I believe, of tremendous value not only to Australia, but to the whole world. For the evidence that was given to us during our inquiry to indicate that a lot of the work being done there was irrelevant was&mdash;to me, anyway&mdash;quite erroneous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Being a lay person and never having been involved very much with research scientists, the thing that came through to me was the very competitive nature of some academics. They certainly defend very strongly their ability to do research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope, now that this Committee report has been tabled and all of the facts have been put down, that the morale of the school will lift and that those rumblings that have been going on underneath the surface&mdash;quite bitter rumblings, as we saw in some of the evidence that was given to us&mdash;are put aside and the researchers get back to doing what they do best, that is, finding cures for the common cold, or transplanting thyroid glands from mice into the foetuses of sheep. As a former member of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare, I was particularly pleased to see the efforts to which the researchers had gone to protect the welfare of the animals on which they were experimenting for the good of human beings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tierney has raised most of the concerns that Opposition members had. I am pleased to say, as the Chairman indicated earlier, that there was general agreement on most of the important issues. The only recommendation made, of course, was that in future there be rolling appointments for non-tenured members of the school. Far from being a sheltered workshop, the quality and youth of the researchers certainly did impress me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to say much more, Mr Acting Deputy President, other than once again to thank my colleagues for the amount of work they put in&mdash;some more than others.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few general comments on the matter of the autonomy of universities. It seems to me that what is occurring here is a symptom of the onslaught which this Government has made against the universities over some considerable time, in a variety of ways. As Senator Sowada mentioned, it is occurring in relation to funding, the amalgamations and, in this particular case, the removal from the university of the John Curtin School of Medical Research.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be self-evident, I would think, that the universities contain some of the very best brains, the best minds, in this country. They contain those minds, those brains, those concerns, in institutions of learning where, in a number of formal and informal ways, the whole panoply of social processes are discussed on a daily basis. Consequently, the universities, more than any other institution, are those institutions best qualified to hold up a mirror to society, to say to society, `Look, we believe that perhaps you are going in the wrong direction with respect to this or that. There are alternative courses of action open to you, there are alternative options which can be pursued. There are alternative paths, there are alternative futures'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the Government, with its rather narrow and restricted and politically oriented views of the future, it is a vision&mdash;in fact, I would say in this case lack of vision&mdash;to be intruding into those institutions and to be attempting to impose on them through these various processes a narrowing. I think this marks a very dangerous trend, of which of course this was simply one symptom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give just one example from my own former field of research, in the medical area a lot of research will be done from time to time in the area of occupational and environmental health. This will bring researchers in these areas into direct conflict with many of the most powerful influences in our society. For those institutions to be in any sense more directly under the control of government or any other body&mdash;and also I would reflect here on the need for CSIRO to get 30 per cent of its funding from private sources, and the same sorts of pressures are being brought on universities to get funding outside from private bodies&mdash;and for them to be put under those sorts of pressures seriously impacts on their ability to speak out fearlessly and openly in defence of the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons I think it is very important that the Senate be aware of the pressures being brought by government upon the tertiary institutions, particularly the universities. We must resist those things and seek to ensure that the universities maintain that academic freedom which has been their right, their privilege and their social responsibility. I would stress that in relation to the universities themselves, because they have not always discharged their social responsibilities, it is very important that those matters be defended, and accordingly it seems to me that this Committee report is very important. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly and then to adjourn the debate. The reason for this is that the report is not yet generally available. There are a number of senators with a strong interest in this subject, including the Deputy President, who is a member of the ANU Council, who have not seen the report and who no doubt will wish to comment on it when they have. I personally would like to reply in some detail to Senator Tierney's remarks when I have had the opportunity to have a good look at the material. I have established that there is nobody else in the chamber who wishes to speak at this time so I do not feel bad about adjourning the debate. Therefore, I shall make a few remarks and develop my argument on another occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Calvert congratulated Senator Tierney on referring this matter to the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. I strongly disagree with that point of view. I think this whole matter could have been handled in a much better way had it not had the spotlight of a Senate inquiry. To my mind, it is largely an internal matter within the ANU and between the ANU and the relevant government funder. If it were happening at any other university in Australia, the position may be different. I know of no case, for example, in Victoria in regard to Melbourne University, where internal university matters have been the subject of lengthy debate by a committee of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I disagree with the view that has been put to us on a number of occasions by witnesses and by members of the Committee that there is something very special about the ANU. There was when it was set up originally, but I do not think those arguments apply any longer. Nor do I agree&mdash;to mention one of the points where I would disagree with the minority on the Committee&mdash;that, to use Senator Tierney's words, there is any invasion of the autonomy of the university. I will develop that on another occasion because I strongly disagree with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Calvert referred to this matter and the reason for referral to the Committee as a grave injustice averted. I do not see it as an injustice to have similar funding arrangements for the John Curtin School as applies in other equally eminent research institutes around Australia such as, to name two in my own State, the Hall Institute and the Baker Institute. In fact, Sir Gustav Nossal, one of the most eminent medical scientists in Australia, made this very point in a letter to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also disagree that bringing these things out into the open and letting&mdash;to quote our report&mdash;`everyone have their day in court' is necessarily a good thing. To my mind, if you are trying to negotiate a new situation, sometimes a lot of publicity in a sensational way, at least in the local press, often negates both the healing process and the process of getting on with the negotiations and coming to a conclusion, rather than helping them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Several weeks ago, the Senate comprehensively addressed the Forest Conserevation and Development Bill 1991 in the second reading debate. I am sure that anybody who has followed the media in the past few weeks would be well aware that this is an issue that certainly excites the community. My only regret is that it is a pity that some of the Tasmanian media, particularly the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS>, take such a biased, restricted and, frankly, awful, view of reporting of this particular issue, particularly when it is so important in Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me come back to the issues that now have to be addressed. In closing the second reading debate, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) made and put down an important government position. It would appear that, in the three intervening weeks, this Labor Government has got itself into an even worse mess on this issue than it has got into on the economy. The Labor Party politics on this issue are shameful and disgraceful. The discussions between the Opposition and the Government, between the industry and the Government, among all of the interested parties on this matter, have been blown out of the water by crass politics within the Labor Party in the last few days. It is now seeking to jeopardise jobs for thousands of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has argued consistently for months that the Government has been trying to introduce impossibly compromised umbrella legislation to cover specific major projects and the myriad smaller timber projects in the regional forests. At the same time, because of the struggle in Cabinet between the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), this Bill fails adequately to provide the resource security necessary for the smaller projects under $100m. That is why we, in conjunction with the industry&mdash;particularly the peak body, NAFI, and the timber unions&mdash;have prepared amendments to do just that. In the course of this committee stage, I will be proceeding with those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also wanted to enhance investment prospects by removing the no compensation clause. We&mdash;that is, the Liberal and National parties and also, Mr Temporary Chairman, the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, of which you are a member&mdash;received a great welter of evidence that totally supported the view and the need for change to amend them. We highlighted the weaknesses in the legislation, such as the unnecessary and the expensive duplication of State and Federal procedures, as well as the lack of genuine resource security because of the ability of the Federal Minister to alter an earlier decision to provide resource from a given area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We argue that it is better to have separate project specific legislation for major projects such as pulp mills and to use the State and industry regional forest agreements as the basis for development of the timber industry. It must be remembered that there cannot be a paper mill without the timber industry also involved to utilise the heavier logs and to maximise the value adding of the total resource. This approach has been increasingly confirmed by the report of the Resource Assessment Commission, which, of course, we discussed in this chamber in the last couple of days and which ironically was tabled in the Senate only after the legislation had been wheeled and dealed with by the Government. It had been held back very specifically from the Senate Standing Committee; by the evidence before the Senate Standing Committee inquiry itself; by the recent Western Australian southern forest agreement; and even by the One Nation statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments moved by the coalition in the House of Representatives were designed to provide reasonable resource security for investment to take place in Australia's 1,200 small mills to improve utilisation and value adding as well as to embrace investment prospects for major projects. The Government had indicated its inability to accept these amendments, but it was prepared to recognise that the Bill really covers only major projects of more than $100m&mdash;that is, pulp and paper mills; to establish a monitoring process to check whether industry and coalition doubts about its effectiveness, even for major projects, are correct and therefore changes need to be made; and to enter into genuine negotiations with NAFI on providing resource security for the rest of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like at this stage to refer to the basic agreement between the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) and the National Association of Forest Industries, the Tasmanian Government, the Forest Industry Association of Tasmania, and the Forest Protection Society. I had hoped, and anticipated by the moves that were being taken in the past week or so, that this agreement would have resulted today in compromises and in legislation that the Government itself would have been prepared to initiate in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What would have been achieved, what would have been done, under that agreement? We anticipated that the Government  would have agreed to re-title the Bill to the Forest Conservation and Major Projects Bill and that all provisions of the Bill would then remain unchanged. This would have accommodated all of the issues and would not have enabled so many things to take place. The understanding would have been that the Government would then undertake to monitor and review the effectiveness of the legislation to ensure that it achieves its objectives of certainty and security for the industry and generates value adding investment and jobs in the forest industries. If it can be demonstrated that the legislation has not achieved its objectives within a reasonable timeframe, the Government would, in consultation with the industry, consider what further action might be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point from the intended agreement is that the Government would agree to consult with industry concerning the development of the concept of enhanced intergovernmental agreements designed to provide resource security on a regional basis for those forest industry investments which would not otherwise qualify under the forest conservation and major projects legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further point is that the Federal Government would agree to ongoing discussions with industry and trade unions&mdash;very importantly&mdash;regarding the provision of certainty and security for investment related wood supplies in the context of reviewing ESD, National Plantations Advisory Committee and RAC recommendations prior to developing the national forest strategy. The final point of the intended agreement was that the Federal Government would announce these commitments in the resumption of the debate here in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened? This was rejected and thrown out of court only in the last few days, obviously after some incredible wheeling and dealing in the back rooms of the Government. One only has to look at today's media to see that, very obviously, the Left of the Labor Party&mdash;whether it was Senator Bolkus or Mr Balderstone in the Prime Minister's office or whoever&mdash;the Labor Party's factional-ridden emphasis, has taken over again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry and the coalition had agreed to accept the way in which we would have wanted to go because none of us wants to prevent the development of a pulp mill in northern Tasmania, in Gippsland, or anywhere else in Australia. But the Government's bona fides must now be called into question and into account. I refer senators to clause 10(1) of the Bill, where it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Minister is satisfied that the conditions imposed by sections 11 to 15 (inclusive) have been met in relation to a particular wood processing project, the Minister must, by instrument in writing, declare that this Act applies to the project.</PARA>
<PARA>Put that with the proposed amendment to the title of the Bill, and the other commitments that the Federal Government was to have put on the table, and we could have achieved the objectives that we were all after. But, no, the Government has now rejected and thrown this out, as I said, because of crass Labor politics. Let me quote from today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> under the by-line of Lenore Taylor, where under a heading, `Resource security deal killed by Kelly', it states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After three days of intense negotiation, Mr Griffiths had stitched up a deal between the Opposition, formerly bitter opponents of the legislation, the forestry industry and the Tasmanian Government, which involved only minor amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> He was then told by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, that he would also have to secure the agreement of Mrs Kelly and the Left faction of the ALP before the deal could go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Mrs Kelly on the Left took the opportunity to dump the legislation they had bitterly opposed when it was forced through Cabinet by the then prime minister Mr Bob Hawke last year.</PARA>
<PARA>That article goes on, and obviously Lenore Taylor has some excellent contacts who have told her about the inside innuendo and dealing of the Labor Party and what is going on with this particular issue, and where it is going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our doubts still remain about the detail of the Bill. We say to the industry, large and small, that it has been the victim of the Government's crass, short term, political manoeuvring. The industry has been ready to invest billions of dollars in an environmentally responsible way, in value adding, in timber and paper, and by so doing to create jobs in regional Australia and reduce the $2 billion trade deficit in wood and paper products. If this Government is unable to deliver the commitment it has made to the industry, the employees of the industry, and the coalition, to provide genuine resource and investment security, we will certainly alter it after the next election. We will certainly go down that track that the Government was supposedly committed to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Temporary Chairman, I draw to your attention an amendment that I will be moving to clause 1, which I believe is shortly to be distributed in the chamber, which will challenge the Government on this very issue of the agreement that Minister Griffiths struck with the industry, that it indicated to the Opposition it was prepared to work with. We will move that amendment to change the title of the Bill, making it the Forest Conservation and Major Projects Bill, and we will test the Government by saying to the Government, `Why won't you now give the other commitments that you indicated in the consultations and the discussions that you were prepared to move? Why won't you give the commitments that guarantee jobs? Why won't you give the commitments?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only because of the internal faction-ridden Labor Party politics that the Left, the green Left of the Labor Party, has obviously done deals with the Democrats. They are obviously worried about that new magazine flavour because `socialism' is no longer the easy word for the Labor Party to sell; it is pandering to the green Left and the Left of the Labor Party. It is now very easy to see where they have got the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), where they have got the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), and where they have got any of the Ministers that have got anything to do with resource development or security. Yes, we will move the amendment that the Government ought to have put on the table here, as it indicated it would, and we will certainly say that in clause 1 this is an issue that should be addressed. </PARA>

Every single one of them said that this legislation will not pass unless those 17 amendments put up, originally by NAFI, are accepted. What do we find? We find Mr Lloyd and Mr Griffiths trying to do a grubby little deal which would have changed two words only in the title and that, as Senator Tambling has just said, would have made it acceptable to the Opposition.

Senator Tambling comes in here and tries to claim the moral high ground over this by saying that this would have made it all acceptable to them, despite everything that has been said in the past.

Why does it not put its actions where its policy mouth so frequently is when it talks as it does, from a self-righteous plane, saying that it is in favour of development and jobs?  Self-righteous indignation synthetically developed in the pretence to principle&mdash;that is the Opposition's position, and here it stands exposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I talk about principle: I ask the Opposition to declare exactly what the principles are. What it has said in this debate is that the name of the Bill will determine whether it supports it. As I recall, it was Shakespeare who said:</PARA>

Why not declare support for this legislation so that jobs can be created in northern Tasmania? Why not do something which will actually enable a major project to go ahead?

It goes to water, backs off, and the Left takes over, and it goes down the chute. The Government does not want the legislation and it never did. The legislation could not work in the form in which it was presented to the chamber, and we all know that.

For instance, I realise that at present Mr Ferguson may be a bit upset about what his actions brought him into in Tasmania in the last week or two, but surely that should not be enough to determine what happens here concerning national legislation.

Unemployment in that particular area in Tasmania is extremely high and we went out and said, `It is to be the best pulp mill in the world'. We had been given that promise and this Government refused to allow the development in return for the handful of greenie preferences that won it the election. As a coalition, we received at that election the highest number of votes in Australia, but because the Government was given the handful of preferences from the greenies in exchange for refusing to allow development in our island, it was able to win in some of the marginal electorates. That is how it got into government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So government members have always used environmental issues as a political football. When they got into government, they denied us that development in our State. We have to remember that it was not just that development, because when a government has a big industry with a very large investment hanging around waiting expectantly for permission to go ahead, and for political reasons alone it is denied it, then credibility for investment, and the confidence of those people wanting to invest, are completely scuppered. That is what happened in Tasmania. The Government scuppered the confidence of anyone who wanted to come in and invest in development. That was as a result of this Government and Senator Richardson stopping the mill and allowing just a handful of votes to get them into power. It has allowed our State's unemployment to rise to the extent it has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know the way those opposite play politics; we know that they have absolutely insisted on having a recession. We were told so by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when he was Treasurer&mdash;the `recession we had to have' that has become the depression we had to have. We know that we have over a million unemployed. We have just on a million that do not do an hour's work a week. If they have done an hour, according to the statistics, they are employed. So imagine how many people are really underemployed. Those opposite are a disgrace, and they are here again now denying us further employment in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They created the problem; they did all that destructive work; and they got into government. Now they are saying, `Look, we really are good boys. We know that the inter-governmental agreements that we made prior to the election cannot be trusted'&mdash;and everyone who gave evidence to our Committee said that the inter-governmental agreements could not be trusted and that we needed legislation&mdash;`so we will give you legislation'. Who spoke against that legislation in the Cabinet room when Bob Hawke, who was Prime Minister at that stage, was putting it through?  I will tell honourable senators who spoke against it. It was Mr Keating. He opposed that legislation in the Cabinet room&mdash;he opposed it very strongly&mdash;but, when he became Prime Minister, he agreed that the legislation would go through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That legislation is rubbishy legislation, and let me explain why. We need three main amendments, if it is to apply to all resources in Australia. This legislation applies only to investments over $100m. So the timber industry in our State, which wants to invest $32m, has no security of resource at all&mdash;none at all. Anyone who has an investment of $40m, $50m, $60m, or $90m has no security at all; it applies only to investments of $100m. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is in the legislation and, indeed, combined companies wanting to invest down at Geeveston, south of Hobart, have said that they need security of investment. Gunns and Risby want to invest $32m. However, they say, `We are not prepared to go along with that $32m investment unless we have security of resource'. How can they? How can they invest $32m in Geeveston unless they have got some security that they will have a resource to use? They said, `However, this legislation does not cover us and we are not prepared to go ahead with it until it does'. The Minister says, `That is not true'. He cannot be trusted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a committee of the Senate inquire into the legislation. The umbrella group of the industry, NAFI, which covers all forestry industries, came before us and said, `We need the amendments the Opposition is putting. If we do not get them, the legislation is no good'. That is what the forestry industry umbrella group said. We had the unions come before us. The unions said exactly the same thing. The employees, the unions, of those forestry industries said to us, `We want the Opposition amendments. Without them, the legislation is rubbish. It is no good'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then had Tasmanian Forest Products and Petersville Sleigh come before us and say exactly the same thing; `We need the Opposition amendments, without them the legislation is no good'. We had APPM come before us saying, `We want the Opposition amendments'. APPM is the company building the mill. However, the Minister quoted APPM as saying that it will not go along with the mill unless it gets this legislation. APPM has said, `We want the Opposition amendments but because we are very keen to build that mill, even though the legislation is not what we want, we will accept a second-rate piece of legislation and we will attempt to get partners to support us'. When APPM was asked whether it would go ahead with the mill if this legislation went through, it said, `No, we cannot give you that guarantee. We will not say that we will not go ahead without it but we will not give you a guarantee that we will build the mill if we get it because our partners, the people we are going to try to get, may not think this legislation is good enough to join us'. So APPM will not give us a guarantee that it will go ahead with the mill if this legislation goes through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who did we have then? We had Premiers and representatives of Premiers, and we had letters from Premiers to the Committee saying that they all wanted the legislation. This Minister has denied that. Because my time is almost out, I will come back to the main thrust which is that this is a political decision by the Government to destroy the mill on the north-west because of the pressure of the Left. I only want to substantiate that with one quote and that is from the Labor Leader of the Opposition in my State. When he was asked, `Was he happy with the legislation?', he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, I would regard the legislation as not perfect and not a completely accurate reflection of the forest strategy in Tasmania, but I am used to being in positions where I do not get my own way completely.</PARA>
<PARA>When asked if he would be happier if we got the amendments he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I see is that the Left of the Labor Party has grave reservations&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>So the Labor Opposition Leader in our State says that the Labor Party will not take it back because the Left will not agree and a lot of the Right have reservations about it. Do not let the Minister stand here and say that it is not a factional business in the Labor Party; it is nothing else but a factional situation. Senator Bolkus rung the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) in Kuala Lumpur and told her to get onto the Prime Minister to stop it before an agreement had been reached.

So let us not base arguments on the supposition that, if the legislation is passed, or is passed with or without amendments, there is some guarantee that a pulp mill will be built, because that is false.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that is a good place for me to come in. Senator Coulter said that there is no guarantee that the mill will be built even if this legislation is passed. I think that is patently obvious after what has happened in the last couple of days. If the Government cannot even deliver an agreement that was made between the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) and the industry, then how the hell can it believe that a Bill that was passed here today would not be interfered with by Mrs Kelly or by anybody else? She has proved already that she can stop an agreement being honoured by one of her fellow Ministers. So why would the Government, when it suited it&mdash;whether it be a political reason or otherwise&mdash;not find a way around a Bill that has already been passed?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a member of that committee that took evidence. We heard plenty of evidence about agreements that had been broken in the past. In fact, we even had copies of them given to us as evidence. I remember it being put forward by the Minister's representatives at that meeting that these new agreements were going to be enhanced intergovernmental agreements. Quite frankly, if the Government thinks that we would believe that those intergovernmental agreements would be honoured, when we have found out during the last day that it cannot even honour an agreement made between the Minister and the industry, it just shows how worthless and what a waste of time that was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Walters referred to the real reason why there has been an about-face and a breaking of this agreement with the industry yesterday. Mr Field, a former leader of the State Government, made it quite obvious&mdash;and I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I see is that the Left of the Labor Party has grave reservations about the principle of resource security, and there are some in the Right who think that it would be politically expedient if it did not succeed.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what he said. I will not mention the names of members of the Government, but even as recently as last night at a committee meeting I said to a member of the Government that this agreement had fallen apart because of pressure from the left wing, and he said to me, `You are not a thousand per cent wrong on that one'. We know the real reason, and for the Minister to come in here and try to ram down our throat that there is no other reason for that agreement being broken is absolute rubbish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bet that APPM is sitting back and looking at the situation that it is left with. If it could believe this Government, as Senator Coulter said, it would not need any resource security legislation. As Senator Walters said earlier, there is a lot of doubt whether the company would build a mill, anyway. Even if this Bill were passed today, we know for a fact that the company is going to face up to two years of scientific investigation into the resources for that particular mill. So it would have to wait for up to two years anyway, even if the Bill were passed today. What guarantee is there that in that two years Mrs Kelly or somebody from the Green movement or any other movement does not find a five-leaf clover or something similar to hold it up again?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of this matter is that, ever since day one, there has been a hold-up&mdash;all the way through. There have been 11 inquiries in 15 years into timber resources in Tasmania. Another two years of delay is coming about even if the Bill is passed. I do not believe that, if enough pressure is put on Mrs Kelly by the conservation movement, she would not find another excuse to hold it up for even longer. So where would we be?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are we on record as saying that this legislation is no good? We have the support of the industry and of the unions&mdash;or we did have the support of the unions; I think they have changed their mind now after a media release I saw this morning, where the branch secretary of the Tasmanian Workers Union, Mr Ken Bacon, in a letter to the Minister for Resources said that APPM was guilty of atrocities and had ignored its responsibilities to the forest industries. He indicated to the Government that the Bill did not apply to APPM. That is a typical example of what is going on behind the scenes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have to be an absolute idiot to think that there has not been pressure applied to the Government by the union movement over this APPM-union dispute at Burnie. I am not going to buy into the rights and wrongs of what is going on there, but one would have to say that APPM was less than smart in pulling on the unions at such a time. If it was so fair dinkum about having this resource security legislation pass, it certainly chose its time unwisely. Sometimes I wonder what its agenda really is. Nevertheless, it has said that it can live with this Bill. I do not believe it could live with it. In fact, if it were passed, I doubt whether it would, because, as I said previously, if enough pressure were put on Mrs Kelly from the anti-mill people, I am sure that she would find some way around it. She has done in the past, and she would again. We have demonstrated that, and that is the reason we put these amendments forward&mdash;to try to tighten up the Bill to make sure that once approved, it would be workable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the real answer to all this mess was summed up in the National Association of Forest Industries release put out yesterday by Robert Bain. It is headed `Government Credibility Collapses'. He is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry and Opposition made major concessions and we negotiated in good faith with the relevant Minister, who then presented a workable solution to a political impasse to the Prime Minister.</PARA>

<PARA>I remember very well when the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs was receiving evidence. This particular matter has been going on for a long time and I admit it has caused me and, I think, every other Tasmanian senator, a fair amount of heartburn, because we have been concerned about getting the right sort of Bill. But when the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) presented his evidence at that Committee hearing, I began to see a glimmer of hope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, when I returned to my home State and was speaking with particular people who were interested in the Bill, I said, `I have not given this away yet. Comments made by Senator Cook gave me an indication, anyway, that their interpretation of the Bill is a bit different from what we think it is. Perhaps there is room there for negotiation and an agreement down the track'. In fact, I said to somebody down there, `I do not think the opera is over until the fat lady sings'. It looks like the fat lady has sung now and the opera is over, because those glimmers of hope that we saw, the comments that were made, and the agreement that was drummed up yesterday between Minister Griffiths and the industry, have all gone for nothing. The fact is that the coalition parties have moved 95 per cent and the Government will not even move one per cent. That is because they are not allowed to, because the unions are not letting them, and the Prime Minister does not want it, anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was quite amused to hear the Minister for Resources this morning in an interview with Andrew Sholl. Andrew Sholl said, `Okay, at the last minute you had a solution and now it is lost'. Mr Griffiths went on to talk about a discussion paper and the discussions they had. He said, `I have to bring the Bill on today because I do not want to delay it'. He said, `In the end no-one was of a view that a delay was justified'. He made out that it was not worth putting off for another week because Caucus was not meeting for another week. Therefore it would delay matters if he did not bring it in today. After all the hold-ups we have had, to turn around and say that the reason why it came in today was that it would be delayed if it had to go to Caucus was quite amusing because we know that if it went back to Caucus it would be defeated. </PARA>

There are 2,000 jobs in northern Tasmania in the construction phase alone, and this pulp mill would provide the impetus for economic revival in northern Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My reason for rising at this point is to reply to some of the wilder allegations made by the Opposition thus far in the debate and to return to an entreaty I made when I last sat down. None of the Opposition have accepted my invitation to answer the question, so I take this opportunity to remind them of the question. The Federal Government wants this Bill and has put it forward. The Tasmanian Government wants this Bill, has said so and supports it. The proponents of the pulp mill in northern Tasmania want this Bill and have said so, and have asked for it to be supported. The question is: Why will those opposite not vote for it? I would be grateful to hear an answer to that question, because the silence is deafening, and silence is condemnatory in this context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walters has said a couple of things that also require an answer. She made a long contribution here a moment ago about the so-called defects in this Bill on the basis that only projects of $100m or more can get up under this legislation. She cited a number of projects valued at less than $100m in various places in Tasmania that, in her assertion, were unable to get up under this legislation. It is true that this Bill prescribes projects of $100m or more as being encompassed by it. They are substantial projects. Projects at that level are substantial. But it is not true to say that other projects cannot be embraced by the terms of this Bill. In fact, everyone knows that they can. But the obligation on the proponents of projects of lesser value than $100m is to aggregate their projects with other projects drawing on the resource. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot have the view that, no matter what else, the resource is infinite. The resource is the forests of Tasmania; they are not an infinite resource. They are finite. In order that development and industry can proceed, there is an absolute need to know what all of the projects will be that want to draw on that resource and to encourage those projects of lesser value to aggregate, because what the Government does under this legislation is to conduct up-front an analysis of the environmental and ecological properties of the resource that is to be drawn on for development purposes. Once that is completed, and if it meets a reasonable standard, the legislation will enable development to proceed&mdash;not to be re-examined&mdash;so that the development has, as the title says, resource security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is lacking from the Opposition side in this debate is a consideration of the environmental issues. We make no bones about our position as a government. We are in favour of development, but we are in favour of development that is balanced against the environmental concerns. Untrammelled development without regard for the environment is not on. Total and absolute reservation of forests with no development is not on. The question is about having a proper balance between both. So projects below the $100m level, which is the benchmark in this Bill, need to be considered with other projects for the all-round maximum utilisation of the resource, the greatest level of value adding and the greatest return to Australia, either as export or import replacement. It is not right to say that projects worth less than $100m cannot get up. They can, but they do have this obligation to aggregate their project with other projects that are wanting to utilise the same resource so that an overall consideration can be given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that I wish to reply to is a point made by Senator Calvert and other honourable senators opposite, as they have tried to blackguard the name of the Minister for Resources, Mr Griffiths. I must say that Senator Calvert praised Mr Griffiths in order to condemn him. In summary, what has been said by the Opposition is that Mr Griffiths reached an agreement and that was then ratted on. That, in summary, is what has been said. In fact, that may even be an accurate quote from some of the remarks made by honourable senators opposite. I am here to tell them that that is just not true. Mr Griffiths did not make an agreement and nothing has been ratted on. What Mr Griffiths did say, in dealing with this issue, was that, when the Opposition put particular views to him, those views would be relayed to the Government and the Government would respond. That is what Mr Griffiths did. That is an honourable course for a Minister to take. It is a proper and prudent course for a Minister to take. It is what Mr Griffiths did, and the Government has responded. The Government's position is, as is clearly the case, that we want this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Integrated Activities under the</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the period 30 March to 1 April 1992 the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs inquired into the amendments moved by the Opposition to the Government's Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991. During the course of public hearings evidence given to the Committee indicated that there is not a full appreciation of the types of projects that would be eligible for resource security under the Bill. In particular, there is considerable misunderstanding of its application to `integrated activities'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With this in mind the Government believes it would be helpful to articulate further what is envisaged by the term `a group of integrated activities that could reasonably be considered when taken together, to constitute a project' [clause 5(2)].</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overriding objectives of this legislation are to provide security and certainty to industry. This is necessary to encourage major long term investments in value adding wood processing projects while at the same time protecting and conserving the environmental, cultural, heritage and social values of Australia's forests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In introducing this legislative reform to forest policy, the Government is establishing the policy framework to facilitate major investments in pulp and paper mills, integrated activities undertaken by an enterprise encompassing a range of commercial wood processing projects and, of course, large scale investments in plantations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the legislation, all projects must meet the following criteria (clauses 11 and 12)</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">an investment of at least $100 million for the purpose of producing goods from the project</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the dominant purpose of the project must be for export and/or import replacement</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the investment must be value adding</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">consideration must be given to plantation development</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">completion of an integrated up-front assessment to the satisfaction of Commonwealth Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any proponent seeking legislative resource security for integrated activities would have to satisfy two additional key requirements</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the entity undertaking the project meets the definition of an enterprise [clause 4(1)] and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">it would have to demonstrate that the activities are of an integrated nature [clause 5(2)].</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As regards the interpretation of enterprise in clause 5(1), the entity undertaking the project must be either a partnership, body corporate or joint venture as defined in clause 4(1). The legal definitions of `body corporate' or a `partnership' are well established.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The expression `joint venture' is not a technical one with a settled common law meaning. Its meaning is to be ascertained as a matter of ordinary language.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Joint ventures' include partnerships but are not limited to them. They also include a joint undertaking or activity carried out through a medium other than a partnership, such as a company, a trust, an agency or joint ownership. However, a `joint venture' is more than a set of activities conducted in contractual association.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Companies could be considered to be conducting a joint venture if, for example, their mutual arrangements contained provisions for</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">jointly building and maintaining facilities used in common;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">mutual leasing or use of machinery; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">some employees of each company were made available as needed to the others.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to integrated activities under clause 5(2), the Government recognises that the maximum benefit from the use of Australia's wood resources is often achieved through integrated logging and wood processing operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An integrated project could, for example, include a project involving investments in separate wood processing plants so as to maximise the economic value of the different qualities of logs harvested from a catchment area. In this instance, a project might consist of a veneer plant producing high quality veneer for plywood and furniture manufacture, one or more sawmills producing a wide range of value added timber products, and a flitch mill, with residues from all activities being directed into the production of pulp and paper. The project could be formed either through investments in greenfield processing plants or expansions of existing plants provided the whole project is subject to an up-front integrated assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, a mere collection of sawmills not integrated in the above terms and operated by separate companies would not qualify nor would any project involving predominantly woodchip exports based on native forests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will examine project proposals on a case-by-case basis. Any proponent of a project comprising `integrated activities' would need to detail the nature of the whole project and its component parts and the interrelationships between those components, in terms of the resource and product flows and the corporate or other arrangements. The relevant factors the Government will look at in determining whether a proposal meets the condition of being integrated activities include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">whether the wood resources for each activity are sourced from the same catchment area;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the nature of a commercial relationship between the entities undertaking the activities;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the economic interdependence between the activities; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">any technological relationship between project components or entities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With this approach to `integrated activities' and `enterprise', the Government believes that, provided the industry structures itself so as to meet the eligibility criteria in the Bill, almost all of the investment that industry has indicated is in prospect would be eligible for consideration by the Government.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Alan</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 16 April concerning the Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991 and your offer to discuss the legislation further. The attachment to the letter setting out the Government's policy position in relation to integrated activities under the Bill has been very helpful in enabling industry to assess the likely coverage of the legislation in its current form.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears likely that projects valued at $100m or more will be undertaken in Northern Tasmania and in Central Gippsland in the short to medium term and these should be able to be covered by the legislation. The legislation may also give impetus to a major plantation development in Western Australia. In addition, there may be other $100m plus projects in Southern Tasmania and East Gippsland later in this decade but these are not nearly well enough defined at this stage to commence the five stage approval process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This leaves the issue of how much of the industry will be covered under the `integrated activities' eligibility provisions. The attachment to your letter states that a `joint venture' is more than a set of activities conducted in contractual association. Therefore, given the diverse and highly competitive nature of the ownership and operations of the sawmill industry this sector could not meet the requirements for an `integrated activity' without a very major change to the normal commercial pattern of industry operations and development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this context, it is worth noting the view of the Resource Assessment Commission `that the primary role of Government should be to set policy parameters for forest use such as land use, zoning, codes of forest practice, environmental standards, log pricing and allocation of use rights. In relation to other aspects of forest management, the inquiry is of the view that the private sector should make decisions on the basis of its own assessment of commercial opportunities, risks and investment prospects. The private sector should also be free to determine the pattern of development of downstream industry, subject to planning and environmental requirements.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hardwood sawmilling provides about half Australia's domestic wood production and is a major regional employer in Queensland, NSW, Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia. Given the approach adopted by Government in relation to `integrated activities' and `enterprise' it is highly unlikely this diverse and competitive industry would be able to restructure itself to the extent envisaged by Government to meet the Bill's eligibility criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under these circumstances much of the prospective industry investment and employment would not be eligible under the current resource security legislation. Industry would therefore feel compelled to continue its campaign for legislation linked to accredited state forest industry development plans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our legal advisers are still strongly of the view that legislation provides the only `bankable' basis for investment in the industry. It was very noticeable at the public hearings on the legislation that virtually every witness, including Mr Michael Field and North Broken Hill Peko, stated that intergovernmental agreements are a totally unsatisfactory means to provide resource security. Under these conditions, industry could not support or endorse the current proposals that envisage intergovernmental agreements being the basis for resource security for most of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A meeting of NAFI Executive, including representatives of North Broken Hill and FIAT, was held in Melbourne on 10 April, primarily to review the resource security situation. The meeting agreed to promote two possible alternatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. request the Government to retitle the Bill for major forest projects and agree to pursue resource security for the rest of the industry in the context of the RAC recommendations and the National Forest Strategy.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, the Bill would become major projects legislation. Government would be requested to agree to continue negotiations with the industry on resource security on the basis of regional assessments backed by legislation in the context of developing the National Forest Strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. amend the current Bill to achieve resource security for accredited state forest industry development plans, possible by rewording definitions, or give a clearer broad interpretation to the integrated project approach so that it will incorporate most major forest investment and restructuring proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the North Broken Hill Peko proposal to provide scope within the legislation for the Government to vary the $100m limit by regulation could be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would be very grateful if we can discuss these alternatives at our meeting with you at 10.30 a.m Monday, 27 April.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning I rise to comment once again on the Forest Conservation and Development Bill, this time on the first clause, that is, the title to this legislation. That is what the problems have been about in the past 24 hours. We have attempted, and the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) has attempted, to make this legislation project specific and, had that been achieved&mdash;a relatively simple task&mdash;then those jobs would have been available in Tasmania. Therefore, it rests fairly and squarely on the shoulders of this Government. People in Tasmania are now saying that the Government's stance in the last 24 hours is a true indication that it never wanted this legislation in the first place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that disappointment runs extremely deep and painfully within me because, until yesterday afternoon, I and the rest of the coalition, particularly my Tasmanian colleagues, believed that after six months of discussions and debate the Government had finally been prepared to admit that part of its highly flawed resource security legislation is designed only for major projects and does not have anything to offer the rest of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Resources Minister had entered into negotiations with the coalition and with the industry and, contrary to what has been said here today, the understanding was that finally a suitable compromise had been found. Indeed, the coalition was prepared to pass the Bill as three elements of agreement had been found, and the Government, through the Resources Minister, had stated that it was now committed to opening up real and meaningful discussions with the industry and the unions to develop a concept of resource security on a State or regional basis which would cover smaller projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were prepared to accept the Government's commitment to monitor workings of the legislation and we were happy about the prospect of having the Bill renamed as a major projects Bill to more aptly reflect its project specific nature. What has happened? Why, on this side, are we all so disappointed? The Resources Minister goes to this Prime Minister (Mr Keating) with a compromise welcomed by both the Opposition and the industry, and is told that it is not acceptable. The Resources Minister has been unable to convince the Prime Minister and the left wing of the Cabinet to support the changes proposed to the legislation. Senator Cook, the Minister for Industrial Relations, has not denied that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that this very morning on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program the Minister used the excuse that the time was available in the Senate for debate and it was important that it go through. The Minister gave the impression that it was imperative that it go through the Senate as soon as possible, as the changes were minimal. I think that he referred to `a slot being available'. To the fullest extent of my knowledge, there is no rush on the part of the Senate to have this legislation passed in its present form. Indeed, the changes are minimal, but they are very significant. That is the point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, I would like to put on record that the Senate has not requested a cut-off motion on the debate on this Bill and there have been no cut-off notices given. The point that I wish to make is that there is no rush on the part of the Senate to have this Bill passed in its present form. In fact, there is no motion in relation to issues coming up from the other chamber which is operative as yet; I understand that the Democrats' motion has not yet been put. So I think it is rather a poor excuse to say that the slot is there, it must be debated and voted upon today. The opportunities are still available and will continue to be available. The motion does not relate to amendments which might be required by this part of the chamber which would go back to the other place, as frequently happens in relation to legislation. So the Minister really is trying to pull the wool over people's eyes about the urgency of this. There is something wrong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cook is now opening up a different point of the debate. I am raising the issue about the urgency and the excuse that was offered by Minister Griffiths on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program this morning. He was talking about slots available, and he was obviously referring to cut-off motions, the implications of that for legislation and the ability to debate them. The opportunity is still there for the Minister to take it back and to bring it to the Senate in an amended form. The Senate procedures and this side of the Senate are not denying the Minister that opportunity. There is still time to go off and refer it. But the Minister is not game because he knows what the outcome will be. He has tried to hide behind the procedures of the Senate and the forms of a motion, which has not been put, and he has incorrectly interpreted the significance of that motion. I think that is somewhat reprehensible.</PARA></TALK.START>

We now have a Prime Minister who does not back the Minister he appoints. I presume that the Minister would have a thorough knowledge of what is the best course of action. Indeed, this Prime Minister has embarrassed his own Minister by refusing to confirm his suggested changes. Given that this Bill has been around so long, the Prime Minister must have given him a degree of freedom to negotiate, and that is exactly what he did. The pressures came on after the event and caused severe embarrassment to Minister Griffiths. Where did that pressure come from?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of the internationalisation of financial markets, it happens from time to time that an exchange of information is necessary between foreign business regulators and their Australian counterparts. For example, many companies operate on an international basis. Undesirable market practices may operate across national borders; or a person prohibited from operating in one country's financial markets may try to move into those of another country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this can be pursued through voluntary agreements, there is a need to formalise cooperative arrangements. This has been recognised by the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), by the OECD in its review of the impact of internationalisation on financial markets, and by the Commonwealth Law Ministers at their meeting in Auckland in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill, which the coalition is supporting, provides for the Australian side of the process. It sets up a two-stage procedure for the provision of information by the Commonwealth to foreign business regulators. It is hoped that offering such assistance will put Australian regulators in a strong position when seeking similar assistance from foreign business regulators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The object of this Bill is set out in clause 5, and I think it is worth quoting in full:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The object of this Act is to enable Commonwealth regulators to render assistance to foreign regulators in their administration or enforcement of foreign business by obtaining from persons relevant information, documents and evidence and transmitting such information and evidence and copies of such documents to foreign regulators.</PARA>
<PARA>The scheme is designed to be sufficiently flexible to cope with requests from any type of foreign business regulatory agency and to ensure that requests for information are responded to quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important aspect of this Bill is that it complements the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act of 1987. If a foreign business regulatory agency is investigating an offence, it must seek assistance through that Act and not through the provisions contained in this Bill. Circumstances in which this Bill would apply include, for example, where information is sought in the process of deciding whether to allow a person into the market or where civil legal proceedings for market fraud or misconduct are being undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, the scheme set up in this Bill is essentially in two parts. The first part, set out in clause 6, consists of a foreign regulator making a request directly to a Commonwealth regulator on an agency-to-agency basis. Pursuant to clause 6(2), the foreign regulator is required to make an undertaking to the effect that the information and evidence to be sought by the Commonwealth regulator from a person will not be used against that person for the purposes of criminal proceedings. Clause 7 of the Bill provides that, where such a request is received by a Commonwealth regulator, that agency can either refuse the request or inform the Attorney-General that it does not oppose the request or that it does not oppose the request subject to specified conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The factors which the Commonwealth regulator must take into account when considering the requests are set out in subclause 7(3). They include whether the Commonwealth regulator is likely to be able to obtain the requested information, documents or evidence and the cost in so doing and whether the foreign regulator would be likely to comply with a similar request from the Commonwealth regulator. In the second stage of the process the Attorney-General must consider the requests referred to the Commonwealth regulator. The factors to which the Attorney-General must have regard in considering whether to authorise the provision of assistance are set out in subclause 8(2). They include whether it is in Australia's national interest to comply with the request, whether the request is consistent with international law and whether the information provided in response to the request might be used for prosecuting, punishing or otherwise harming a person because of that person's race, religion, nationality or political opinions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is of the view that perhaps another factor which the Attorney-General should be able to take into account is whether the foreign regulator has complied in the past with conditions and undertakings relating to the supply of information. However, we are prepared not to press this point at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pursuant to clause 9, the Attorney-General may also impose conditions subject to which material may be provided. If the request for information or assistance from a foreign regulator clears both these hurdles, the Commonwealth regulator may then serve written notice upon the person to whom the authorisation relates, requiring that person to provide information in the form of a signed instrument, or to produce documents or to give evidence before a person acting on behalf of the Commonwealth regulator. The coalition would also take the view that written notice should perhaps contain some indication of the matters to which the request relates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Witnesses will be able to be represented by a lawyer or other person who can assist&mdash;for example, an accountant&mdash;and legal professional privilege will apply. Clause 14 provides that, where a person claims that the information or evidence might tend to incriminate him or her, then it will not be admissible against that person in criminal proceedings or proceedings for the imposition of a penalty. The Liberal and National parties have concerns, also expressed by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, about the fact that clause 14 does not include derivative use immunity; that is, it would not protect the persons from their information or evidence being used against them indirectly. This is therefore an abrogation of the common law privilege against self-incrimination. As this question of derivative use immunity is shortly to be dealt with in detail in the Corporations Legislation (Evidence) Amendment Bill 1992, I will not be pursuing that any further at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand, from the debate on this Bill in the other place, that where information which is on the public record is required by a foreign business regulator, it will need to be sought through a memorandum of understanding between the regulators concerned. The passage of this Bill will not affect the necessity to secure such memorandums of understanding and we encourage the Government to continue to pursue them vigorously. This Bill has the commendable objective of improving international cooperation in business regulation, and although the coalition is concerned that the two-stage approval process is perhaps unnecessarily cumbersome, it nevertheless supports the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to make some remarks about the Constitutional Centenary Foundation, which was launched in Parliament House, Melbourne, on Thursday 11 April. In a little over eight years, Australia will complete its first 100 years as a nation. There will be much to celebrate. Our achievements have been many and among them the place of pride must be given to the Constitution, which has played a vital role in the progress of our people. Of course, the Constitution is not perfect. No constitution in the world is perfect and nor can any constitution in the world be made perfect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Practical men and women know that a democratic constitution can provide only the basic framework for fair government. It cannot, nor should it try to, tell us how we should live our lives. No constitution can tell us what education we should choose; what particular industries we should encourage: what foreign policies we should follow; how hard we should work; and, who we should choose as our friends. All these decisions must be left to our commonsense, to our wisdom, to our courage and to our imagination. If we lack these qualities, no constitution, however perfect it may seem in the eyes of the purists, can help us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What therefore can be said of the Constitutional Centenary Foundation at the early stages of its life? The aim of the Foundation is, in the words of Sir Ninian Stephen, its distinguished Chairman, `to encourage a public process of discussion and of review, of heightened awareness and better understanding of our Australian constitutional system'. On the face of it, this is an aim we could all agree with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education is always a good thing and educating the people to know more of the Constitution than they do is unquestionably always desirable. Senators must be aware, however, as doubtless is the Foundation, that there are many troublesome questions. For example, what does a heightened awareness and better understanding of the Australian Constitution mean? Does it simply mean a greater knowledge of the history, content, law and argument about the Constitution, in other words, the kind of education we should give or aim to give in our schools and universities, or is it intended to be an education for a particular purpose? If so, what purpose is it intended to serve: is it to make the citizens better informed to prepare them for another batch of referenda? It would be barely credible and indeed unfair to the Foundation if we were to assume that its purpose is to walk over the same grounds that the Constitutional Commission walked in 1988, or that its purpose is to achieve what the 1988 Constitutional Commission failed to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The massive problems created by the initial proposals of the costly Australian Bicentennial Authority, as well as the unprecedented failure of referenda submitted to the public in 1988, are still fresh in our minds. The distinguished board of the Foundation will undoubtedly avoid such obvious pitfalls. Nevertheless, we should recognise that there are philosophical assumptions underlying the research of the Foundation which are difficult to avoid. These assumptions in themselves will inevitably create debate. We do not want a constitutional foundation to be agnostic on issues such as federalism, responsible government and effective executive accountability to the Parliament. Even the selection of papers and authors themselves will reveal implicitly a philosophy about the type of constitutional change the Foundation gives some priority to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One issue that the Foundation will find difficult to avoid is a view on whether the Australian Constitution is basically sound, or hopelessly out of date and in need of major surgery. On the one hand, Sir Ninian praises Australia's great democratic record. At the same time the Foundation has a wide ranging program which could imply to some observers that a major rewrite is needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be said at this time that the Constitutional Centenary Foundation seems to be coming down hard on both sides of the fence on this important philosophical issue. The Foundation, in my view, must be careful to avoid promoting a monologue about the real or supposed problems in our Constitution. I think it would be useful initially if the Foundation could produce an early paper outlining Australia's constitutional achievements. Why is it that Australia has led the world in many important democratic initiatives? Why has Australia, in comparison with most other countries, been able to produce a stable democratic system enjoying widespread public support? Why have we been able to avoid the strains that have brought many other federations undone? Australians, as I have said, can rightly feel proud of their democratic achievements and the constitutional system that has given us stability few others know in a century of great change and great distress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such an analysis by the Foundation about our constitutional achievement might make some reference to and some study of the recent Canadian experiences of constitutional reform on a grand scale. In the late 1960s and early 1970s then Prime Minister Trudeau adopted the goal of strengthening the Canadian union and quelling the separatist movement in Quebec. To this end, he patriated the Canadian Constitution and amended it to include a charter of rights and freedoms akin to a Bill of Rights which the Constitutional Centenary Foundation has announced it will investigate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A key message from Canada's experience is reflected in the view of a well-regarded British weekly, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Economist</EMPHASIS>, that Canada's current problems with its federation stem from the constitutional adventurism of the Trudeau period. Next October Quebec will hold a referendum on secession from the Canadian Federation. I am told that, if Quebec leaves the federation, it is possible that British Columbia and Alberta will follow suit. I think we would all agree that it would be a great tragedy if that great nation was so split. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An issue the Foundation will find difficult to avoid is the attitude that it will take on the virtues or otherwise of constitutional gradualism. There is no doubt that the initial work program outlines a number of difficult and contentious issues. These include Bills of Rights, treaties with the Aboriginal people, powers of the head of state, separation of powers and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, Canada carries the message that wholesale constitutional reform or change, however well meaning, comes with substantial risks that the end result can be worse than the problems that the constitutional reformers seek to remedy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the Canadian experience demonstrates the virtue of what Professor Rufus Davis has referred to as `constitutional gradualism'. In this term, Professor Davis refers to the gradual development of constitutional practice and convention over time&mdash;such process as is no more clearly demonstrated by the example of Australia itself. It is true that our Constitution is supporting activities, endeavours and enterprises of a kind the founding fathers could never have foreseen. Yet, to the greater degree, it has performed the tasks asked of a constitution admirably well. On the whole, this is because the Australian Constitution has allowed a flexibility whilst ensuring that the main aim of a constitution, `to submit government to an agreed system of constraints', in the words of Professor Davis, has been fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Greg Craven, a reader in constitutional law at the University of Melbourne, makes a similar point when he warns about constitutional adventurism. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In renovating our constitution, we must be careful not to bring down a supporting beam. Constitutional reform is a painstaking and thoughtful process, and while we should not be frightened to discard a failed mechanism, we should be slow to make a fundamental change unless we are sure it is going to work.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the challenges facing the Foundation as it begins its work will be to decide which road it will take. With the example of Canada to guide us, one can hope that balanced, informed debate and a healthy observance of the gradualist approach will result in the avoidance of the pitfalls of radical constitutional change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Constitutional Foundation should be mindful of the degree to which any reforms considered necessary can be accommodated by changes outside the Constitution. A possible danger to the Constitutional Foundation is that major changes in the working of the federation can come about without constitutional amendment. Such issues include Federal-State relations, particularly of a financial nature, the role and effectiveness of our parliaments, including executive accountability and the roles of presiding officers, to name but two.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example of such an area of reform is that concerning Federal-State relations. As Premier Nick Greiner has observed in a speech in 1990 to the Press Club:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new constitution is not necessary in order for sensible reforms to take place in Commonwealth-State relations. The idea that we have to wait for constitutional lawyers to draft us a new constitution is a myth which should be exploded now.</PARA>
<PARA>Premier Greiner went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the possible exception of the section 90 prohibition on State excises, there is nothing in the Constitution that would prevent a transfer of functions and powers or stand in the way of remedying the fundamental problem of vertical fiscal imbalance.</PARA>
<PARA>Premier Greiner's comments on the issue of Federal-State relations, a current issue, that I have just quoted raise the wider question of federalism itself. This is another of the philosophical issues which the Foundation will find it very difficult to avoid. Do we wish to strengthen the States at the expense of the centre&mdash;in other words, giving better expression to the views of the founders of our Constitution and the founders of our nation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proponents of centralism and the States' righters will be able to produce reams of evidence supporting their respective positions. In the end, I believe, the argument will come down to a philosophical debate, which the Foundation will find difficult to avoid. It is a good start, in my view, that the Foundation has strongly supported a continuation of the federal system. However, does this mean that the legislative and fiscal independence of the States should be increased? It would be interesting to see to what extent the debate on renovating the States is furthered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happen to believe that a federal system is an effective way of dividing government power and limiting the damage that any government can do. At the end of the day, a Joan Kirner can muck up the schools in only one part of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world trend is to federalism. We tend to pretend in Australia that the trend is towards central government. The world of the twenty-first century may well be dominated by suprafederations&mdash;Western Europe, Russia and some of its neighbours. In commissioning papers and evaluating its proposals, the Constitutional Foundation cannot avoid taking a position on the issue of federalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, pointed out to me some time ago that Australia is arguably one of the world's oldest democratic constitutions, if not the world's oldest continuous democratic Constitution. This claim by Senator Tate is based on the fact that Australia and New Zealand were the first countries to introduce universal adult suffrage combined with the right of women to stand for parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have worked this Constitution for close to 100 years. In my view, that alone merits the title as one of the world's great constitutions and we should recognise, as we go towards the year 2001, our great constitutional achievement and be careful that we do not denigrate and possibly, by foolish change, destroy this great document. </PARA>

This list I have here&mdash;I will have to check&mdash;says 22 July 1990. I believe that is a misprint; it should be 1991. I will check that when I have finished answering the question.

If so, has the Minister ever been recorded as having made such a declaration or being the subject of deliberate absence?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Is the Minister aware of a review by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission of the enterprise bargaining principle established by the Commission in its October 1991 national wage case decision which is scheduled to commence on Friday, 1 May? Is the Minister anticipating that the ACTU will lodge a claim for a general wage rise at this review, as allowed for by the Commission's October decision?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1909" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The October last national wage case decision introduced principles for workplace bargaining into Australian wage fixing and made observations and suggestions, of which the Government has taken note, about changes to the legislative framework of the Industrial Relations Act which would facilitate workplace bargaining. I shortly will be proposing some measures to meet the observations that the Commission has made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission next month, in May, also will conduct a review of progress in Australian industry on the extent of workplace or enterprise bargaining in order to monitor developments. But in the October national wage case decision the Commission also said that the door would be open for parties to lodge an application for a general wage increase from 1 May 1992; that is, from tomorrow, the door swings open and any party can lodge an application for a general wage increase. The normal party to do that is the ACTU. If it did, the normal expectation would be that it would lodge an application tomorrow, a hearing probably would occur in June, a decision may be made in August, and possibly the decision would be prospective with an application date for an increase under a general wage round for September. It could be earlier than that, but that is a reasonable possible scenario for what could happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that this will not occur for the reason that the Government and the ACTU have a wages policy and have worked out an approach on wages. The approach we have worked out with the ACTU followed hard upon the heels of the Prime Minister's One Nation statement&mdash;a statement aimed at stimulating economic growth in Australia and creating further jobs, and aimed at locking in a low level of inflation in this country. As a wages policy approach it ought to be contrasted to that of the Opposition, which is a total free-for-all in the market. The Government's is a disciplined and considered wages policy approach. Therefore, in the immediate future Australian workers can look forward to pursuing further wage increases through workplace or enterprise bargaining; that is, through productivity negotiations generating further productivity in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACTU and the Government have agreed that the priority is to lock in the low level of inflation that Australia has experienced as a permanent feature of our economy. The big `0' was reported by the Treasurer yesterday for the March quarter, leading to an annual rate of 1.7 for Australia, which in terms of inflation puts us well below the OECD level and makes us the second lowest OECD country in the world. The objective is to lock that level in as a permanent feature of the economy. Therefore, an application by the ACTU for a national wage round is deferred. It will not make one, thus allowing job stimulation by the One Nation statement, preventing inflation growing and giving workplace or enterprise bargaining a chance to spread more widely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government and the ACTU will later agree on timing and on an amount for a national wage case increase. We believe that there should be not only stimulation to productivity bargaining but also attention to fairness in wages. People in poor bargaining positions who do not have access to productivity negotiations should be able to get a wage increase for a general round in the economy. So we will agree with the ACTU on timing and amount for a future national wage case increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, that ought to be contrasted against a free-for-all wage round that would apply under the Opposition. The last such free-for-all under the Fraser Government led to a wages explosion in this economy. The thing that this Government has been able to deliver, which the Opposition can never even approach, ne'er promise, is that we have a wages policy that works, that delivers an outcome, that is effective and that maintains a household disposable income in relative terms for ordinary Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that this morning Mr Reith made a statement on Channel 9 to that effect. He said, `You always get low inflation in a recession'. Once again, he has shown a complete ignorance of the facts. If the leadership of the Liberal Party is any indication of the `followership', I am not surprised that Mr Reith made a substantial error in respect of that matter. When I raised this issue in Question Time in the Senate yesterday, everybody said, `Oh, that was a few years ago' and all that sort of stuff. The problem with members of the Opposition is that they are all refugees from the 1970s. They have a very selective memory about what happened in that period. Mr Reith, who is not only the shadow Treasurer but also the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party for goodness sake, said this on television this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before going to Mr Reith's ignorance&mdash;about which I could wax eloquent for some time&mdash;let me say that the facts are that the latest CPI figures confirm that this country has returned to low inflation. CPI inflation is now down to 1.7 per cent, which is below the latest average of our annual inflation rate of our trading partners at 2.5 per cent. The underlying rate, excluding volatile and seasonal factors, is now down to about 3 per cent for the year to the March quarter. This is the lowest underlying inflation rate since the series was first constructed in 1971. The latest CPI figure supports revised official forecasts of reduced inflation for 1991-92 and 1992-93.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That may not be good news for members of the Opposition who, as I said yesterday, get very excited about bad news because bad news is their only opportunity&mdash;wallowing in ignorance as they do about these matters&mdash;to get their backsides on these seats over here. When the unemployment rate goes up, the Opposition gets very excited; when the CPI goes down, it gets miserable. That is the indicator of the Opposition's political knowledge and political success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that inflationary expectations have come down, indicating that the community accepts that low inflation is sustainable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Federal Government has taken a key and very welcome step towards bringing conditions on our Indian Ocean territories of Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands up to the standard of those in Australia. I would have to give very significant credit for this to my colleague in the House of Representatives, the honourable member for the Northern Territory, Warren Snowdon, who lobbied very hard and, in fact, made frequent visits to the territories prior to this being done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories recently announced a major infrastructure program for Christmas Island to upgrade living standards and create 400 jobs. I regret to say&mdash;and it has become a very disturbing pattern lately when any significant Commonwealth money is directed towards northern Australia&mdash;that this was immediately attacked by Senator Tambling. I have here a transcript of what Senator Tambling said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will recall that Senator Tambling was only recently complaining bitterly about the Commonwealth Government instituting studies instead of actually putting money in. That was his complaint a few days ago. But this is what he said about the upgrading of capital works on Christmas Island:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would rather see that assessment made by either the Grants Commission or the Public Works Committee rather than the Government jumping in and committing large amounts of money in advance of doing a study to work out what is the appropriate need and relativities. It seems to be someone's pet project.</PARA>
<PARA>It is nothing of the sort. These very important facilities at Christmas Island&mdash;as Senator Tambling knows himself, having been there&mdash;are literally falling down. My colleague the Minister for Territories announced the program in a press statement on 26 March, more than a fortnight before Senator Tambling made his public statement. Senator Tambling clearly did not even bother to read that statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement, which I have a copy of here and which I will provide to Senator Tambling later, clearly states that $37m&mdash;that is, the initial stage of this allocation&mdash;has been allocated to the most urgent of capital works, as I said, such as the new hospital, the upgrade of the sewerage and water supply works, a new police station, an extension to the school and an upgrade of the housing on Christmas Island&mdash;in other words, the very projects which Senator Tambling himself in his public statement conceded were necessary.</PARA>

It is obvious that Senator Tambling needs to do just a little more homework himself before he continues to continually knock this Government's program of northern development.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the last few years I have seen a 6 per cent increase in productivity growth in New Zealand compared to less than one per cent in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The next time Dr Hewson goes overseas to criticise the performance of Australians, whether they be companies or workers, he should get his facts straight. To criticise Australian companies and workers to a foreign audience, while also getting the facts wrong, in order to make a political point is an abomination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the New Zealand Department of Statistics does not publish an official series on productivity in New Zealand. There is no official statistician in New Zealand to publish figures on productivity, so Dr Hewson could not have been relying on any official publication for the figure of 6 per cent. However, the OECD did make a calculation of New Zealand productivity growth, and it calculated New Zealand productivity for the 1991 calendar year as a negative&mdash;minus 0.9 per cent. So, according to the OECD, there was negative productivity growth. According to the OECD's calculation for 1990, there was a positive growth in productivity in New Zealand of 0.9 per cent. So there was a plus of 0.9 per cent for 1990 and a negative of 0.9 per cent for 1991. Therefore, Dr Hewson's claim of 6 per cent productivity growth in New Zealand cannot be substantiated if one has regard to the OECD calculations as a benchmark.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the purpose of Dr Hewson misrepresenting&mdash;and, apparently, deliberately so when one looks at the official statistics&mdash;the productivity performance of Australian workers as compared with the productivity performance of New Zealand workers, particularly when one has regard to the draconian industrial relations circumstances of that country? One can only speculate about that, but it does appear that Dr Hewson wants to tailor the facts to fit his arguments&mdash;to push Australia down the New Zealand industrial relations road and pretend that there is some benefit in the New Zealand system when the figures show that there is a negative to justify his industrial relations policy. He claims this policy as the centrepiece of his consumption tax package, yet in the whole 600 pages of his consumption tax package there are only two pages on industrial relations, both of which are devoted to cutting expenditure and programs in my Department.</PARA>

It is also reported that the Danish Minister was putting pressure on Australia to conclude a new agreement on EC beef exports. Could the Minister tell the Senate whether Mr Crean has struck a deal or is considering a deal which would alter the Andriessen agreement, considering that the Andriessen agreement is vitally important to the Australian beef industry and the EC would not be able to compete in the Japanese export market without export subsidies?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can now give an answer concerning conflict of interest, which has been a matter of some import in here in recent times. ABC radio's regional program manager for the Kimberley, Mr George Manning, was nominated to stand for a position on the Broome Shire Council in the local government election.

The ABC cannot legally intervene or interfere in an election process which is under way and has not sought to do so. Mr Manning reviewed his position and independently decided to withdraw from the election. As his nomination had already been accepted under the Western Australian Local Government Act, he found he was unable to withdraw and is required to see the election process through.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A significant component of any nation's science and technology base is its system of major national research facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia currently has six such research facilities, including the Australia Telescope, the Oceanographic Research Vessel <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Franklin</EMPHASIS>, and the Australian Animal Health Laboratory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Major advances in science and technology increasingly depend on research workers having access to the type of complex and expensive equipment contained in these facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However their high cost, in terms of establishment and maintenance, is often beyond the resources of individual institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to a request from the then Prime Minister, ASTEC investigated this issue and produced what is a very important report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Major National Research Facilities:  A National Program, recommends that a program of major national research facilities be established.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would provide for the consideration of new major research facilities proposals, phasing-out of facilities that no longer satisfy national needs and priorities, and access to major research facilities overseas where such access is an appropriate alternative to the creation of an Australia-based facility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of its report, ASTEC established assessment criteria to enable proposals for funding to be judged in terms of their benefits to science and technology and to the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Using its criteria, the report listed some 15 likely candidates for major facilities over the next five to 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among these proposed facilities is an upgrade of the Australia Telescope, a new Marine Geoscience Research Vessel, a Mining Materials Research facility and a Tropical Marine Research Network.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ASTEC report notes that a further process of rigorous evaluation will be necessary before any decision can be made to proceed with any of these.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must emphasise this point.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any hasty decisions on new facilities would be inimical to the spirit of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, members will note that one of the facilities recommend for further investigation is a new Hi-flux Research Reactor to replace the existing reactor at Lucas Heights. No decision will be taken on the establishment of such a facility without an inquiry process consistent with the decision of last year's ALP National Conference.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ANIMAL WELFARE ON CULLING OF LARGE FERAL ANIMALS IN THE NORTHERN TERRITORY </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PREAMBLE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare on Culling of Large Feral Animals in the Northern Territory, tabled on 21 June 1991, is the eighth report of the Committee and addresses the significant problems encountered in the Northern Territory with feral animals. The Government is now in a position to respond to the report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report contains ten (10) recommendations which form the basis for improvement in welfare aspects of controlling feral animals. Despite the restrictive terms of reference for the inquiry, reflected in the title of the report, the Committee's conclusions and recommendations  apply to management of introduced animal pests throughout Australia. The word "feral" should, therefore, be taken in the context of the Government response, to apply to all introduced animal pests, and not in its more restrictive sense of members of a domestic species which have reverted to a wild state.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's feral animal population poses a major problem. Feral animals cause serious damage to agricultural production by competing with livestock, they can be extremely harmful to the environment, and they are a potential major reservoir for endemic diseases, such as brucellosis and tuberculosis, and exotic diseases, for example foot and mouth disease. For these reasons it is essential that effective steps be taken to control the impact of feral animals in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years Governments have been confronted with many conflicting considerations regarding feral animal control. These include the historical and sentimental value of camels and horses (particularly the descendants of the "walers", a generic name applied to the stock-horse types widely used as cavalry mounts, originally for the British Army in India), the commercial value of pigs, and the tourist potential of horses, buffalo and camels. The views of Aborigines, who control a large percentage of Northern Territory land and utilise feral animals, need to be incorporated in decision making. Cost/benefit analyses should be undertaken to ensure that a rational approach is taken, and the humaneness of control methods also has to be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The control of vertebrate pests is one of several Australian animal welfare issues which have assumed international significance. The Commonwealth Government receives many letters of complaint from overseas countries, particularly Europe and the United States, about the perceived inhumaneness of vertebrate pest management in Australia. International concern directed at Australia as a whole has  the potential to tarnish our image abroad. It also has the potential to affect our trade in goods and services, not only in direct action against items such as fox skins and kangaroo products, but through consumer boycotts against other goods and even the tourist industry. Apart from the kangaroo cull, which is outside the scope of this report as it involves a native species, the issue which has attracted most criticism, both from within Australia and abroad, is helicopter shooting of feral horses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public attitudes to pest management and associated welfare issues are often based on incomplete or misleading information and are strongly influenced by perception and emotion. However, there is an increasing expectation within the general community that people involved with animals&mdash;whether in livestock production, research, or pest management&mdash;must pay greater attention to animal welfare, and the general public is demanding to be included in the process for deciding what is acceptable. It is in the interests of the authorities responsible for implementing pest control programs, and of those with an interest in the outcome of those programs, to ensure that the process is as transparent as possible and that the public is able to express its views from an informed position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the existence of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare was extended to enable it to undertake an inquiry into the welfare implications of culling feral animals is an indication of the seriousness with which the Government views this issue. The Senate Select Committee's report provides an objective assessment of the major concerns and proposes some measures for addressing them. It is essential for Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments, conservation and animal welfare interest groups, livestock producers, Aboriginal communities and other parties with an interest in the issue, to work together to address the feral animal problem in a way which takes into account the many different views, concerns and objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Senate Select Committee mentioned, the question of animal welfare in relation to management of introduced animals has been addressed by the National Consultative Committee on Animal Welfare (NCCAW), which advises the Commonwealth Government, through the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, on animal welfare issues of national significance. The control of feral animals was referred to NCCAW by the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy as a major issue which needed to be considered from an animal welfare perspective. NCCAW established a working group comprising experts in the field of vertebrate pest management, as well as representatives of producer and animal welfare interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report, the working group concluded that pest control will need to be based on currently available methods for the foreseeable future, but that these methods need to be reviewed with regard to humaneness and, where necessary, refined or replaced by more humane methods. It also concluded that more objective and reliable methods of assessing pain and distress in animals need to be developed and that pest control needs to be placed on a more rational basis by assessing the  impact of pest species and the long term costs and benefits of current approaches to their control. The report has recently been made available as a reference document.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is aware that efforts are currently being made to develop humane culling methods, and it wishes to encourage the initiatives of organisations which are involved in such research. A New South Wales Pastoral Protection Board, for example, in response to the increased use of helicopter shooting of feral animals over the last few years, is conducting research (an assessment into various types of ballistics) to determine the most suitable, single, type of round.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need for control programs to be planned, systematic and sustained. They should also be co-ordinated with surrounding landholders and community programs. One-off and sporadic control measures must be discouraged. It is important, also, to realise that elimination of feral animals is only possible in very restricted environments, such as islands, or where an intensive, co-ordinated national effort is made, such as in the Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign&mdash;a program which has virtually eliminated feral cattle and buffalo but at a great cost to both the Government and the livestock industry. The use of the term "control" instead of "elimination" is more appropriate as it reflects achievable aims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the auspices of the Vertebrate Pest Committee of the Standing Committee on Agriculture, the Bureau of Rural Resources (within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy) is implementing a project to develop national strategies for the co-ordinated management of the major vertebrate pests in Australia. This approach will be developed and implemented on a national basis and in consultation with all interested parties including the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments, the community, conservation and animal welfare groups, and industry. The development of these strategies will be overseen by a working group which consists of representatives of the Vertebrate Pests Committee, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the National Farmers' Federation, and the Standing Committee on Conservation of the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of the recommendations contained in the Senate Select Committee's report will be partly addressed in the context of the Bureau's project. The Government notes, however, that the above mentioned working group does not include a representative of an animal welfare body.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is concerned that the mustering and long distance transport of feral horses does have the potential to cause welfare problems. However, continuation of integrated feral horse control programs initiated by landholders rely on the revenue generated by the sale of captured horses. If controls arising from animal welfare concerns become too restrictive and increase costs of transport, the resolve of  landholders to continue control efforts could be reduced. As a longer term measure, the Government would prefer to see mobile abattoirs and field shooting for game and pet meat, substituted to the extent possible for long distance transport to abattoirs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bureau of Rural Resources issued a report on the Welfare of Horses Being Transported in November 1990, the recommendations of which were considered by the Senate Select Committee in its deliberations. The report outlines the need for further research to establish the particular conditions most suited for horse transport. Generally, the recommendations offer the potential for improving the conditions of all horses being transported, without limiting the focus to feral horses only.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A joint Commonwealth/State/Northern Territory Task Force has partially completed investigating the options for a uniform volume loading regime for the transport of livestock by road. It is expected that this work will be passed to the National Road Transport Commission for its consideration and completion as appropriate. The Government considers that as consignors of animals demand that value loss from bruising, maiming and death in transit does not occur, livestock transporters are generally acutely aware of the need to load to acceptable limits in a real business sense, as they require continuity of trade to survive. It is aware, however, that such commercial considerations are not always sufficient to prevent welfare problems arising.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government wishes to encourage the adoption of a nationally consistent approach to the management of vertebrate pests. The responsibility for deciding whether or not to implement many of the Senate Select Committee's recommendations, however, rests with State and Territory Governments. The relevant recommendations have therefore been referred to State and Territory Ministers of Agriculture through the Australian Agricultural Council at its meeting in February 1992. That Council will henceforth be known as the Agricultural Council of Australia and New Zealand.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommends that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy publish Model Codes of Practice on Animal Welfare in a more compact, durable and professional format.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government agrees that the national model codes of practice should be properly published. The Standing Committee on  Agriculture (SCA) decided in 1989 that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) would be responsible for publishing the codes as part of the SCA Technical Report series. CSIRO has since published six codes in an updated format. The remaining codes, which are currently under review, and any new codes, will also be published in a similar format.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Model codes of practice are usually modified by State and Territory Governments to better suit local situations. Dissemination of these codes is undertaken by States and Territories as they have legislative responsibility for animal welfare.

One of the aims of the strategies will be to identify where additional research or other studies are required. The rural industries research and development corporations and councils under the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio, which are funded jointly by the Commonwealth Government and the relevant industries, support some research into the impact and control of vertebrate pests.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously. This inquiry was one of the last that the then Select Committee on Animal Welfare conducted. It was quite controversial. The inquiry was brought about as a result of unfavourable publicity we received overseas and locally, particularly through the television media, about the culling of horses and buffalo.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pity that Senator Cooney is not here, because we conducted a wide-ranging inquiry into this. We came to the conclusion that there was only one way in which we could protect the native flora and fauna of northern Australia: that is, by the eradication of horses, buffalo and other feral animals, no matter how distasteful it may seem. I can understand the reactions of people when they see photographs of horses being shot. Articles on this have appeared quite regularly on television and in the print media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee had many representations from concerned citizens about cruelty to animals and the possibility of injuring them during this culling. Nevertheless, in the interests of retaining our native flora and fauna, particularly the bilby, we came to that conclusion. I am surprised that the Australian Democrats are not here&mdash;they have been quite vocal with respect to the bilby. The bilby population used to extend from Western Australia to Victoria and into the Northern Territory. Their numbers have shrunk quite considerably and these unique animals are now found in very small pockets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has occurred because they have had tremendous competition from feral animals, particularly horses. We looked at the culling of wild horses in and around Alice Springs; we inspected a horse abattoir at Peterborough in South Australia; we had quite intensive investigations into the methods of shooting horses, particularly from helicopters. We came to the conclusion that there was no alternative to helicopter shooting for the eradication of these wild horses. There are other methods, of course, such as mustering. At the end of the day, to get the numbers of wild horses sufficiently reduced to limit the risk to the native animals, the terrain is such that there is no other humane way of doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Patterson asked me a while ago what I know about Walers. Senator Brownhill would know that they were one of the major reasons why this investigation was taken on board. `Walers' is a generic name that was applied to stockhorse types that were used in the Middle East during the First World War. Anzac Day in Hobart brought back memories of the Walers because a particular contingent of returned servicemen marched with some horses purported to be Walers&mdash;or at least they were decked out as Walers. They were not Walers because there are no Walers as such left in Australia at the moment. However, there may be some descendants who have interbred with the local brumbies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Make no mistake about it: whilst these animals and other wild animals may seem attractive, the feral animal problem&mdash;not just horses and buffalo but also wild pigs and camels; the introduced animal species abounding northern Australia in great numbers&mdash;is horrific. It is probably one of the most disastrous states of affairs as far as our native flora and fauna are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that the Government has responded to our report. I note that it supports some of our recommendations. For example, we recommended that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, in consultation with other members of the Australian Agricultural Council, review the continued use of feral horses in the export horse meat industry. We were concerned that some of the practices involved in this industry were not in the best interests of the animals. There was certainly some cruelty in evidence.

Domestic animals have started to run riot in this country and they are doing enormous damage to our environment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague says that it is horrific, and I agree with that word. Something has to be done about this situation. We must start in our cities. Our State governments must be required to take action on domestic dogs and cats. I make no bones about this matter. I say clearly where I stand. I believe that all such animals should be required to be registered. Those held as domestic animals for friendship purposes ought to have a low registration fee of, say, $5 per annum. One of the conditions of registration ought to be that all domestic animals be de-sexed. Any such animal which is not de-sexed and which is held for breeding purposes ought to have an annual registration fee of about $100 per annum. That would ensure that the animal's owners are using it properly and are paying the monetary penalty for holding such an animal. These conditions should ensure that such animals do not run astray.</PARA></TALK.START>

In those circumstances it would perhaps be unfair to continue to charge a fee of $100 a year. After the owner has paid an annual registration fee for five years, such animals could be kept at the lower rate. By then they would have become pets that would be kept in people's homes.

Those people affected by the requirement to resign from an office of profit under the Crown before nominating for election to the Parliament of the Commonwealth, for which they are subsequently unsuccessful, have their employment and entitlements protected by suitable legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">&mdash;Recommendations 10-11 propose that the constitutional phrase `office of profit under the Crown', which prevents a person from standing for election, be defined by legislation,  that persons who hold such an office should resign before nomination, and that the employment and entitlements of such persons should be protected. The Attorney-General's Department has advised that a definition in legislation cannot resolve the uncertainty about the meaning of the phrase used in the Constitution. This issue is a complex one that was the subject of considerable discussion in the 1981 Report by the Senate  Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs entitled "The Constitutional Qualifications of Members of  Parliament". That Report pointed out the definitional problems associated with the interpretation of section 44(iv) of the Constitution. It is generally accepted that Commonwealth, State and Territory public servants, employees of some (but not all) Commonwealth statutory authorities, some statutory  office holders and members of the Defence Forces are considered to hold an "office of profit" within the meaning of section 44(iv). While it is straightforward to provide that such officers resign before nomination, several problems arise with the proposal that the reinstatement of such officers be guaranteed. In particular, problems arise with the reinstatement of statutory office holders in relation to the sensitivity of some positions. It is already the case that  the Public Service Act 1922 currently protects the employment  and entitlements of public service officers (except Secretaries and unattached Secretaries) and the Defence (Parliamentary Candidates) Act 1969 provides for discretionary reinstatement of Defence Forces personnel who resign to contest elections. The Government considers that those officers generally accepted to hold an `office of profit under the Crown' should be required to resign before nominating, including State and Territory officers, in accordance with the accepted interpretation of section 44(iv)  of the Constitution. The Government does not consider that Commonwealth legislation should provide that State or Territory officers have their employment and entitlements protected if unsuccessful. The State and Territory Governments are to be approached with a view to the introduction of complementary legislation with regard to reinstatement rights. The Government supports the alternative to the Committee's proposal whereby specified Commonwealth, State and Territory public service officers, statutory office holders and employees of statutory authorities and members of the Defence Forces (that is those officers generally accepted to hold an office of profit under the Crown) must resign before nominating. Further consideration will be given to the reinstatement rights of affected officers in addition to those provisions that currently apply.</PARA>

While this proposal has merit, its implementation would create considerable problems with the  joint roll arrangements with the States. Each State  government would have to enact complementary legislation for   such "provisional" enrolment to effect both Commonwealth and State enrolment. In the absence of complementary legislation, such "provisional" enrolment would only apply for Commonwealth purposes and new citizens enrolled under this scheme would be required to enrol again for State purposes. Such a requirement  would be needlessly bureaucratic.

No matter what words those opposite may mouth, this delay reflects very badly on the Government.

Of course, the voting system is vital to a continuation of democracy of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to comment on a few of the recommendations because they are important, and one of them in particular has real relevance at this time. However, before I do that I note that many of these recommendations have already been incorporated in amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act, and I repeat that I find it extraordinary that it took two years or more for the Government to respond to this Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee itself is bipartisan; it is a joint committee of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. From reading the report&mdash;and when I said `bipartisan', I meant it&mdash;it is clear that there were determined efforts by the members of that Committee to improve, where possible, the voting system as a result of the 1987 election. However, there is one point that needs particular attention&mdash;in fact, it came up in an amendment to the Electoral Act last year, I believe, because I can recall debating it&mdash;and that is the attempt to define those people who hold an office of profit under the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a constitutional requirement and&mdash;again, if my memory is correct&mdash;we did attempt to introduce some amendments to define an office of profit under the Crown and were advised that the difficulties involved were such that definition may bring about further problems. My understanding was that the Government was going to look at it further through the Attorney-General's Department to see whether it could come up with a definition. By way of example, I cite my own situation prior to coming into this place when I was the Deputy Chairman of the Queensland Institute of Technology. That was a non-paying job but, on legal advice received at the time I was appointed to the Senate, I did not take any risk because, even though no pay was involved, it could well be classified as an office of profit under the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This question was again raised by the recent amendments to the Electoral Act. I believe that the Opposition did move for an amendment but that it was blocked because of this definitional difficulty. I may be incorrect about that; I am just speaking from memory. However, I think it is very relevant because Mr Cleary, who was recently elected as the member for Wills, is under challenge on this very matter of holding an office of profit under the Crown. I will not go further, except to say that sooner or later we will have to define it to get rid of the uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the thing that concerns most people, whether they be candidates or even members&mdash;the uncertainty relating to it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were other recommendations which I believe that the Government should have accepted. One was recommendation 21:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Electoral Commission and the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs work in conjunction to formulate and implement a system for checking the citizenship of persons born overseas and seeking to be added to the Electoral Roll.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has knocked back that recommendation because it believes that such checking could be resource intensive and `hamstrung by incomplete records'. That term is a worry. I do not really know what it means, but I think `hamstrung by incomplete records' means that the act of applying for enrolment should be a more stringent procedure. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great concern about declaration voting. The important thing about the voting system is to be sure of the electoral roll so that people cannot cheat during election campaigns. We always hear complaints&mdash;and I am sure that the Minister would probably receive more complaints than I do&mdash;after an election which, in the main, cannot be substantiated.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Generally, when those charges are made they relate to people from the government side of politics. A recommendation was made for nomination forms to be amended to require candidates to state their membership of any registered political party and that a penalty would be incurred if a candidate failed to state his or her membership of any registered political party. The reason for that recommendation was presumably to stop the phoney candidates. We have always suspected phoney candidates in many instances, the so-called independents who run mainly for the Labor Party. In my recollection it happened recently in Queensland, which you would recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, in a by-election for a State seat&mdash;I think it was in Nundah. The incumbent Labor member ran off and was found somewhere in a motel in Lismore. As a result there was a by-election and the person who ran as a so-called independent green was considered to be a member of the Labor Party. The purpose of the recommendation was to make it clear that a person should state his party membership or suffer a penalty of $6,000.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 37 is quite an extraordinary one. It states that an infringement notice system should be introduced to replace the present system of enforcement of compulsory voting. This is quite curious. It is already an amendment to the Act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find this extraordinary. I know why the Electoral Commissioner has looked at it because it means that it will be easier to collect the money.

This raises the whole question of sensibility in a free society of compulsory voting. </PARA>

I am quoting from memory but, if my memory is correct, Senator Bolkus, the Minister for Administrative Services, made the remark that it would disenfranchise voters. Mr Wayne Swan, the Secretary of the Labor Party in Brisbane, said that it was a sinister attack on democracy. What an extraordinary statement.

There would not be an honourable member or senator who does not get this concern expressed to him or her. As I mentioned earlier, Senator Bishop has raised this issue on a number of occasions in the past. The recommendation comes from 1987 and shows the great interest of the Labor Party in the democratic process. We have had an election since this recommendation has come down.

The recommendation goes on to say that the proposal will only be effective if polling officials are authorised to question the voter on his or her supposed death. The recommendation does not talk about supposed death. It talks about `the names of those voters believed to be dead but for which no official advice has been received'. The recommendation talks about strain on polling officials and the difficulty in seeing how the supposed dead person could be prevented from voting if he or she insisted. I am sure that could be easily addressed. It would simply be a matter of getting some sort of identification at the time. Even though people say this would be some sort of invasion of privacy, when a report is in that a person who was supposedly on the roll is dead and turns up to vote, for goodness sake, there is something awfully wrong with our system if something does not exist that enables officers to check it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I move this motion with some concern about the lateness of the annual report of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. The report was for the year to June 1991 and is dated 13 April 1992. I might say that the report has been expeditiously sent by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) to the Parliament. The delay, according to the Chairperson of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, has been due to the need to comply with the new guidelines for financial statements for Commonwealth entities issued by the Minister for Finance in 1991. I can understand those delays. A real problem, however, is the Auditor-General's report, which dramatises expenditure relating to $194m and has brought this response from the Auditor-General:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been unable to determine whether all this expenditure is valid and I do not express an opinion on this item.</PARA>
<PARA>That is $194m of taxpayers' money. The Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Note 5 to the statements, the Commission acknowledges that due to inadequacies in its accounts and records it is unable to verify that all expenditure relating to Community Development Employment Projects ($194,101,000) has been made in respect of eligible participants resident in the relevant Community.</PARA>
<PARA>This obviously has been a factor in the report's delay, but I foreshadow that it is the Opposition's intention to refer this incredible situation to a relevant parliamentary committee to examine why this extraordinary situation obtains. I also mention that there are some other less significant problems: for example, Baruwei Enterprises Proprietary Ltd has not presented financial statements for the year ended June 30 1991. The Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . its statements have not been included in the group financial statements. Therefore the consolidated financial statements do not comply with the relevant accounting standards of AAS 24 (Consolidated Financial Statements). The financial effect on the consolidated financial statements of this cannot be quantified.</PARA>
<PARA>The report also notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The audit report on Morr Morr Pastoral Company Pty Ltd was qualified because, as indicated in Note 1 (1) to the group statements, the Company did not conduct a stocktake at 30 June 1991. Accordingly, I was unable to attest the value of the livestock held at 30 June.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This qualification did not have a material effect on the group accounts as at 30 June 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that there are real difficulties involved in accounting for this very significant program. The Government's attempts to resolve the problem have clearly not been satisfactory; they have not been satisfactorily resolved. The notes to the account say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CDEP funding involves an obligation on the part of communities to provide regular participant schedules to the Commission. Some Communities have experienced difficulties meeting this obligation and the Commission has therefore been unable to verify that all payments to communities have been based on accurate participant schedules. To assist in overcoming this verification problem, a new administrative system, designed to enhance verification procedures, was implemented on 1 April 1991. Under the new system, CDEP grantees are required to provide the Commission with a quarterly schedule, listing all participants, four weeks before the beginning of a quarter or with a monthly scheduled two weeks before the beginning of a month. The schedule must be accompanied by a certification, signed by the chairperson of the organisation or authorised employee, stating that all of those persons whose names are listed in the schedule, are eligible to participate in the scheme. In addition, the Commission is planning to undertake a complete census of CDEP communities in 1992, and introduce new monitoring procedures aimed at further improving the level of accountability.</PARA>

<PARA>This long awaited report No. 19 from the Industry Commission into the Australian sugar industry certainly is not the answer to the sugar industry and the problems it is currently facing. As one of Queensland's senators, I believe it is very important that I speak to this report today. The report, promised in 1988, has been presented at a time when many sugar growers are facing virtual bankruptcy due to this Government's unfair and discriminatory taxes and legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the report does not provide any hope for those in the sugar industry, as it seeks to abolish tariffs without providing any truly adequate assistance measures. I have always believed that it is no good reducing tariffs if the Government does not provide reasonable and fair assistance to the growers in other ways. Tariff cuts without reforms in industrial relations and the waterfront and reductions in fuel excise and tax, such as those proposed in the coalition's Fightback package, will only reduce sugar growers to peasants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the recess I had the opportunity to spend a week in north Queensland travelling around, meeting many groups and individuals and hearing personally of their current problems. I was told again and again of the struggle many people in rural areas are facing. Those in the sugar industry talked of the problems they face because they have had to battle with reduced production as a result of droughts and floods which cost them $300m last year. In addition, they have had to battle with accelerated tariff cuts which cost the industry $16m last year and will cost a further $14m this year. There has been a third reduction in this year's US quota to 109,671 tonnes and this means a loss of $18m. This is far below the 800,000 tonnes exported to the United States prior to the introduction of the quota in 1981. In addition, the growers have suffered from depressed world prices because of subsidies and overproduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, the industry is experiencing its worst season since 1979, with 1991 returns reduced by 25 per cent despite record expansion. This is evidenced by the fact that 48,000 hectares of expansion has not been taken up. Most growers are in their second or third years of negative income and they are suffering from increasing input costs and low production and returns as a result of droughts and floods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, sugar growers are forced to operate on corrupted world markets. They are expected to compete with the treasuries of the United States and the European Community. Government intervention and volatile world prices are the central characteristics of the world sugar market. All other sugar producing countries have one or more forms of support, such as guaranteed cane prices, domestic prices, quotas or import bans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Japan, the EC and the United States cause the major distortions on the world sugar market. The tariff situation in Japan is a tariff equivalent of 360.43 per cent. In the European Community it is 170 per cent and in the United States it is 102 per cent. In the EC there is a guaranteed price of $551 per tonne or 26c a pound. In the US the guaranteed price is $357 per tonne or 23c a pound and in Thailand it is $447 per tonne or 20c a pound. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was amazed to learn on a recent trip to Maryborough that currently this Government is, as part of its overseas aid program, providing assistance for Australia to build a sugar mill for Thailand. The sugar mill to be sent to Thailand will be paid for by our taxes, including the taxes of sugar growers, and that country will then subsidise its sugar producers at the rate of $447 per tonne. That mill will be used to encourage the growth of an industry which in turn will result in putting Australians out of work. How ridiculous can we get! How ridiculous it is to place our faith in blind, crass economic theories!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no good saying to the sugar industry that, because we are on the altar of free trade, because we want to be able to hold our hands on our hearts and say to the Europeans, the Americans and the Japanese that we are acting as we believe they should act, we will be in a better position to ensure that they do so. Unfortunately, we are placing a number of our major industries in a position where there will be even more unemployment. We will find that imports will take over the sugar industry's market share.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reality, following the total reorganisation of the industry two years ago, expansion now takes place at an annual rate of 2.5 per cent. This is something the Commission makes no acknowledgment of. Presently, 48,000 hectares of land that is available for cane growing under the present system has not been taken up by anyone, either established growers or newcomers to the industry. Expansion involves major investment, which is a recipe to go broke at the present time when high interest rates of the Labor Government have deterred investment. The industry is exposed to corrupt world prices which are below the cost of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of the Commission's perception, the industry has worked enormously hard to increase efficiencies to wear the tag of one of the most efficient and low cost producers in the world. It has adopted such initiatives as bulk handling, efficient marketing systems and industry owned and financed transport systems. It is a world leader in technology and research. Efficient new industrial practices, such as continuous crushing, and environmentally advanced methods of green harvesting and trash blanketing have been adopted by growers and millers alike. There are many towns right along the coast of Queensland and northern New South Wales which are supported and sustained by the sugar industry, as are many manufacturing industries and world class sugar research institutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report recommends abolishing compulsory acquisition so as to promote competition among the sellers and reduce the price of raw sugar to around export parity prices. In spite of the efficiencies achieved by single desk selling in holding premium markets, ensuring quality and guaranteed supplies&mdash;with all the world's export markets consisting of single desk buyers&mdash;there is also the question of what export parity price really is. Export parity price is set by the 20 per cent residue of other producers&mdash;that is, producers from such places as the EC and Thailand&mdash;with every one of them subsidising its producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report acknowledges that the EC common sugar policy enabled the EC to go from a net importer to the world's second largest exporter. Intervention prices of 39c a pound currently exist, while the world price is 9.5c a pound. Export subsidies are given from the EC budget. In the US the quota is solely aimed at supporting the US producer at around 23c a pound. In Thailand, our least protected competitor, the Government sets the domestic price, bans imports and controls exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IC wants to destroy our industry by exposing it to world export prices which are based on subsidies and not on the cost of production.

All of the other reports put out by the Industry Commission, with the exception of the one on the car industry, came to the same conclusion&mdash;that all protection should be dismantled and all regulation should be dispensed with. The only reason that the car industry was spared from a zero tariff regime by the year 2000 was that the original draft report of the Commission, which recommended 15 per cent by 1996, was doctored at the behest of the Government. So, there is one precedent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By 1998 there will be no tariffs on sugar nor will there be a guaranteed market for the sugar growers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the evidence for this contention of stimulating activity and employment? There is an economic model which tells us. This is the Orani food model which was used in these calculations after making the heroic assumptions that, because of tariff phase-outs, there will be a 30 per cent increase in land under sugar cultivation and a 9 per cent reduction in on-farm costs. As the report states at page 151, if there is no reduction in farm costs there will not be any economy-wide gains. But, as the previous speakers have said, why would farmers expand their sugar output by acquiring more land when the price they receive on the domestic market will be reduced by about $76 per tonne from the current level? We are going to say to them, `Go out and produce more but you will get less for it'. It just does not make sense. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Briefly, it is neither pure capitalism nor pure socialism, but a mixture of both. Initially, it was structured by caring Labor governments in the early part of this century, long before there was a National Party. Ironically, then issues of both defence and immigration were of concern. Initiatives were needed to populate North Queensland as the majority of people preferred to live in Brisbane, Sydney or Melbourne, and it was feared that an empty north would invite invasion. The sugar industry was initially structured on the plantation principle, and these were owned by overseas landlords.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These plantations were cut up into family sized farms, and as an incentive, a guarantee was given for the purchase of a certain amount of cane from each farm each year. This amount eventually became the peak, and a basic peak could keep a family as in a basic wage.

<PARA>That is a very interesting comment. Then it goes on to say that if the report were adopted, there would be a substantial increase in the quantity of land in Australia which was being farmed for sugar.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One study estimated that economy-wide employment would increase by at least 3,000 if the size of the industry was not constrained by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to talk about the possibility of the area of land under cane expanding  by 30 per cent. That then leads to the suggested increase in the value of output and exports by around $375m annually. </PARA>

That organisation has made itself into a magnificent company&mdash;so good that even Mr Keating, on page 50 of his One Nation statement, got around to quoting the results that ICI is producing at Botany.

We want it to grow.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that during the 1982-83 economic recession, retention rates to Year 12 remained relatively static. Since retention rates have risen significantly during the current recession, this suggests that the availability of AUSTUDY may have had a positive impact on the number of students continuing on at school.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt about that; it is a recognition of what has happened. In many instances Austudy has become an alternative to the dole. Young people who are unemployed are quite rightly being encouraged to go back to school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact remains that the Australian Bureau of Statistics youth unemployment figures are much lower and do not fully reflect the real unemployment level for the reason that this report outlines. Austudy is being used in this recession as a way of hiding the true level of youth unemployment, which is horrific enough. One in three of the young people aged between 15 and 19 wanting a full time job are unable to find one; one in four of those who are prepared to put up with part-time jobs are unable to find one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that Austudy is a great help to people with lower socio-economic backgrounds. In a recent survey of 1,800 parents, one third considered that they would be unable to send their children to school if they were not receiving Austudy. This dramatises the fact that young people from low socio-economic backgrounds are being hit hardest by this recession that we had to have. Instead of being on unemployment benefits, they are not shown as being unemployed because they are accepting Austudy and going back, hopefully, to increase their job options as a result of increasing their skill levels. </PARA>

<PARA>This report&mdash;the Auditor-General's audit report No. 28, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Project Audit, Australian Taxation Office, Prescribed Payments System</EMPHASIS>&mdash;was in response to recommendation 38 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on the reform of the Australian Audit Office. That recommendation stated that the Auditor-General should devote significant resources to follow up performance audits and adopt a systematic approach to such findings. There was a performance audit of the Tax Office in September 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, Senator Watson and Senator Bishop, who are both on the Public Accounts Committee and who had hoped to participate in this debate, are obliged to attend a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee this afternoon.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson has every right to participate in this debate. At a recent Estimates committee hearing he raised some matters about the way in which the Australian Taxation Office was handling the prescribed payments system. An officer of the ATO, Mr Highfield, in a quite disparaging way, suggested to Senator Watson that he had a lot of misconceptions. In an answer to Senator Watson, Mr Highfield said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>. . . this also relates to a number of other misconceptions that seem to be reflected in other questions that you have raised.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General has a very good response to Mr Highfield on Senator Watson's behalf. There are no misconceptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the recommendations that the Australian National Audit Office has made about this. The audit objectives were to review progress with the implementation of the recommendations of the efficiency audit; the audit also assessed the current management systems and administration of the prescribed payment system; and a major focus of the audit was on Australian Taxation Office enforcement activity. One of the findings states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Payer enforcement reports highlighted credit and debit discrepancies, failure to remit cases and payers under-deducting the correct rate of tax. The reports are supplemented by audit activity which currently focuses mainly on failure to deduct cases.</PARA>
<PARA>Another of the findings states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian National Audit Office considered that there was a strong need to develop national and more effective payer enforcement strategies. This would require increased audit activity, modifications to the computer system and the enhancement of various reports.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet another of the findings states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The PPS database was recording a large number of cases as unidentified creditors. The value of these creditors was $129m for the 1990 income tax year. These records represent tax credits with invalid or mis-keyed tax file numbers. The ANAO considered that the ATO should attempt to reduce this balance by identifying and actioning high value cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will briefly go through the key findings of the report. Recommendation 8 of the efficiency audit, on which this report is based, was mainly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to implement stronger inspection activity to enforce PPS requirements . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General established that recommendation 8 had not been fully implemented. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the ATO reported increased inspection activity in 1988, the ANAO considered audit inspection activity was low during 1989 and 1990 and recommended that the audit coverage of PPS payers be increased. The ATO considered, however, that the efficiency audit recommendation had been implemented through the refinement of enforcement strategies and that present PPS audit coverage was properly balanced to maximise coverage across all revenue lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another finding was that although a range of PPS management information was available, there was no automated facility for the evaluation of PPS processing activities against performance standards. Other findings include: a need to develop national and more effective PPS payer enforcement strategies; income matching checks on PPS payees could be enhanced by implementing national case selection standards; nationally promulgated procedures had not been issued for key PPS processing activities; and there were inconsistent practices between branch offices in the use of PPS generated information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Audit Office has made a series of recommendations which, if implemented, it believes should enhance the performance of the prescribed payments system and lead to the identification of additional taxation revenue. As I say, that is a very brief comment on the key findings. Senator Watson in particular asked me to commend the Audit Office for proceeding with this follow-up report arising out of its efficiency audit. I commend the Audit Office's recommendations to the Senate. </PARA>

That was a very important recommendation to implement stronger inspection activity to enforce PPS requirements. The fact that that has not been fully implemented has important consequences.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that I will not go over all the detail that Senator Baume covered, the main point I want to stress yet again in this place is the essential role of the Australian National Audit Office in providing an independent and highly professional evaluation of the performance of government functions.

For that reason, I continually commend the Audit Office for its work, and also for that reason, I yet again condemn the Government for the inordinate delay it has introduced in the implementation of the major rewrite of the audit legislation that it undertook several years ago, and which was supposed to be in operation on 1 July this year. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first two recommendations cover management and organisation. The Centre has two governing bodies, a Policy Advisory Council and a Board of Management. The Policy Advisory Council provides advice to the Minister regarding:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">agricultural problems of developing countries; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">programs and policies with respect to agricultural research for either or both of the following purposes,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) identifying agricultural problems of developing countries; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) finding solutions to agricultural problems of developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Membership of the Council currently consists of a President, the Director of the Centre, the person for the time being occupying, or performing the duties of, the Director-General of the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau, and not fewer than 12 nor more than 16 other members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Board of Management of the Centre is responsible for the conduct and control of the affairs of the Centre. It consists of the President of the Council, the Director of the Centre, the person for the time being occupying, or performing the duties of, the Director-General of the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau, and 3 other members appointed by the Governor-General from among the members of the Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes there is scope for a reduction in the membership of the Policy Advisory Council and that the membership of Australians and non-Australians should be equal. Furthermore, the Committee believes there should be some degree of flexibility in AIDAB representation on both bodies. To this end Recommendation 1 covers an amendment to section 8(1)(c) of the ACIAR Act dealing with AIDAB representation on the ACIAR Board of Management and Recommendation 2 recommends an amendment to section 19 dealing with the membership of the Policy Advisory Council including AIDAB representation. The size of the Council is to be reduced to 12 and half the Council members are to be residents of countries other than Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee, in its 3rd recommendation, recommends that the quorum requirement for a meeting of the Policy Advisory Committee be reduced from 9 to 7 and that the President have a deliberative and casting vote.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to ACIAR's research program the Committee has made 4 recommendations. The Committee supports ACIAR's primary focus on South East Asia and the South Pacific. However, the Committee recommends that as funding permits, ACIAR should foster collaborative projects of mutual importance to other parts of the world, including Africa, the Middle East and South America. North Africa and the Middle East, in particular, should be a priority because of Australia's expertise in dryland farming.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important for ACIAR and its contracted organisations to have some flexibility in determining the length of stay of Australian scientists in-country. The Committee recommends that ACIAR in conjunction with its commissioned organisations and partner institutions continue to evaluate the length of stay of Australian scientists in-country on a project by project basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although ACIAR's research program activities have been successful, improvement is still possible in several areas. Project length is currently 3 years, but in some cases this has not been sufficient. The Committee recommends that ACIAR be more flexible in determining project length, allowing projects to be approved on a case by case basis for periods of between 3 to 5 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been some difficulties in the past relations between ACIAR research program co-ordinators and Australian scientists in the commissioned organisations. While most problems could be described as personality driven, rather than institutional, the Committee sees merit in ACIAR setting out clear guidelines governing the relationship between ACIAR and the commissioned Australian research institutions, and detailing the relevant responsibilities of each position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee looked closely at the question of the economic returns to the partner countries from the annual expenditure by ACIAR of $17-18 million per year. The figures, which ACIAR provided the Committee, based on an economic assessment of the costs and returns of 12 research projects are very impressive. Based on these 12 research projects alone, ACIAR claims that for a total research cost of $27.4 million (1990 dollars) the expected benefits over the next 15-20 years would be $816.7 million (1990 dollars).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was rigorous in its questioning of the basis of the cost benefit analysis, but even with a sizeable error factor built in, the Committee acknowledges that the outcome of ACIAR's research to date has, at the very least, proved cost efficient, unlike a number of projects undertaken under the general aid program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to funding the Committee has made 3 recommendations. The Committee was satisfied that the financial operations and measures, to ensure accountability, were sufficiently rigorous to ensure that the disposal of its funds were in keeping with the objectives for which they were appropriated. The Committee noted the Auditor-General's concerns over the question of financial delegations, and the related issues of payments into the Trust Fund and the types of financial statements required at present. The Committee recommends amendment to the ACIAR Act as a matter of urgency to rectify these technical problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the success of ACIAR's work and the fact that funding levels have remained in the range of 1.3 to 1.48 per cent of total official development assistance, the Committee believes there is room for a significant increase in the budget allocation for ACIAR. The Committee therefore recommends that ACIAR's priority within the aid budget be increased, and that by 1997 approximately 3.5 per cent of the aid budget should be allocated to ACIAR.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACIAR does not meet the full cost of some of its activities for the Australian commissioned organisations. The Committee agrees that there needs to be clear guidelines established, detailing what will and will not be funded by ACIAR and therefore recommends that the ACIAR Board of Management formalise and issue a policy on the matter of overheads and cost recovery for the information and guidance of Australian collaborative institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The relationship with ACIAR and AIDAB is long standing and extensive and appears to be of mutual benefit. Similarly, relations between ACIAR and its commissioned organisations and their partner institutions are generally productive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although Australia contributes to the core funding of International Agricultural Research Centres, there has been a significant decline in our contributions since 1986 and the current allocation of $7.4 million is equivalent to approximately one half of one per cent of the total aid budget. These contributions are administered by AIDAB, but ACIAR has a close working relationship with these Centres. The Committee makes two recommendations on relations with other organisations:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, that funding for the International Agricultural Research Centres, together with the resources needed to administer these funds, be transferred from AIDAB to ACIAR; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, the Committee further recommends that the funding for the International Agricultural Research Centres is to be additional to the increase in ACIAR core funding recommended earlier (in Recommendation 9); and that the level of International Agricultural Research Centre core funding be increased to 1.5 per cent of total official development assistance over 5 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under its Terms of Reference the Committee was charged to examine `the desirability or otherwise of the continued existence of the Centre as a Statutory Authority after the expiration of twelve years of operations (June 1994), the maximum length of existence specified in the current Act'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was unanimous in its opinion that ACIAR should continue and that it should retain its statutory authority status within the foreign affairs and trade portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While sympathetic to ACIAR's wish to have the uncertainties of the sunset clause removed, there was a strongly held view on the Committee that the existence of a sunset clause had distinct advantages. Indeed, the Committee is of the view that greater use should be made of sunset clauses to review the performance of all statutory bodies. The role of sunset clauses for statutory authorities should be the subject of examination and the Committee recommends that the appropriate Parliamentary Committee inquire into the role of sunset clauses for statutory authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As other statutory authorities do not have sunset clauses, ACIAR argued that it could see no reason why it should be treated in a totally different way to any other statutory body created.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was a strong belief on the Committee that there was considerable benefit in retaining the sunset clause as it kept the organisation at a high level of performance with the achievement of excellent results. On equity grounds the Committee does not recommend the imposition of a further sunset clause on ACIAR. However, to ensure the continued strong performance of the organisation, the Committee does recommend that the new Act to continue ACIAR include a fundamental review, every 5 years, of ACIAR's Terms of Reference including the continued existence of the organisation; and that the review of ACIAR be carried out by a Parliamentary Committee as this will assist in achieving greater public awareness of the value of ACIAR's work; and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is the appropriate body to conduct such a review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The mandate of the Centre is closely defined, with functions such as training and extension programs precluded from its activities. The Committee has made four recommendations which are in essence an extension of ACIAR's charter. On the training side, the Committee recommends that the ACIAR Act be revised to allow ACIAR to conduct project-related training (both informal and post-graduate); and that responsibility for the administration of ACIAR's training scheme together with the concomitant resources, be transferred from AIDAB to ACIAR.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to the utilisation of research results the Committee recommends that AIDAB establish a Technical Advisory Committee with the task of monitoring ACIAR research projects to enable earlier identification of results that could be developed through the AIDAB program. The Technical Advisory Committee should be chaired by the Director, Country Programs, AIDAB and should include representatives from ACIAR as well as AIDAB.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Committee was conscious that there will be times when valuable research results will not be taken up by AIDAB in projects. Therefore, the Committee recommends that, when AIDAB has declined to conduct a follow up project utilising ACIAR research results, ACIAR should have the option of extending the post-project phase to include a small pilot program, with Board of Management approval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was put to the Committee that the charter should be expanded to allow ACIAR to become involved in extending research and development assistance in non-agricultural sectors. The Committee does not agree that ACIAR is the most appropriate body to conduct this and recommends that the Australian Government examine the possibility of establishing an organisation along the same lines as ACIAR with the purpose of providing research and development assistance to regional countries in manufacturing systems, human resource development, etc.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACIAR has to be one of the best kept secrets. As mentioned the work of ACIAR is almost completely unknown outside the field of those involved in agricultural research.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first press article I have seen reporting ACIAR's work was published in The Australian on Tuesday 21 April 1992. The article reports on the work of Dr Philip Larkin and Dr Phillip Banks of the CSIRO Division of Plant Industry on the use of biotechnology to provide resistance in wheat to barley yellow dwarf virus. The project to find wheat plants resistant to barley yellow dwarf virus was done in collaboration with colleagues at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. The benefit of this work is that all wheat-growing countries stand to gain from this unique research that will for the first time permit control of this universally serious virus.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's final recommendation addresses the lack of public awareness and recommends that ACIAR consult with AIDAB on ways to increase public awareness of the importance and achievements of ACIAR's work in solving major agricultural problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Committee found the ACIAR inquiry to be a positive one because the Centre is such a `good news' story. I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">REPORT ON THE VISIT OF THE DEFENCE SUB-COMMITTEE OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DEFENCE AND TRADE TO NURRUNGAR-WOOMERA AND NORTHERN TERRITORY, OCTOBER 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Defence Sub-Committee has a long tradition of inspecting Defence establishments and units across Australia. In line with this tradition, last October the Defence Sub-Committee inspected the Joint Defence Facilities at Nurrungar and Pine Gap and several Defence establishments in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision by the Defence Sub-Committee to visit northern Australia reflects the recent focus of defence planners on the north. In August the Sub-Committee conducted the first phase of its inspections of northern defence establishments when it visited north Queensland and the Torres Strait. This report describes the second phase of the Sub-Committee's inspections in the north.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This visit coincided with the final stages of the Sub-Committee's inquiry into Australian Defence Force Reserves. The inquiry benefited from the opportunity for the Sub-Committee to inspect the Reserve force, NORFORCE, which is one of three RFSUs (Regional Force Surveillance Units) located in Northern Australia. NORFORCE was raised on 1 July 1981 to provide a tactical ground surveillance capability of the Top End. It is unique among Army Reserve units because it is on 28 days notice to move for operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Sub-Committee inspected soldiers of the Darwin Squadron, NORFORCE, based on Melville and Bathurst Islands. Members were impressed by both the high calibre of the Reserve soldiers and the high standard of the unit. The inspections of NORFORCE resulted in Members of the Sub-Committee gaining a wider appreciation of Reserve operations in the difficult conditions of the north.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The visit to the Northern Territory provided opportunities for the Sub-Committee to inspect RAAF Bases Tindal and Darwin. We were briefed on the respective roles of these two bases. Some concern was expressed to the Sub-Committee that some projects had been delayed as a result of uncertainty about the future of RAAF Base Darwin in light of the role ascribed to Tindal. The view was put to the Sub-Committee that RAAF Base Darwin can only be defended from Darwin&mdash;this cannot effectively be done from Tindal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Sub-Committee was made aware that some concerns are held, firstly, about the impact of civilianisation in the particular situation of the Darwin base being located in a cyclone and, secondly, about the impact of DRSR (Defence Regional Support Review) on operational readiness at Darwin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given  the expansion of the Defence presence in northern Australia, the Sub-Committee was briefed on recent developments in the north by the Commander Northern Command, Brigadier Frank Hickling. We were told about the impact of the Force Structure Review on the northern area with respect to the continuing build-up of defence strength, particularly through the relocation of 2 Cavalry Regiment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The briefing given by the Naval Officer Commanding Northern Australia, Captain Tim Lewis, complemented the briefings on surveillance of the northern coastline provided during the Sub-Committee's earlier trip to north Queensland. The Sub-Committee gained an appreciation of some of the difficulties encountered in patrolling northern waters and the ease with which fishing boats could be successfully camouflaged in the mangroves of estuarine waters was clearly demonstrated to us.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Sub-Committee's itinerary included the Joint Facilities at Nurrungar and Pine Gap. While Members appreciated the opportunity to see facilities at first-hand, it should be noted that the Sub-Committee received an unclassified briefing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Sub-Committee was very concerned to find that publicly available printed knowledge of the Joint Facilities exceeded the information which was made available to the Sub-Committee during the briefing. Indeed, the Sub-Committee noted that information appearing on the Congressional Record in the United States is not officially made available to Australian Members of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At Nurrungar, the Sub-Committee was told that there has been a significant change made to the position of the Deputy Commander, who is the Government of Australia Representative&mdash;the Deputy Commander is now fully briefed and therefore in a position to take over fully the Joint Defence Facility Nurrungar. The Sub-Committee observed, however, that the change in the position of the Government of Australia Representative was not reflected in the relationship which exists between the Minister and the media with respect to public disclosure of information. Information publicly available in Australia does not parallel that which is publicly available in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nonetheless, the Sub-Committee is appreciative of the efforts made by all concerned in the arrangements for the inspections and for the opportunities provided for informal discussions. Members are also grateful to the Minister for Defence for making available the special purpose aircraft to the Sub-Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the elements in the tabling statement expresses the unanimous concern of the members of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade at the level of the briefings available to them at the joint defence facilities. Quite bluntly, we heard nothing there that was not available from the popular press. In contrast, United States senators and members of similar committees apparently have available to them far deeper briefings. Certainly, the publications of their committees in the US Congress are a very valuable source of detailed, technical information. These reports often form the basis for what Australian authors write on the joint defence facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to remain on the narrow point of the availability of information from the joint defence facilities to the Defence Subcommittee of the Australian Parliament. I will move to the wider field of the availability of information relating to intelligence matters to senators and members of the Australian Parliament. This has always been an interest of mine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me state the position: no such information is made available to members of the Australian Parliament through any formal channels. Ministers who have responsibility for certain agencies&mdash;namely the Minister for Defence, for the Defence Signals Directorate and the Defence Intelligence Agency; the Attorney-General, for ASIO; the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, for ASIS&mdash;are fully briefed by their relevant agencies, and Cabinet committees have briefings where relevant. On occasions, the entire Cabinet or even the whole Ministry will be briefed. There is nothing else available on a regular basis to members of the Australian Parliament. This conforms to the basic rule of intelligence, which is: there is a need to know and if one does not have a need to know, one is not informed. The system we follow in the Australian Parliament fulfils and satisfies that requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My personal view is that that is unsatisfactory. I believe it is important that the Parliament has some knowledge of and access to intelligence information. The very great difficulty is how it should be done. I am very conscious of the colleagueship, the innate equality, of all honourable senators within this chamber. It is an equality that denies the President of the Senate the right to have a casting vote, which would be the normal procedure under the standing orders of most bodies, in the event of a tied vote. That is how far we take our equality. Nevertheless, it is clearly impractical to have open access to all intelligence information to the Parliament as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Different countries approach this matter in different ways. Leaving out the totalitarian regimes, which do not transmit anything to their token parliaments, the democracies have a range of practices which cover the whole spectrum&mdash;from total denial of information to full disclosure. As far as I am aware, the parliament of the United Kingdom has no intelligence committees of any sort and no regular channels of communication. The United States Congress has a number of committees which have access to information and one of them which I had some experience with&mdash;the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence&mdash;characterises the range of information that is available. They have full and complete access to all information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will state briefly why I find the present system unsatisfactory. As I said before, it has always been my belief that it is not in the best interests of the Parliament to deny access to this sort of information. I have refrained from speaking on this matter for a number of years because I recognise the great complexity of the issue and the fact that there is no simple answer to it. I raise this matter this afternoon in the hope that it will initiate some discussion in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first point is that, as members of parliament, we are fully accountable for the expenditure of all public moneys. If no-one, apart from the Minister, knows what the various intelligence agencies are doing, no-one in the Parliament can truthfully account to the public for the expenditure of that money. Secondly, information has to be shared so that opinions can be formed and decisions made by informed minds. At the end of the day, information is collected to be used, not to be hoarded. To take an extreme case, a senator could quite genuinely, but in ignorance, propose some policy or campaign publicly for something which was clearly against the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My third point is that, in our system, the executive government is responsible to the Parliament for the exercise of its authority. It therefore follows that it is proper for the Parliament to be informed on intelligence matters. As I said before, there are no regular channels in this Parliament for that to take place. It could be argued that the Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, set up under the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act, provides such a channel for one sort of intelligence. In my experience as a former and recent member of that Committee, it does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the access to information has to be restricted to a select few. That causes some problems in a democratic parliament, but I can see no other solution. It is not unreasonable to assume that any senator wishing to serve on a committee which receives this information should apply for and obtain a security clearance at the highest rating. I do not wish, at this stage, to take the matter any further, but it is a matter of concern. As the longest serving member of the defence sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, there have been numerous occasions on which the availability of briefings at an adequate level of secrecy has affected the operation of that Committee and its ability to form a judgment on some issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular point which led me to speak this afternoon on this matter was the fact that information is made available more freely to my foreign counterparts than it is to members of the Committee on which I serve. We feel that that is an unjust imposition on the members of the Australian Parliament. But as I said earlier, I think the issue is considerably wider than the joint defence facilities. It applies to all intelligence gathering agencies, not only those in the defence field. It is a matter which I respectfully bring before the Senate in the hope that, if the matter is discussed in a mature way, some advance can be made on the present situation. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>This is the first report of the Honeybee Research and Development Council. I pay tribute to Dr Max Whitten, the Chairman of this relatively new body. Dr Whitten, the head of the Department of Entomology at the CSIRO, has made an enormous contribution to his area over many years. In particular, he has done an enormous amount for the beekeepers and the honey industry of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bees are no different from any other livestock and the treatment they get is much the same. It is all a matter of breeding and feeding, the development of strains, disease determination, the provision of superior stock, and market development. It is just the same as any other livestock based industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honey industry is small and deals with small animals, it does not get nearly as much publicity as it should. The value of pollination alone in rural industries is estimated at between $600m and $1,200m to the farmers. The pollination advantages are very great. The beekeepers have paid a levy of 0.5c per kilogram on all their honey exports as from 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry always has some conflict of interest with farmers, sawmillers and various other people. There always seems to be a problem with scrub clearance, blackberry eradication, Paterson's curse elimination and so on. Understanding of the industry is improving: the farmers in particular are fully aware that it is necessary to have the bees adequately fed and housed. Provision is now being made much more regularly for the beekeepers to be able to provide adequate shelter and coverage for their stock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honey industry in Australia is not enormously large. At the time of this report, the Research and Development Council was involved with 36 projects. The budget for those projects was $360,000 for the year. While it is not a very big industry and while it is one that usually proceeds without much fuss, I do pay tribute to it and, particularly, to Max Whitten, the Chairman of the Council. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the Anti-Dumping Authority on its annual report and the work that it does in investigating and identifying areas of goods dumped onto the Australian market. Page 5 of the report notes:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under current Australian law, the Government may take action against only one kind of dumping: that is, which causes or threatens material injury to the Australian industry producing like goods to those being dumped, or which materially hinders the establishment of such an industry. And a broadly similar rule applies in the case of subsidisation.</PARA>
<PARA>In the year of investigation, the Anti-Dumping Authority looked into a wide range of cases ranging from cooling systems, pasta, carpet backing, pipe fittings, canned ham, lead acid storage batteries, vinyl floor sheeting, sodium cyanide and plaster of paris bandages. I do not know too much about many of those goods, but I do know a little about the wide range of horticultural goods which are currently being dumped onto the Australian domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On many occasions my colleague Senator Boswell has raised this issue and spoken of the plight of many farmers who not only have to fight the rural crisis but also see their products competing in the supermarket shelves with goods dumped from overseas. I am pleased that I have been able to speak on this issue on the various occasions when Senator Boswell has raised it in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the midst of the crisis currently hitting our rural community, Australia is importing more than $2 billion worth of food products every year. Australian horticultural products are fast becoming an endangered species. The list is growing every week. First it was pineapples; now it is bananas, canned fruit, peanuts, navy beans, peas, beetroot, beans, potatoes and other vegetables, as well as apricots, dried vine fruits, rice, orange juice, apple juice, jams, mushrooms, dairy products and fresh meat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One industry which is still suffering from dumped goods is the peanut industry. That is an industry that I know very well because many growers in my home district are centred on Kingaroy. The peanut industry has not been able to convince the Authority of its plight. In February this year I moved a motion condemning the Government for its refusal to implement anti-dumping and countervailing measures against the dumping of Chinese peanuts on the Australian market. The Australian Customs inquiry into the importation of the Chinese peanuts established that these imports have increased 300 per cent in the past three years. It admitted that the cheaper imports were being dumped and that Australian producers were suffering as a result. It also admitted that these actions were having a serious impact on Queensland's $30m a year peanut industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, tests on the Chinese peanuts have identified high levels of chemical residues, which are illegal in the Australian industry. The thing that annoys me very much is that some of these imported Chinese peanuts are being mixed with good Australian peanuts by some firms which then try to promote them as Australian peanuts. That is very wrong. The Government should take immediate action to halt the importation of these peanuts and thus provide a fair go for Australian peanut farmers instead of support for those in China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, a whole smorgasbord of imported food is entering our market as subsidised products. At the same time, our farmers are having to plough back their products into the soil. This problem is not just one for farmers. I can understand housewives who, under current economic circumstances, try to buy the cheapest products when shopping. Who can blame them when we have seen our household incomes seriously eroded since this Government came to power? Many of those households now face life on the dole as unemployment rises steadily. Of course, any sensible shopper tries to cut costs by buying cheaper brands, but with many of these dumped brands the products are not as tasty nor as nutritious as Australian grown fruit and vegetables. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Most housewives would know that Australian grown and processed products guarantee the best quality in the world. When I go home on the weekend in between the sittings of the Senate and do my shopping, I certainly like to buy Australian products. Our goods are grown under strict guidelines and processed under high standards of hygiene using the best and most advanced technology available. But we have to remember that it is not only the farmers but also the people who live and work in the community who can be affected. There is an entire support network servicing the farmers and their products. I am pleased to have been able to speak to the report of the Anti-Dumping Authority today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to say a few words on the Anti-Dumping Authority's annual report of 1990-91. I note that the report says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority's primary reason for existence is to recommend to its Minister whether or not he should take anti-dumping action. Such action usually takes the form of imposing special duties on imports into Australia of specified goods from specified overseas suppliers.</PARA>
<PARA>Other points are made in the report which I think should be explained to some of the people at large so they know how the Authority works and how many references have been received in the last year. Nineteen references were received by the Authority during the year under review compared with 10 in 1988-89 and 17 in 1989-90. While these 19 references each result in a formal report by the Authority, they cover just 11 commodities in total. Senator Bjelke-Petersen has already made a point about those commodities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> My major concern relating to the dumping legislation is that&mdash;this point is made in the report&mdash;Customs must by law reach a prima facie case decision within 35 days of the receipt of an application. That application has to be a formal application that the goods were being dumped or subsidised resulting in material injury being caused or threatened to the Australian industry producing like goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that that time has been shortened, and the Government has announced that it will be shortened again to 25 days, which will be a great help for people in industries who do have a complaint. If that decision is in favour of the applicant, Customs then accepts the complaint and proceeds to investigate it. Customs then reaches a preliminary finding on whether dumping or subsidisation has caused or is threatening material injury. That finding has to come in within 100 days. If that finding too is in favour of the complainant, that is the Australian complainant, Customs may, and usually does, put provisional anti-dumping or countervailing measures in place. On receipt of such reference, Customs calls for further submissions for which the Authority allows another 40 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Authority can send officers overseas for discussions with the producers and exporters of the allegedly dumped goods and may ask the overseas representatives of the Australian Customs Service to undertake any necessary investigations overseas on behalf of the Authority. The report must by law be sent to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce within 120 days of the receipt of the reference to Customs. But all this happens too slowly because 120 days is nearly four months, which is a long time for a company to sustain dumping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently one company brought to my notice the example of sun-dried tomatoes. I refer to a couple of points that were made in the letter that I have in my hands. The company refers to the most unbelievable situation related to the recent granting of anti-dumping action approved by the Federal Government in respect of canned tomatoes imported from Italy, Spain, Thailand and China. This company was aware at the time that the canned tomato industry applied for anti-dumping provisions and advised Customs that similar damage to its industry was occurring at the same time. The company sought to join the canning industry in supporting the anti-dumping applications, particularly as the products affected both industries in terms of goods entering Australia under the same time tariff item for classification. The companies were advised though at the time that this was not technically possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously there is a problem, and I have spoken in this place before about anti-dumping legislation. I am concerned that it is not quite as easy as it should be to protect some of our home industries that do suffer big injury from a dumped product. I urge the Anti-Dumping Authority and the Government to try to fix up some of these anomalies that are still there. I know the Authority and the Government are always looking for those anomalies because last time I spoke on this somebody from the Authority came to see me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Authority and the Government are moving some way to solve the problem, there is still a lot to be done. There are larger problems at large. Edgell-Birds Eye is closing factories in the Cowra area at the moment, which to some degree has been caused by the dumping of vegetables. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, welcome the annual report of the Anti-Dumping Authority. But I regret to say that the procedures under which the Anti-Dumping Authority is currently carrying out its work simply do not do justice to the current economic position of our industries. The Anti-Dumping Authority has as its task, to put it very plainly and bluntly, the protection of our industries against dumping from countries which seek to import products which are priced below the production costs in those countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I leave aside for the moment the extension that I would like to see, of what I call the exploitation index, which I believe should be used to assess products as dumped products if they are produced under unacceptably low working conditions, wages, environmental safeguards and so on in other countries. We should ensure that global standards are raised rather than that the hard-fought-for conditions in our industries are dragged down to the lowest common denominator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular I am concerned about the long delay that is still in place, despite the recent reductions and despite the reductions that the Government has foreshadowed, before an anti-dumping claim is concluded. This ties in with the onus of proof. Once an Australian company has shown that products are being dumped in our market below the level of the domestic prices being charged in the exporting country, then the onus of proof should revert to the importer rather than be at the door of the Australian producer or industry. This reversal of onus of proof is important if we are to protect our industries</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another aspect that is causing concern to a number of enterprises and industries, and that is the attitude of the officers who actually investigate these complaints. There seems to be a presumption that&mdash;and I use the unfortunate words of one public servant&mdash;`unless there is blood on the factory floor' they would not consider that injury has been done to the Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had representations from a Victorian firm, Caford Castors, which has found that, although it has gone to inordinate lengths to prove and show that competing products have been imported into Australia at prices below the domestic cost in the exporting country, it has still not received satisfaction or protection through a countervailing duty. It is a case that I have taken up with the office of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am looking forward to a review of this and other cases where Australian industries have suffered at the hands of public servants who, for some reason, seem to subscribe to the concept that the level playing field is doing us a lot of good. Whereas I believe that it is destroying our industries and is helping industries and employers in other countries to create jobs there rather than bring down the one million unemployed we have in our country here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are questions of principle which should be addressed by the Government. The Government should look at them again, despite the very recent inquiry into our anti-dumping procedure, which to my mind has not come down with recommendations that substantively and desirably alter the conditions under which the Authority should operate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Reference is made in the annual report of the Australian Institute of Criminology to a conference that took place in Canberra entitled `The sex industry and public policy conference'. I asked questions in the recent Estimates Committee about who paid for the visit of Professor Kutchinsky. The response has now come back and I use this opportunity to advise the Senate of the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Kutchinsky addressed that conference and his thesis was that the greater availability of pornography had not been accompanied by an increase in the frequency of rape or sexual offences. Frankly, that came as quite a surprise to most other people in the field, bearing in mind that many areas in Kutchinsky's previous papers had been quite seriously challenged by other academics. That included questioning his use of statistics. Indeed, the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Telecommunications Technologies has received a paper by Dr John H. Court and Dr Judith Reisman which critiques the speech made by Professor Kutchinsky at the sex industry and public policy conference and exposes its inadequacies. I have that paper in my hand and at the end of my speech I will seek leave to table it because I think it is important that it be tabled. The following is the abstract to that paper:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence advanced by Kutchinsky (1991), purporting to show a causal relationship between available pornography and the frequency of rape in four countries is critiqued. The causal argument is deemed fallacious, the evidence specious, and his interpretations fail to take account of the evidence in recent years which points to harm from exposure to pornographic materials. This resurrection of familiar themes notably ignores contrary evidence in order to provide a rationale for legitimizing pornography.</PARA>
<PARA>The Institute paid a total of $3,618 for Professor Kutchinsky's visit, but the worst part is that the Institute did not invite let alone pay for any of his well known critics in the international academic field to attend in order to give a balanced view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Institute has no doubt changed somewhat over the last few months since the departure of Dr Paul Wilson. If honourable senators study the Estimates Committee proceedings in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> relating to the Institute of Criminology over the last couple of years, they will see that Dr Wilson's responses in certain areas could well be regarded as odd.

<PARA>As I have often said in debates in this chamber on the wool industry&mdash;and it seems there have been a number of them in recent years&mdash;Australia has ridden on the sheep's back for years. The wool industry over time has provided much of our export earnings. Until the troubles of recent years&mdash;a period which is covered in this report&mdash;the industry had been Australia's greatest earner of export dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the annual report of the Australian Wool Corporation says, 1990-91 saw the end of an era in the history of the Australian wool industry, a year when the reserve price scheme, the foundation of a wool marketing scheme that served the industry well for 20 years, was abandoned. 1990-91 was one of the most difficult years in the history of the Australian wool industry. Depressed demand, due largely to the withdrawal of China and the USSR from the market, coupled with large wool supplies, put the reserve price scheme under increasing pressure. While the decision by the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Kerin, to lower the guaranteed minimum floor price to 700c in May 1990 was intended to stimulate demand, it failed to do so and speculation on the future of the reserve price scheme persisted. As the report notes on page 7:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AWC purchases reached record levels, accounting for 50-70% of weekly offerings, with stocks purchased through the scheme reaching 4.7 million bales by the end of January 1991. On 11 February, on the Board's reluctant recommendation, the Government suspended the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>The scheme operated successfully for all but the last 18 months of those years, providing price stability for both the growers and the wool textile industry. This in turn helped to position wool as a leading textile fibre, made wool growing a profitable farm enterprise and earned vital export income for this nation. The combination of adverse world economic and wool supply factors, the equal of which had never been seen before in the industry's history, put unprecedented pressure on the capacity of the scheme to cope. However, as the report notes on page 12:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it was the surrounding debate and continuing speculation about the sustainability of the scheme that ultimately killed it.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, the wool crisis was brought about by a series of events here in Australia, in our overseas markets, and in Government. It was in no way connected with the management and structure of the AWC, which had been carefully developed by commercial exports over many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report ends with the period when, under legislation introduced in June 1991, the Australian Wool Corporation was replaced by three bodies effective from 1 July 1991: the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, a new Australian Wool Corporation, and the Wool Research and Development Corporation. In introducing legislation on this issue, it was astonishing to read in the former Minister's second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is now a new era. The recriminations and disappointments of the past 18 months should remain in the past, and all efforts and energy should be devoted to building a revitalised and sustainable industry.</PARA>
<PARA>If ever there was a case of trying to dissociate oneself from some of the blame for what has happened, this is what the Minister was surely trying to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The origins of the wool crisis can be traced back to 1987 with the introduction of the Wool Marketing Bill when the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the Bill seeks to place the Australian Wool Corporation on a sound commercial footing so that it is equipped to respond now and into the future to the pressures of the market-place. Secondly, the Bill is designed to introduce appropriate arrangements to ensure that the Corporation is fully accountable to industry and government without disturbing its commercial performance.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that those words must come back to haunt the Minister because, no matter how hard he tried to achieve that, he failed dismally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, until recent years the industry managed to operate a market scheme, a reserve price scheme, very effectively. For 20 years the Australian wool industry benefited from unprecedented price stability. Yet the Government decided to intervene purely because it was unhappy that money was not going into the Treasury coffers quickly enough to cover Australia's enormous balance of payments difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have told the Senate in a number of debates on this issue, nowhere had it been demonstrated, as distinct from asserted, that, were the offer price for Australian wool to be lowered, there would be any kind of direct and significant demand response. Further, and more importantly, it had not been shown that any such response would ensure that gross income to the industry would increase or even be maintained. Interference by the Government would only ruin the reserve price scheme and ravage future orderly wool marketing. Yet in the previous year the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there is one central message I want to convey to you today, it is the commitment of the Australian industry and the Australian Government to stand behind the decision to lower the floor price and to work to overcome the problems that we confront.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, will comment on the Australian Wool Corporation report and some matters relating to the operations of the Australian Wool Corporation and the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. The situation for wool growers at this time is certainly looking much better than what it was at the same time last year. The market has responded in a stronger fashion than I think most people anticipated. The Opposition's calculations in terms of the wool industry at this time last year were absolutely accurate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the role of the Wool Corporation and the Wool Realisation Commission and their direction from here. I take this opportunity to acknowledge very strongly that the role that the Wool Realisation Commission and the Wool Corporation have played in terms of the amount of wool that has been sold has certainly exceeded most of our expectations and it has put the industry in a much stronger position. That leads to the fact that we can look at levying a much lower tax in terms of the operations and the requirement for the coming year. I suggest very strongly that we set the overall tax take, allowing for research and development of what is required to run the various aspects of the Corporation and the Wool Realisation Commission, as low as 6 per cent, and certainly no higher than 8 per cent of the total take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that the additional money that was extracted from growers last year, in terms of the requirement to run the various institutions, should be reflected in a lower tax so as to give wool growers the maximum opportunity to maximise their incomes and for many of them to get out of a deficit situation&mdash;at least to go close to breaking even&mdash;while we go through the next two or three years which will still be difficult but nonetheless better than most people have anticipated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise two points in particular with regard to the operations of the Wool Corporation, its structures and the annual general meeting on May 6. I hope the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) takes note of my comments on this because I think there is a serious anomaly in terms of the setting of the structures and how those annual general meetings are run. The situation which is of grave concern is the fact that under the voting system any motions that come forward from within the operations of those organisations require only a 33 per vote for acceptance. Yet any motions that come forward from the growers or the shareholders require a 66 per cent majority. I find that a serious anomaly in terms of the democratic process within an industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is responsible for the setting up of the industry. I think it requires a massive&mdash;and I would also suggest magnificent&mdash;input from the Opposition. But we have that anomaly that exists now and while it cannot be corrected this year it most certainly should be corrected for next year.

It absolutely amazes me that we have a situation through the methodology that was used that many wool growers who contributed this year will not be able to have a vote purely and simply because the method for notifying them was not satisfactory. The Wool Realisation Commission would have known quite simply all those people who sold wool this year by virtue of the collection of that levy. The growers should have been notified directly of that fact rather than in a magazine that some growers get or by notices in the paper. When it comes to the process of collecting funds or requiring the industry to do something, the organisations are quite capable of getting in touch with the growers. I find that a very serious anomaly&mdash;one that could interfere with the process that is required. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill seeks to ensure that there is a referendum before the flag is changed. As I understand it, that is the principal objective of the Bill. I concur with that. I think the Australian people, irrespective of what they feel about the flag, are entitled to have their views expressed in a proper constitutional manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and other people in the Government have been saying that the flag will not be changed until we have an indication of public support. I suppose questions could be raised whether that indication of public support should be a vote at a particular election, which will just tot up the number of people who have voted a certain way and the number of people who have voted another way. I do not think that that would be appropriate because, before the flag is changed, there must be a proposition; there has to be a new flag, and presumably that would be as a result of some sort of competition. But, if there is a competition, I assume that some sort of guidelines would be needed, which would be set to guide the people who were making the suggestions as to the change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those guidelines are either going to be set in the first instance by the Government or by the Parliament.

I think that is reasonable and logical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We, as elected representatives of the people, should have a say in what guidelines ought to be used for any such competition in the event of the Government deciding that there should be a competition for a new flag. I do not know whether the Government has decided yet whether there should be a new flag. But if the Government makes such a decision, then, in the first instance, the elected representatives of the people ought also to have a say in the guidelines for the competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The results of the competition, obviously, have to go before a panel. Who will comprise the panel? I think the persons who will comprise the panel ought to be appointed by this Parliament.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The referendum procedures should be followed because this is a vital issue in terms of image of this country. If a referendum can be held on such matters as simultaneous elections, why cannot this matter go to the people in a referendum context where a decision will be made by the majority of voters in the majority of States. That is the issue. I think that is the way in which this matter should be dealt with. But we are all getting ahead of ourselves. I do not think the issue of whether or not we should have a new flag is of tremendous importance at this stage.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we would have a competition and we would end up with three or four flag designs.

We could use it at sporting organisation dinners and at football matches. We could use it at events around Australia just to see what we thought of it. Finally, I think we would have to hold a referendum to see whether we would change it at all. We cannot just change the flag and expect everybody to like it. Senator Parer has the right idea: in the end I think we have to have a referendum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other parts of Senator Parer's Bill are very timely, too. The change to section 5 of the Australian National Flags Act 1953 is an important one; he is absolutely right about that. That section allows the Governor-General to permit more flags to be used in Australia than just the Australian blue ensign, as the national flag is now called. It would be possible for us to have a flag which we called the flag of the Australian Government which could be used on official occasions, and a flag of the Australian people which could be used on any occasion to represent Australia, without having a referendum or even changing the Flags Act. Senator Parer has done well in putting that in the Bill. </PARA>

That is a clear indication.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, who openly favour changing the flag and removing the Union Jack, believe it would be a grave mistake to introduce a new flag without a period of debate and consultation in the community.

We had those flags for 52 years of Federation and this myth that people opposite go on about, that every soldier who fought for Australia served under the blue ensign and some died under the blue ensign, is incorrect. In fact, most of them unfortunately died under other flags, the Union Jack and the red ensign. It should be put on the record. This mischief or myth that the blue ensign has been the only Australian flag since 1901 should be cleared up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned this before and I will keep mentioning it. The blue ensign, and its variation the red ensign, were adopted in 1901 after a competition to find a design for an Australian flag. I want to draw the attention of members opposite to the rules of that competition. Talk about a rigged set of rules! The rules said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The flag should be based on the British ensign, as the flags of the countries added to its folds, signalling to the beholder that it is an imperial union ensign of the British Empire.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think there is a more appropriate description of where the Liberal Party is today than back in the British Empire. John Howard said some six weeks ago that the Menzies period was the golden age in Australia and that we should all hanker back to it. Now those in the Liberal Party are saying, `Let us go back to the nineteenth century and the British Empire because that is the appropriate period'. At this rate, in another six months they will be asking to go back to the medieval age, because that was supposed to be the golden age. They are going backwards at an ever increasing rate. They will prove that the big bang theory was wrong and go back 15 billion years in history. People in Australia ought to be aware of what the rules were for the creation of the Australian flag. The flag had to show that we were part of the British Empire, an empire that no longer exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to the referendum itself. In his Bill Senator Parer calls it a `referendum' and Senator Bourne says that the Democrats support a referendum. Are the rules of the referendum going to be the same as the rules of a referendum that is needed to change the Constitution? That is, is it necessary to get a majority vote in a majority of the States to get a particular design adopted?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we had the plebiscite in 1977 instigated by Mr Fraser, several choices were available for the national anthem. It was a popular vote; it was not the vote of a referendum where there had to be an absolute majority in an absolute majority of States. There just had to be a vote to find out which anthem the simple majority of Australians liked. I ask Senator Bourne whether she favours the rules of a referendum to change the Constitution in such a referendum, where there has to be an absolute majority of the vote in an absolute majority of the States. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bourne used the word `referendum' and I want to make sure that we get it clear. For the sake of clarification, people in Australia should understand that we are not actually calling a referendum, because people understand a referendum in terms of changing the Constitution, which means that a particular result has to be achieved. A copy of the Bill has just been put in front of me and it says that it should be approved by a majority of all the electors voting.

That is a matter the honourable senator may care to comment on later. I suspect, as is usual and as it was in the national anthem competition, there may be an absolute majority but we may well get a third, a third and a third for three different designs, including perhaps the existing flag. I want to know exactly what the honourable senator means by `a majority'. I do not think we ought to get hung up on getting an absolute majority, particularly when there are a number of optional designs.

I understand a majority of Canadians, who were not consulted by way of a plebiscite or referendum, opposed removing the Union Jack, but within a year all Canadians welcomed and accepted the new Canadian flag, the maple leaf, as a symbol of their sovereignty and independence of their country and now fly it with great honour. </PARA>

I think that really does sum up the problem with the present flag. People mistake us for some other place; the flag does not have a distinctively Australian design. The Southern Cross is distinctive, but with the Union Jack perhaps we appear to be New Zealand, Hong Kong or, as the original description says, part of the British Empire. I believe it is more than time we have a flag that does not signify we are part of the British Empire but signifies that we are an independent country in our part of the world with our own distinctive symbol. </PARA>

A good cross-section of Australians should be asked to make up the judging panel. Its members should not be the usual suspects that the conservatives round up to run those sorts of things; it should be a cross-section.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank honourable senators for contributing to this debate. I make the point right from the outset that the coalition unequivocally and proudly supports our Australian flag. We do so because we see ourselves as Australians with no identity problems. The same obviously cannot be said about the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in particular and the members of the Australian Labor Party in general who do not seem to know who they are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite extraordinary that when the Prime Minister first raised this issue the general view was that he was letting loose a diversionary hare. Senator Harradine in his speech said he would give the Prime Minister the benefit of the doubt and believe that maybe he was serious. My belief is that he did let loose a hare to take away the attention of his fellow Australians from the economic disaster he has imposed upon this country&mdash;record unemployment with no light at the end of the tunnel; record bankruptcies; jobs destroyed, and no potential for restoring those jobs. So he let loose the hare. But he got caught up in it and he had no option but to continue. Going down the diversionary tactic, as an historian like Senator Schacht would know, is as old as history itself. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact is that the issue was raised by the Prime Minister; Senator Harradine said that. In fact, we did nothing for a couple of days until we saw that the Prime Minister was hell-bent on going down this route. Hence, we responded, as is right and proper. We were responding on behalf of the vast majority of Australians&mdash;loyal, nationalistic Australians&mdash;who want to see our flag protected. Before I was interrupted by Senator Schacht I was saying that this diversionary tactic is as old as history. It was a tactic used in the Roman days. When things were bad economically back in those days they would run a show at the Colosseum and throw a few Christians to the lions to divert the attention of the people away from the economic conditions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very disconcerting&mdash;this again supports the views expressed by Senator Harradine&mdash;that the Prime Minister, instead of directing his energy and attention to the disastrous economy, has seen fit to run the flag issue. As I indicated earlier, as the Prime Minister has done so we must respond. Whether Senator Schacht likes it or not, the Opposition represents the view of the majority of Australians who are pretty proud of the flag that we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will outline a little bit of history. Senator Schacht makes great play of the fact that the flag only became our flag in 1953. Nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>

One of the successful entrants in the competition was a 14-year-old schoolboy named Ivor Evans. His family still makes the flags today. I think it is great that that sort of tradition continues in this country. In fact, Ivor's father was a flag maker back in the 1890s or thereabouts. In today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> there is an article about Ivor Evans's son. Ivor is now about 67 years of age. His son said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's a bloody good flag, it's a beautiful flag.</PARA>
<PARA>What is the flag and what does it represent? I think we have to spell this out. The Prime Minister started this debate. Senator Schacht and everyone else is saying, `Let's have the debate'. I am very happy to say, `Let's commence the debate'. What is our flag? We had the competition and 30,000-odd entries were received. It came down to a list of a few and a judgment was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht indicated that there was some criteria about the Union Jack. I say to him quite honestly that there is a grey area with respect to that. The gazette that went out did not mention any criteria at all. I suspect&mdash;we have been trying to do some research on this&mdash;that because of the number of entries the six or seven judges, from a broad range of Australian people, started to set their own rules as to how they would limit the judgment of 30,000-odd entries down to four or five. I think four successful people shared the prize because they had identical entries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the flag? We all know that it is a symbol. Some Labor parliamentarians have said in years gone by that it is a tatty bit of cloth&mdash;and so it might be. To refer to it like that is the same as referring to the Taj Mahal as dirt, sand and cement&mdash;and so it is. The flag is a symbol and a symbol of our country. I think it is a great symbol. It has the Southern Cross on it. The Southern Cross is neither unique to Australia nor to our flag: there are a lot of countries with the Southern Cross on their flag. For example, Papua New Guinea has the Southern Cross on its flag. It represents something important to Australia; it represents our timeless land. Senator Schacht talked about the big bang. That is when the Southern Cross appeared. If he is suggesting that we should not retain the Southern Cross because it was formed at the time of the big bang in the universe, let us get rid of that too. It is utterly illogical. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the Union Jack. It is symbolic of our past. No-one denies that we went through a colonial phase. In 1901 we received independence. It was decided to include the Union Jack on the flag. The Union Jack is simply a symbolic representative of the crosses of Saint Patrick, Saint George and Saint Andrew, who are the patron saints of Ireland, England and Scotland. Some people may say: does this not represent some sort of a hang-up with colonialism? Of course it does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should bear in mind that from that part of our history we have got our language. Will we hear next from the Prime Minister that he thinks, because of our long connections with Britain, that we should get a new language? Will he suggest some sort of a blend&mdash;Esperanto? To be consistent, if we are embarrassed about our background, our history, we should change our language. The Union Jack also represents the democracy we have in Australia, the Westminster system and all of our laws. The three-cross position is symbolic of our total Christian traditions which we continue to have in this country. It is reflected in the fact that every time this Parliament sits the Lord's Prayer is recited. We have the seven-pointed star which represents the six States and the colonies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had Federation in 1901. No-one that I know&mdash;except perhaps the Prime Minister&mdash;would argue that we have not been independent or recognised as such since 1901. That was the view and the spirit. We hear about the Anzac spirit. Many people who were involved in the Anzacs and Gallipoli would not have been born in this country, but they saw themselves as Australian. My 86 year old mother-in-law was born in Scotland, but every chance she gets she says, `I'm an Aussie'. She does not see herself as being a Scot; she sees herself as being an Australian. What came out of Federation and the flag was the slogan&mdash;everyone should know the slogan from 1901&mdash;`One people, one destiny, one flag'. Our flag stands for that tradition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday I heard Senator Collins say in this place that he was Irish. I then checked my own origins. Going back well over 100 years, the population of this country was 75 per cent Irish and 25 per cent Spanish. I am neither of those nationalities; I am an Australian and a very nationalistic one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who came to our great country and who continue to do so have done so for a number of reasons. I am going right back in time. Of course, no-one denies that the Aboriginals came here about 40,000 years ago. There is no doubt that they migrated south when the countries of the world were joined together. People came here for various reasons: some by force as convicts; they were hounded out of their own countries by oppressive governments; or they wanted a better way of life for their families. Much of that latter group came after the Second World War when they saw Europe devastated. They would have said, `We really do not want our children to go through what we have gone through over the past six or seven years'. When these migrants came and stayed they became Australians, represented in the country by our flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have this newfound phoney nationalism by the Prime Minister. All of us were ashamed&mdash;even Senator Bolkus would have been ashamed&mdash;by the comments of the Prime Minister in Indonesia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have this incredible view of what occurred in Indonesia. We would have said, `Look, we are over here to make friends and promote trade'. The Indonesians would have said, `Great, what are you going to offer?'. We would have said, `We are going to change the flag'. Imagine the reaction!

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What would be our reaction if some people came to Australia from a neighbouring country, said they had a disaster of an economy because of the actions of the person speaking to them, and then said, `Look, we really want to come over, let bygones be bygones and sort out our problems. There are a few things we would like to suggest to you'. We would ask, `What are they?'. If they then said, `We are going to change our flag', we would say, `Big deal, if you want to go that route. That has nothing to do with us; that is an internal problem'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, as someone who had a lot of bad experiences from the effects of the Second World War&mdash;I was born in Papua New Guinea&mdash;I found the comments of the Prime Minister there appalling. The Prime Minister discovered some new names&mdash;he obviously did not learn them at school&mdash;with places such as Milne Bay and Kokoda. In fact, the great history of the war has become a legend in Australia because of the actions of my uncle who filmed the Kokoda Trail. It is a little ironic that Damien Parer made famous the people of Kokoda, the fuzzy wuzzy angels and battles such as the battle of the Bismarck Sea. I could go on and on. Damien Parer was killed in action by the Japanese whilst filming Americans fighting in Peleliu Island. Why was he there? He was there because the Australian Labor Government of the day was not interested in the work he had done. That is not generally public knowledge, but I am telling honourable senators this because I know it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interviews were held with the then Minister for Information, Mr Calwell. He showed no interest whatsoever in Damien's work in Kokoda and other places. It is a very sad situation. All I know is that Damien was an extraordinarily nationalistic person. Even though he switched to Paramount, because it gave him proper equipment to use on the filming of the Kokoda Trail, he insisted on wearing his Australian uniform. He was killed while wearing his Australian uniform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we are introducing the Flags Amendment Bill to amend the Flags Act so that there will be no change to the Australian flag without a referendum.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A: I think for the moment not much.</PARA>
<PARA>These are hardly answers to questions that support the position put by the Minister to this chamber today. Let us look at what happened on 20 May 1991. Mr Willis said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the IRC's role was not entirely clear at present but the Government would wait and see how it treated the next round of agreements before it.</PARA>

<PARA>These statements from the Prime Minister and Mr Willis, the Minister representing Senator Cook, make it quite clear that after the national wage case in April 1991 the Government was on a road to undermining the role and the position of the Industrial Relations Commission. It is not correct to stand up here today and pretend otherwise. In fact, Mr Willis's answer of `Do as we want or do what we put before you, otherwise you're on the way out', would suggest typical bully tactics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion before the Senate stems directly from what we have known for a long period&mdash;that is, most of the commissioners of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission have lost confidence in the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Peter Cook, to allow the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to carry out its function with independence and integrity. This was brought to a head by the extraordinary letter of resignation by Commissioner Turbet dated 14 April 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This dissatisfaction runs from the high office of the President of the Commission, Mr Justice Maddern, through to almost every commissioner who serves on the bench. The possible only exceptions&mdash;and the Minister would not answer a question about this today&mdash;are those recent Government-cum-ACTU-cum-Bill Kelty appointments. An article about the annual report of the Industrial Relations Commission says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Federal Government-sponsored inquiry into the pay and structure of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission would be seen as further damaging the integrity and independence of the Commission, according to its president, Justice Barry Maddern.</PARA>
<PARA>There is interference in two main areas: firstly, government interference in the decisions of the Remuneration Tribunal; and, secondly, government interference in the national wage case brought down in April 1991, and that has continued. I will deal with the second one first. The April 1991 national wage case decision is significant. Commissioner Turbet, in his statement, as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 25 and 26 April, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process of the Accord is now no more than a meeting between the Prime Minister and the Secretary of the ACTU. Everybody else, the whole of the trade union movement and this commission, is expected to toe the line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the April 1991 decision, the ACTU held a special unions conference at which a document was circulated outlining all of the terrible things that were going to happen if this decision was implemented.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In purely economic terms, in the facts, it is difficult to say that the Accord process in its later manifestations has produced results which really benefit the Australian workforce.</PARA>
<PARA>This statement&mdash;delivered by a man who was a former national secretary of the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association, a former ALP member and a Labor candidate in the 1969 election&mdash;highlights quite clearly that the Government, through the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industrial Relations, undermined the independence and integrity of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have been saying on this side of the chamber for a long time is that the accord is a failure. The accord has not produced lifts in the productivity that this country requires. It has not protected employees who are in a weak position. It has contributed significantly to the level of unemployment that now exists in this country and the record levels of bankruptcies. Let us always remember that it did not protect those people who are now on the dole. As I said, it is one of the significant contributors to the level of unemployment we have today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the accord encourages the worst work practices imaginable and cannot give any reward for those who are prepared to do a bit extra or work harder. It has failed this country miserably. Until such time as it is abolished and true workplace enterprise agreements are introduced, where employers and employees can make their own work place agreements without interference from government or the unions, or anybody else for that matter, we will see little or no improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commissioner Turbet went on to say this about the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He didn't stand up for the Commission following the April 1991 national wage case decision. In fact, Senator Cook issued his guidelines for enterprise bargaining, which, on the face of them, were written by a junior clerk in his office. They were an absolute sham and had been completely disregarded by the Australian industrial community.</PARA>
<PARA>Then he delivered his greatest indictment of the Minister when he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People say that Senator Cook is the Minister assisting the Secretary of the ACTU. It's really a bad show when public comments like that are made.</PARA>
<PARA>This is no different from what I have said in this place previously&mdash;that he is no more than the Minister acting for the BWIU. We will be debating this issue when the contractors' amendments come before this place in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to deal with some aspects of Commissioner Turbet's letter. The first point I wish to deal with is the matter relating to the Remuneration Tribunal. His letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the Government cannot be relied upon to keep its word. A classic and simple example is your about face on the Gleeson Committee's recommendation in regard to recognition of the Remuneration Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gleeson recommended:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Government should only seek to disallow remuneration determination of the Tribunal if extraordinary circumstances arise.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The need to maintain the independence of the Remuneration  Tribunal is recognised and the Government accepts that it should only seek to disallow determinations in exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, the first determination you receive from the Remuneration Tribunal concerning the AIRC following this announcement of policy you reject. There are no "extraordinary or exceptional circumstances" surrounding the reasoning supporting the decision. The word of the Government in the form of the official policy statement just wasn't worth the paper it was written on.</PARA>
<PARA>This highlights quite clearly once again the interference by this Government in its Australian Industrial Relations Commission, which it calls the umpire&mdash;but only the umpire if it puts its finger up when the Government wants it to do so. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I wish to deal with the points relating to the Constitution. Once again, I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, my third and most compelling reason for resigning is your Government's total lack of understanding of and respect for the Constitutional requirements of Section 51(xxxv) of the Constitution. There have been five referenda directed at altering this provision. All have failed. The Industrial Relations power is therefore in the same terms as when originally drafted in 1900. The AIRC has been established under s.51(xxxv) and its jurisdiction and power is limited by the Section as interpreted by the High Court. For my part I have been directly involved in two cases which have contributed to a significant expansion of the Commonwealth's power in this area. I refer to Turbet's case (144 CLR 335) and the Social Welfare case (153 CLR 299) where I was a member of the Full Bench whose decision went to the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA>This once again highlights the fact that when it suits them, this Government, and this Minister in particular, move outside the law and try to do their own thing. They only have respect for it when it suits them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My third point relates to statements, which I have already quoted, by the then Treasurer and now Prime Minister. Once again, I quote from the letter:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Statements by the then Treasurer, now the current Prime Minister, that the April 1991 National Wage decision was made by just "five officials" and that "the Accord is the primary national income determining institution, not the Commission" reveal either a complete lack of understanding of the Nation's Constitution or a deliberate endeavour to administer the Nation's affairs in a manner inconsistent with its provisions.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to make the point that this highlights quite clearly that, while this Government has said that the Commission has a role to play and that that role has not been changed, the Government has changed very significantly and undermined that role. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the suspension of the sitting I had just finished quoting from the letter from Commissioner Turbet on the position of the Prime Minister in relation to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Further to this unquestionable lack of confidence that the Government has created in the Commission by its lack of support for the institution&mdash;the Government's umpire&mdash;I make the following point: this is not a debate about the coalition's position and the coalition's role for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission; it is about the constant undermining of the Commission by Senator Cook on behalf of the ACTU. That is why he is now known as the Minister representing the Secretary of the ACTU.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the following points: first, the Government had a national wage case in April 1991 which the Government, on behalf of the ACTU, rejected; secondly, the Government's industrial relations policy is in total disarray because of its inconsistencies&mdash;a wishy-washy industrial relations statement was brought down in October of last year; and, thirdly, in October 1991 a national wage case decision was handed down when the principles of enterprise bargaining were established. The Government then released the statement contained in the One Nation package. There are significant contradictions in the positions that the Government has adopted between each of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government accepts the Commission's decisions only if it suits Mr Keating and Mr Kelty. Is it the Government's intention to make a further major statement on industrial relations at the end of June? Does Senator Cook intend to change the name of the Department of Industrial Relations? Will it be known as the Department to Satisfy Bill Kelty? Is it not a fact that the Department recommended that the head of the Construction Industry Reform Agency should be paid approximately $90,000 and that the Minister overrode this recommendation and has appointed a person who will be paid approximately $160,000?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only has the Australian Industrial Relations Commission lost confidence in the Minister but also have many of his staff in his Department because of his high-handed approach. In this case, with regard to the salary setting, I suspect that the Minister's staff have lost confidence in him because he is serving the BWIU and ignoring their recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a serious matter. Moving a motion calling for the resignation of a Minister is a serious matter. But the time has come for Senator Cook to consider his position. Most of the members of the Arbitration Commission, including the President, whom I quoted, have lost faith in him. The Minister has undermined the institution that he claims he stands up for and calls the `umpire'. His problem is that he will only accept the decision of that umpire when it suits him. His problem is that he cannot do the job without being overruled and instructed by the Secretary of the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has forgotten that in any industrial policy there are two sides to the equation&mdash;the processes of establishing the accord and the operations of the Government with regard to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The Minister has forgotten one side of the equation, and that is the employers. He has tried to foist on them, amongst other things, massive increases in occupational superannuation which will just lead to further unemployment and further increases in bankruptcies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister's subservience to the BWIU is now legendary. His determination through the introduction of the contractors' amendments proved that he is out to destroy Troubleshooters. He has no respect for Justice Woodward of the Federal Court, the Full Bench of the Federal Court or the High Court which all upheld the Troubleshooters' case. He has consistently denigrated companies such as Robe River for their use of the courts of the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He says constantly that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is the umpire. Yet when Bill Kelty tells him to oppose the decisions of the Commission, such as the April 1991 wage case, he attacks the Commission publicly and undermines his umpire&mdash;not our umpire, but his umpire. He has destroyed the independence and credibility of the Commission. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has done this by stealth. His words of support for the AIRC do not match the Government's action or his own. The Minister no longer represents fairly the full spectrum of industrial relations in this country. Therefore, he should resign. </PARA>

Presumably, if Senator Cook was part of the alleged deals that are taking place&mdash;which are certainly not taking place&mdash;he would be a strong Minister and the Opposition would be congratulating him. It just highlights the absurd wording of the motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend to deal with a number of issues in this debate, in particular the accusations by former Commissioner Turbet that have been seized upon by those opposite, not in a particularly inspiring and dramatic way as evidenced by the speech that has just occurred, but in order to continue a campaign of denigration and undermining of the Arbitration Commission by the Liberal and National parties. I will draw the attention of the Senate to that continued campaign of denigration by those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal with some of the charges and comments made by Commissioner Turbet. I will then look at some of the considerable array of alleged misconduct by Senator Cook that ranges from accusations and assertions by Senator Crane: that he has allegedly lost the confidence of most of the commissioners of the Industrial Relations Commission; that Senator Cook does not accept decisions of the Commission; that he intends to change the name of his Department&mdash;big deal; that he is foisting on the country and employers a heavier burden with superannuation payments; that he intends to wipe out, through the contractors amendments legislation, companies such as Troubleshooters; and that he continues to denigrate Robe River. A considerable array of charges have been put forward and I will make some comments on those a little later. If I have time, I will then go into the real reasons for the Liberal-National parties' attack on the Industrial Commission and on Senator Cook and why, as a consequence, Senator Cook should certainly not resign but should be congratulated by this Senate for his excellent performance as Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I will deal with Commissioner Turbet who resigned last week and made a series of claims in his resignation letter. I will deal with a number of the comments that Commissioner Turbet made that were not really in any way significantly alluded to by Senator Crane, and yet they seem to form the basis of the motion that he has put before the Senate tonight. However, there was very little reference to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the accusations made by Commissioner Turbet is that he claimed that the Government's decision to reject the Remuneration Tribunal determination concerning the Australian Industrial Relations Commission shows that its word cannot be trusted. I certainly refute that accusation. The Government has not gone back on its word. With respect to the Remuneration Tribunal, the Gleeson Committee&mdash;as it was known&mdash;recommended that the Government seek only to disallow Remuneration Tribunal determinations in exceptional circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Gleeson review that was carried out was a full and open inquiry into the restructuring of the Commission. It was broadly representative and its findings were unanimous. The restructuring of the Commission and the creation of the positions of vice-president and senior deputy president were endorsed by the Government and agreed upon by this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Remuneration Tribunal failed to fulfil its responsibility to determine the rates of pay for all the Commission positions as requested by the Government. This, therefore, was the exceptional circumstance which has been a substantial influence on the Government's decision to present legislation to the Parliament to change the Tribunal's determination. So it is not a matter, as Commissioner Turbet has charged, of an attack on the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an allegation that there has been disenchantment within the Industrial Relations Commission and that there have been resignations. In fact, two members have resigned, Mr Justice Peterson and Commissioner Turbet. Mr Justice Peterson resigned on 28 April to take up a position with the New South Wales Industrial Commission and the New South Wales Industrial Court. He had been a member of the Commission since 1987. He has not indicated in any direct way that he decided to resign over the so-called pay issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commissioner Turbet submitted his letter last week, on 14 April. He joined the Commission in 1978 and he has decided, for his own stated reasons, to retire early. Commissioner Turbet did not approach the Government to put his views or to seek an explanation of the Government's position before acting. He did not seek to take up any of the particular concerns. No matter how much we on the Government side rejected his concerns, he did not seek to take them up with the Government. I do not believe Commissioner Turbet's actions can be taken in good faith in that regard. If Commissioner Turbet chooses to resign, that is a matter for him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an allegation that there has been a continuing deterioration in the Government's relationship with the Commission. As Senator Cook indicated today in Question Time, he has taken the initiative and on 8 April wrote to the President of the Commission expressing his willingness to meet with members of the Commission to discuss any matters of concern. I understand that to date Commission members have not met with Senator Cook, if indeed they have any concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The further charge is the potential bias in the appointment of new members of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. In examining the allegation of bias, which has been taken up certainly by Mr John Howard with a fair amount of gusto, let us have a look at the cross-section of membership of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Certainly Commissioner Turbet has ignored the very clear evidence that there is a broad and fair cross-section of the industrial relations community on the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 13 deputy presidents appointed since the election of this Government in March 1983, five have union backgrounds; five practised as industrial lawyers; one was a former politician, and one a leading academic. That is hardly domination from the industrial union movement. Three of the five union persons have worked with the ACTU. One of the lawyers, Justice Peterson, has just resigned. So the Government has sought to maintain a balance on the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the background of the current Commissioners, of whom there are 30. Of those, 13 are from a union background; 12 are from employer backgrounds; five are from government; and there are no legal or academic representatives. So again the balance is roughly equal. We certainly cannot claim that there has been any domination by union representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only complaint I would make about the representation on the Commission is that there is no-one from Tasmania. I think that is an appalling state of affairs. If one wants to criticise the background of the Commissioners, the only criticism I would seek to make is that it is unfortunate that they are from Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, three from Brisbane and one from Perth. It is about time we had someone from Tasmania on the Commission, but that is certainly the only criticism that could legitimately be made. They are the sorts of comments that Commissioner Turbet raises in his correspondence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that I should like to deal with tonight is the reaction of the Opposition, particularly that of Mr John Howard, to this letter of resignation. Mr John Howard made an outrageous statement. Let me quote his comments, which really get down to the real reasons why the Liberal-National parties are continuing to denigrate and attack the role of the Industrial Relations Commission. Mr Howard said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberal and National parties will not guarantee the security of tenure of future appointments by the Keating Government to the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is not an attack on the independence of the Industrial Relations Commission, I do not know what is. It must rival the statement by the Victorian Leader of the Opposition, Jeff Kennett, that he would retrospectively take away the superannuation entitlements of Labor politicians who did not resign. Mr Howard's statement rivals that sort of crass and quiet undemocratic attack on government institutions in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the particular charge outlined by Senator Crane that most of the Commissioners have lost confidence in the Minister, Senator Peter Cook, where is the evidence? We have one letter of resignation&mdash;one only. There is no evidence to suggest any significant discontent by the Commission with Senator Cook. So it is purely an assertion that is being made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the evidence that Senator Cook does not accept the decisions? On occasions Senator Cook has stated publicly his concern as to a number of decisions by the Industrial Relations Commission. But overwhelmingly Senator Cook has accepted the decisions of the Commission, as indeed have the ACTU and the employer movement. In fact, Senator Cook and the trade union movement in this country have done nothing more than the employers occasionally do, which is to complain about a decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my experience in the industrial relations arena, quite frequently employers and unions do complain publicly about the outcome of a decision, and not infrequently governments complain about a particular decision. But the important thing in this democratic country with an independent industrial commission is that we accept the outcomes. There is no evidence to suggest that Senator Cook in any way has attempted to undermine or reverse any sort of industrial relations decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an absurd charge from Senator Crane that Senator Cook wants to change the name of the Department. As I have already said, what a big deal. We have a charge that he wants to foist increases on superannuation. That is a separate issue. The issue of superannuation benefits for Australian workers will be debated. I am chairing the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation which is looking at that legislation and those issues. That issue will be debated in this forum on another occasion. That is an attempt to ensure that the working community in this country receives a fair, just and reasonable retirement income through improved superannuation benefits as a result not of legislation coming from Senator Cook's Department but from Treasury. It is ridiculous to make that sort of absurd accusation as the basis for Senator Cook to resign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those Opposition senators have concerns, I suggest they wait to see the legislation relating to contractors legislation before they start asserting that it shows Senator Cook's subservience to the union movement in the industrial relations community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a further charge that Senator Cook has denigrated Robe River. Well, good on Senator Cook for denigrating Robe River. He has quite correctly criticised the appalling industrial relations processes there. The Peko company at Robe River set out to intimidate individual workers, to strip away their wages and conditions, to sack them, and to use its enormous financial clout in the industrial and legal courts to thwart any fair play and justice by the workers concerned or their trade union representatives. So good on Senator Cook for fairly and legitimately criticising Robe River. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can recall Senator Cook on occasions criticising the trade union movement. I can recall statements made by Senator Cook criticising the Builders Labourers Federation. But no mention was made of those occurrences this evening by Senator Crane. If we examine the balance of Senator Cook's record, the charges being made tonight are absurd and ridiculous, and they should be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now reveal the real reason for this weak and pathetically moved and debated resolution. If those opposite want to launch a full scale urgency debate, I suggest the time for that was earlier today. The real reason is presented in the article on the front page of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review. </EMPHASIS> It discloses the real Hewson-Howard agenda&mdash;the big bang theory. The big bang theory is that industrial awards are done away with overnight; workers without union representation will have no award protection and will not be able to go to an independent industrial commission; they must individually front up to the employers and attempt to bargain for a fair set of wages and conditions. That is what has happened in New Zealand where Dr Hewson was last week along with many others opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New Zealand there has been a quite appalling compression and reduction in conditions and wages. The notion that an individual employee can bargain equally with an individual employer is absolute nonsense.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook ably outlined the gross misrepresentations, if not lies, made by Dr Hewson when he alleged that there had been a 6 per cent improvement in productivity in New Zealand as a result of industrial relations changes whilst there was a decline in productivity here. Senator Cook's explanation showed that that was absolutely untrue and exposed the practice of grossly manipulating figures to suit the particular ideological bent of those opposite. Dr Hewson did not think he would get caught out on it, but of course he was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continuing campaign of denigration and criticism of the Commission by those opposite is so that, if they ever do get into office&mdash;I do not think they will&mdash;they can remove the Australian Industrial Relations Commission from the industrial scene. The Industrial Relations Commission serves a very important function. It acts as an independent umpire to fairly determine wages and conditions, particularly for those who are not in a strong industrial bargaining position. If those opposite want to do away with the Industrial Relations Commission, if they want to remove commissioners retrospectively, if that is the sort of approach they are going to take, they should be open and honest about it to the Australian community. That is the real reason the Liberal-National parties are concerned about Commissioner Turbet's letter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal-National parties have raised the issue that Commissioner Turbet was a former union official and a former Labor candidate. Big deal! So what! Every Commissioner before whom I have appeared in the Federal or State jurisdiction, irrespective of their background&mdash;whether they were employer or union representatives&mdash;has behaved very fairly and very justly. I cannot think of a single example out of the hundreds of appearances I have made before Federal and State commissions where an employer commissioner behaved unfairly in a case. That is a hallmark of the commissioners that we have in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Commissioners with union backgrounds tend to be a little harder on their former colleagues, the union movement, when making decisions because they want to show that they are independent and not currying favour. As regards the current membership of the Commission and any persons who are appointed or who may be appointed in the next few months, I am quite confident that the strong tradition of independence and impartiality will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a hotch-potch of accusations and assertions. We have a letter from Commissioner Turbet making allegations. I will not speculate about the reasons for his resignation, but he has made a series of allegations which do not stand up to factual analysis. Therefore, we have a series of charges which are not proved, and the onus is on the Liberal and National parties to prove the litany of assertions they have made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by summarising those assertions. There is the reference to Commissioner Turbet's letter&mdash;which I think I have rebutted&mdash;and the criticisms he made therein. That was one letter from one commissioner who has resigned. There is no evidence to support the charge made by Senator Crane that most of the commissioners have lost confidence in the Minister. Where is the evidence? There is no evidence that Senator Cook does not accept decisions. He has only very occasionally criticised decisions, but that is no more than any government&mdash;State or Federal, Labor or Liberal&mdash;has done in the past 10 or 20 years. That he will change the name of his Department is a fairly absurd allegation of poor behaviour by Senator Cook. I will enter into the debate another time on the allegation that he is foisting superannuation on the Australian community, but I think it is appropriate that this Government is attempting to ensure a fair and just retirement for the Australian work force. </PARA>

The charges made are not proved. They are assertions and nothing more. It is simply a cover-up by those opposite in an attempt to continue their campaign to introduce individual employment contracts a la New Zealand. It is part of their campaign to continue to remove the various industrial wages and conditions that workers in this country have come to regard as being fair. It is a continuing part of that campaign. This Government will take it up to them over this next year and, as in so many other areas, we will beat them at the next election on issues such as this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my colleague Senator Crane in the moving of his motion calling on Senator Cook to resign for four very specific reasons that are set out in his motion. I think the bare bones of the case that has been made out by Senator Crane are contained in the exchange of letters between Commissioner Turbet and `Senator the Honourable'&mdash;and I question in this context the `Honourable'&mdash;`Peter Cook'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former Commissioner Turbet sets out in his letter the salient points for his resignation. He sets them out in the context of describing himself as having been a Commission member for 14 years, which was preceded by 16 years service in the trade union movement and 20 years membership of the Australian Labor Party. In that context, he sets out to show how the Government has undermined the integrity and independence of the Industrial Relations Commission. Indeed, it is an irony that the Government, which purports to say that it can sustain a centralised wage fixing system because it somehow has an independent arbiter in the IRC, by its own actions has torpedoed any reputation, or any belief that anyone would have, that the Commission remains independent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Setting out the facts as they are in his letter of 14 April, former Commissioner Turbet makes some very salient points. His first reason for resigning is that the Government cannot be relied upon to keep its word. </PARA>

It is more important and becomes more important that the wider community also becomes aware of it. Here is testimony from a man who comes from within that Labor Party movement and who says finally, `Enough is enough'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He gives the example of why the Government's word cannot be trusted. He deals with the Government's about-face on the Gleeson Committee's recommendation with regard to the recognition of the Remuneration Tribunal. Anybody who comes from New South Wales knows very well the strength and connections with the Labor Party that Gerry Gleeson has. The long-serving head of Premier Wran's department, a figure who was noted as having much power, could never be described as being unsympathetic to the Labor Party or its movement. Yet, that Gleeson report recommended <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government should only seek to disallow a remuneration determination of the Tribunal if extraordinary circumstances arise.</PARA>
<PARA>The Cabinet's response was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need to maintain the independence of the Remuneration Tribunal is recognised and the Government accepts that it should only seek to disallow determinations in exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Former Commissioner Turbet goes on to say that the first determination that was received from the Remuneration Tribunal following that acceptance of the recommendation was an announcement of the policy that was rejected. Former Commissioner Turbet quite simply says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no "extraordinary or exceptional circumstances" surrounding the Remuneration Tribunal's decision. There are, in fact, 15 pages of detailed reasoning supporting the decision. The word of the Government in the form of an official policy statement just wasn't worth the paper it was written on.</PARA>
<PARA>What response did we get from Senator Cook&mdash;`Senator the Honourable Peter Cook', as he is addressed in Mr Turbet's letter? Senator Cook says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Remuneration Tribunal failed to fulfil its responsibility to determine rates of pay for all Commission positions as requested by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the acid test: `as requested by the Government'. What a nice euphemism&mdash;`as requested by the Government'. As intervened by the Government, as intermeddling by the Government, as being dictatorial by the Government, caving into the demands of Mr Kelty. In other words, the Government directed that the Tribunal should break the nexus between judges and the Commission. Therefore, former Commissioner Turbet is quite right when he says that he did not as, so-called, requested by the Government carry out that direction. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The public's perception of the independence and integrity of the Commission is the appointment process. The Commission should represent a fair cross-section of the Australian community. It is essential that the presidential level contains good lawyers together with persons qualified in economics, and those with acknowledged industrial relations skills and experience. Over recent times the top lawyers have retired, among them two QC's. They have not been replaced. Is it that the standing of the Commission has fallen so low that the "silks" who regularly appear before us would never accept an appointment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also damages the institution. . . when the names of prospective appointees are being speculated upon in the press and in industry journals. If the appointment comes to pass they are perceived to be stooges for the side of industry from which they come. If not, they stand humiliated in the eyes of their peers.</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite interesting, I think, that it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, the press and self-styled informed newsletters are touting Jenny Acton from the ACTU staff as a Deputy President. One newspaper article headcounted the Presidential members noting that Ms Acton will make it four directly out of the ACTU office, plus another two who were members of the ACTU Executive. It cannot be denied that four Deputy Presidents from the ACTU office is hardly a fair cross-section of the Australian industrial community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I as Chair of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs tabled this report on employment of people with disabilities  during the last sitting week we were under severe time constraints, as we often are in this place, and I confined myself to the tabling statement. I now wish to add briefly to that statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report had a very long gestation. We were given the reference in August 1988, which is more than three years ago and a lengthy period for a Standing Committee inquiry. However, those three years were not continuous. After we had held a number of hearings and visited a number of relevant work places, in mid-1989 we were given a reference with a limited timeframe to inquire into accommodation for people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the time we were able to report on that reference&mdash;in the meantime having been delayed by the pilots' dispute which inhibited our travel and by the dissolution of Parliament in March 1990&mdash;it was May 1990. After that election there were some changes in the membership of the Committee and we lost some valuable expertise. We also had a number of staff changes in the secretariat which meant a sharp learning curve was needed for some Committee members and some of our support staff. A further delay resulted from the institution of the Bills to committee procedures, because this Committee is one which has had a number of references on Bills, some of which required a great deal of committee time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime we have also received two further references in the area of health. Yesterday we reported on radiological services in relation to the Medicare benefit schedule and next week we are due to report on pharmaceutical restructuring. Thus we apologise to all those out in the community with a vital interest in the employment of people with disabilities for the delay in presenting the report, but we believe we have produced a thorough and useful appraisal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the present Committee, and also the previous Committee, have been associated in some way over a number of years with support work in the area of disability. Therefore, we brought a lot of our own experience, and in some cases professional expertise, to our work on this inquiry. We carried out many visits to the workplaces of people with disabilities. These were particularly valuable because we were able to check with our own eyes and ears what we had heard and read in evidence and they enabled us to talk informally with workers with disabilities and others who work with them. This was a very useful experience. For example, on one occasion we saw very unsafe work practices which alerted us to the need to pay more regard to industrial health and safety issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank all those who gave evidence and enabled us to make visits to workplaces. For my own part, I would like to thank service providers and others in Darwin, whom I visited as Chair on behalf of the Committee, and government officials in several parts of Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom who not only gave me information on their own provisions in this policy area but also discussed with me very openly the minuses as well as the pluses in their experience of service provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the numerous staff who assisted us in our work and the former members of the Committee who I hope will read our report with approval. Finally, I pay tribute to the work of Don Grimes, the former Minister for Community Services, who was responsible for the passage of the Disability Services Act and the work which preceded it. It was landmark legislation which is looked up to in other countries as well. In his second reading speech on that Bill, Don Grimes said that it represented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the culmination of sustained effort by a broad cross-section of those many people, both within and outside government, concerned for the future of people with disabilities and of the families who have a person with a disability.</PARA>
<PARA>I support those words and add that in the intervening years their contributions have continued, linked with the efforts of people with disabilities themselves, to enable as many people with disabilities as possible to be able to participate as fully as possible in the community, in employment as well as in other ways. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The inquiry into mergers, monopolies and acquisitions was initiated by a Democrat motion on 16 May 1991. This followed a series of amendments which were moved. We felt that the current law on mergers and acquisitions was somewhat outdated in the light of fast-moving economic changes in our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The philosophy underlying part IV of the Trade Practices Act 1974 is the protection and enhancement of competition. Implicit in part IV is the assumption that acts or occurrences which substantially lessen competition contravene the Act, unless authorised by the Trade Practices Commission on public benefit grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the existence of section 50, which specifies the dominance test in the area of merger regulation, is difficult to reconcile with the essential thrust of the Act, which is directed to preventing anti-competitive conduct. It is perhaps useful to recall that it was the then Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, who, in 1977, changed the then existing test to lessen competition to one of dominance to enable the takeover of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald and</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekly Times</EMPHASIS> by the Murdoch companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the question of section 50 and the test that should be applied to mergers and acquisitions, the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs acknowledged business concerns that the law governing mergers should be certain and predictable. The Committee noted and adopted the observations made in the 1984 OECD report on merger policies and recent trends in mergers, to the effect that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Member countries should make as transparent as possible the criteria they apply (to mergers). . . Such criteria could include for instance the determination of the relevant market&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I would add, that includes international markets&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in merger analysis, the level of concentration in the market, barriers to entry and factors relating to the firm's conduct and performance.</PARA>
<PARA>While the section 50 dominance threshold has been in operation since 1977, it has accumulated a body of interpretive law. However, between 1974 and 1977, the alternative threshold of substantially lessening competition was used, and that also accumulated a substantial body of legal precedent which has given it a degree of certainty. The Committee held the view that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes to section 50 should not be introduced lightly. This is because amendments to the Trade Practices Act may well bring about uncertainty which should not be readily risked.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the other hand, if reform is needed, it should be made unless the harm caused by it outweighs the good obtained. The Committee considers that change is needed to section 50 of the Trade Practices Act and that the benefit likely to flow from it will clearly outweigh any detriment that may arise.</PARA>
<PARA>In making the recommendation that the test be changed, the Committee paid a great deal of heed to the work of Professor Michael Porter. Briefly, Professor Michael Porter argues that internal competition is more beneficial in getting industry more competitive in international markets than the mere size of industry. Much has been made of the fact that Professor Michael Porter's work does not include a specific study on Australian industry. However, Australia is not so different from other OECD countries and Professor Porter's work spans a lot of assessments in OECD countries of which we should take note. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Committee's recommendations should be taken very seriously indeed by the Government. We are going through a period where a lot of government enterprises are being privatised, and we must be careful that we do not exchange a public monopoly for a private monopoly. We must also be careful that, in a period of deregulation, the interests of consumers are protected. Last but not least, we must pay attention to Professor Porter's thesis that our international competitiveness will be best enhanced if we have competitive conditions obtaining in our domestic industries. I believe that, therefore, it must be a matter of some regret that some press reports seem to indicate that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) is still considering whether or not the Government will adopt this recommendation. I trust that the decision has not yet been made and that the Attorney-General is open to argument on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a final point, even if, on the basis of lessening competition without looking at any other factors, the decision is reached that a particular merger should not proceed, there is the possibility open&mdash;and this is anchored in the legislation&mdash;that, nevertheless, such a merger may be authorised if there is a net public benefit to be derived. I believe that that is a safety catch provision which should be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, arguments have been led to the effect that this imposes a considerable burden on the companies seeking to merge or to take another company over. However, it seems to me that when a company engages in such an exercise, it will assess the industry, the possible markets and relative capacities. Therefore, the basic research and material that would need to be advanced to obtain authorisation is already collected and simply needs to be compiled. On these grounds, I would once again call on the Government to think very long and hard before this recommendation of the Committee is rejected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this report the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs deals with the duties and responsibilities of company directors and notes that any change in the regulation of directors activities `must be warranted and a sensible balance must be found between measures necessary to promote corporate activity in a way which will be of benefit to all' and the individual interests of directors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report deals with the duties directors owe under company law to entities outside the company. The case law has in recent times imposed a duty on directors to creditors, and this is considered in chapter 5 of the report. The basis for this development is the closeness of the relationship between a company at times of insolvency or near insolvency and its creditors. Often at these times directors will have dealt with the assets of creditors rather than the assets of the company's owners. The courts have decided that in those circumstances directors owe duties to creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In chapter 6, the Committee considers the interests of entities other than the company, the shareholders and creditors, and the extent to which directors are entitled to take account of extrinsic factors in their decision making. However, the main duty that directors owe is clearly to shareholders of the company. In this sense, they are the trustees of the company's activity and assets. The duty of directors in taking particular decisions in the marketplace has been the subject of considerable debate and legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 2 of the report is that a business judgment rule be introduced into Australian company law to set the objective standard, as recommended by recommendation 1, for a director's duty of care. This rule is currently part of American jurisprudence. The purpose of the rule is to provide special protection to directors who make informed business decisions; that is, directors who make a business judgment in good faith. However, the Government, in its response to the report, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not at this stage convinced that it is appropriate to introduce in isolation this one aspect of American jurisprudence into the Australian law on directors' duties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The draft currently placed on the public record for general discussion&mdash;the Corporate Law Reform Bill 1992&mdash;deals with this matter in section 232 by listing a number of criteria which should be used in assessing whether a director has met the obligation which would otherwise be expressed in the business judgment rule. The items listed for criteria include the following. The information that the officer has required; the meetings that the officer has attended; how far the officer has exercised an active discretion in the matters concerned; what the officer did to ensure that the corporation made adequate arrangements; what arrangements have been made to ensure that decisions made by one person on the corporation's behalf were in fact adequately monitored; and what arrangements were made to ensure that persons who have made decisions on the corporation's behalf had adequate information about the subject matter of the decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been argued recently by corporate lawyers and business organisations that this black letter law, in specifically describing the criteria that must be met before a director is judged to have met his obligations and discharged his duty of care, is too onerous and too detailed. However, since it merely describes&mdash;admittedly in some detail&mdash;the criteria that could be used in assessing what a discharging of a particular director's duty is, I cannot help feeling that these criticisms are misplaced and that this enumeration is helpful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area which has come under criticism is that of loans to directors. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has indicated that he might consider changing the fairly detailed black letter requirements in the draft legislation to one that is more general and enables some discretion in its interpretation. I would caution against law that is too fuzzy, if I can use that expression. In the 1980s we experienced a period where the corporate cowboys brought our business world and its practices into disrepute. I believe that we should encourage the Attorney-General to bring into this House legislation directed towards rectifying and preventing such behaviour in the future to restore the reputation of our businessmen in the eyes of the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the final report of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure with respect to the proposal for a very fast train. It is surprising to note how Australia seems to have forgotten the very fast train project in the past six or seven months. I will later suggest why I believe that interest has disappeared.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry was brought about to consider the very fast train proposal from Sydney to Melbourne. It was to decide on either the sea route or the inland route. In time the project was to have been extended to Brisbane and Adelaide, though I doubt whether it ever would have reached Perth. There are various reasons why this proposal could go ahead. In the limited time that I have available to me on this report, I will address the topic as to how the Committee saw the project and refer to some of its final recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommended that a project such as this could proceed without government assistance. I believe that would have been the way to go. That does not mean that that should preclude taxation incentives&mdash;not necessarily a tax holiday but, say, a tax deferral system such as that used in other parts of the world. This project has often been compared with the Snowy River scheme and the North West Shelf gas line. These sorts of projects take a lot of finance to get off the ground but, even though these things can be done by private enterprise, government can play a role in getting them underway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's terms of reference did not cover all the aspects of the very fast train proposal. As the inquiry continued, more terms of reference could have been added, but the inquiry could not go on for ever.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proponents may yet decide&mdash;and this report is fairly old now&mdash;that the project is not to proceed. Indeed, I understand they have decided not to proceed at present as the project is not financially viable at the moment. In my view the project is not proceeding at present because of the recession. A recession of this kind has been unheard of since the 1930s, but we are starting to get beyond that point&mdash;even Senator Collins would admit that. </PARA>

Because we are in a recession, this worthwhile project need not be shelved for ever. The Committee put a lot of work into a report which will find its way onto a lot of shelves. The economy undoubtedly will pick up under a Hewson government. At that time, with the expansion of industry, the expansion of population and the expansion of the economy of Australia, I believe this project can be looked at again. A lot of the groundwork&mdash;whether financial, basic engineering or high-tech engineering&mdash;has already been done. In future different proponents will be able to pick up the project and cause it to take off. The inquiry could have gone on forever and a day;  terms of reference would have been added as more problems or benefits from a very fast train arose over the years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four governments were involved in the original reference&mdash;the Victorian Government, the New South Wales Government, the ACT Government and the Federal Government. They worked together pretty well. I hope that those four governments do not forget the project altogether in years to come. Irrespective of whatever happens to the project in the future&mdash;whether it goes ahead in the next 10 years or not&mdash;I believe that some valuable work has been done. Processes like this open the eyes of governments, industries and all sorts of other organisations around Australia to what can be done with technology and transport. The Snowy River scheme, the North West Shelf gas line and, in 1903, the Kalgoorlie water supply were all big projects that were mooted but sat there waiting for someone to have a go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ernie Bridge, the Minister for Water Resources in Western Australia, has a concept of bringing water down from the north-west. Many people are criticising that proposal, but I am certainly not criticising it. It was not totally his idea, but he is the latest person to run with it. I wish Mr Bridge good luck. He has been criticised by many people, including my colleagues in Western Australia. In time, that project will be implemented. None of us in this chamber will be around to see it, but I believe that a project like that will get under way. The same will happen with the VFT. I believe that when we have the right population, the right economy and the right sort of government in Australia, that project will get off the ground. </PARA>

I was only a member of the Committee towards the end when I became a token replacement for Senator Reid. I recognise her work on that Committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;On 7 November 1990, the Senate referred the issue of anti-dumping and countervailing legislation to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. This was as a result of an inquiry initiated by Senator Ron Boswell, who at that stage had a well developed sense of protection towards Australia's industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the following several months, the Industry, Science and Technology Committee made a very thorough inquiry of all the people who claimed to have been affected. Evidence was heard from organisations and people such as the dairy farmers of Victoria; the Australian Dairy Industry Conference; the canned fruit industry of Australia; Castle Bacon Pty Ltd; the Food and Beverage Importers Association; the National Industry Associations Anti-Dumping Task Force; horticultural growers; titanium dioxide pigment manufacturers; the Victorian State Government; the Society for Balanced Free Trade; the Winemakers Federation of Australia; the United Farmers and Stockowners; citrus growers; the Dried Fruits Association; Murray citrus growers; Berrivale Orchards Ltd; the South Australian Canning Fruit Growers Association; Murray Valley Citrus Marketing Board; canegrowers; the Navy Bean Marketing Board; Connor Shea Napier Ltd; Queensland Pork Producers State Council; the Australian Customs Service; the National Farmers Federation; the Metal Trades Industry Association; apparel importers; the Australian Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers Association; the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; the cement industry; pasta producers; CSR; and others. It was a very thorough inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We took evidence from all these people who had or believed that they had experience of dumping or countervailing. We heard all sorts of different reasons as to why they suffered or believed they suffered. I really believe that by the time the inquiry finished, the Committee members were well and truly assured that the main problem that had arisen was the variation in the value of the Australian dollar relative to our trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that most of the troubles we suffer in our trade are linked entirely to the value of our dollar. While I certainly would not want to talk the dollar down, it is very clear to everybody who watches the trade weighted index of our dollar that the figure at which it is now on the market is quite unrealistic. If the dollar were priced in relation to our trade weighted index, our trading position would improve markedly overnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel tremendously sorry for many of those whom I have mentioned&mdash;the sugar, fruit and dairy people and the small industries which make specific things and which find that it is possible to have similar goods dumped on our doorstep by overseas countries. The end of the line processing, whereby a certain amount left over in a country is just sent overseas so that that country can get what it can, may wreck an industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also predatory dumping. Countries are carefully looked at with a view to seeing where a product can be discharged onto a market to slowly but surely erode that home market and destroy it. At present, this may be what has happened to the asparagus market. It has certainly happened with much of the apparel and footwear industries and with various machine tools and engines and so on in that line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of all the things that we deal with in this Parliament, nothing is more difficult to deal with than dumping. In the world of trade and commerce, nothing is more difficult to cope with than dumping. It is so hard to see and prove. I hear of many people who have, or who believe they have, problems involving dumping. We have to look at them very carefully. What is most difficult is that those claims have to be dealt with expeditiously. That is not easy either. It takes time to make thorough investigations. There are often times when what looks like dumping is not; it may be variations of costs or values in other places and other reasons. So it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee made various recommendations about the manner in which this issue should be dealt with. We came to the conclusion that there were variations in the procedures which could be attended to and that we should continue our efforts through GATT to get a more responsible attitude by other countries on how this should be handled. We believe that the system of dealing through Customs and the dumping authority was too clumsy; there was no need to be dealing with two different authorities in the one area. I believe that the time factors recommended looked all right at that stage. However, I am pleased to say that the coalition's recently publicised dumping policy provides for an even shorter time. I am sure that it can be met and still provide all the justice that is necessary for both sides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear to the Committee that there is still room for improvement in the legislation. It will still be possible for us to make it less attractive for people to dump produce into Australian markets for whatever reason. The Committee recommended that the Customs Service be empowered to conduct confidential examinations of dumping complaints using information suppressed or aggregated on confidentiality grounds where complainants can demonstrate there is sufficient evidence that dumping is occurring. This is not possible at present. But this recommendation gives us an opportunity to get at the books and the figures that would otherwise be impossible to get at. We recommended that there be a review of the application of confidentiality provisions to the import statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went to several places and we interviewed a lot of witnesses here in Parliament House. We made field inspections in various States. We brought down this report in June 1991. For anybody interested or involved in the dumping or countervailing area, the report is quite a helpful reference. As far as the Government is concerned, the Committee's report shows that there are ways to improve the handling of dumping or countervailing problems in the community. All in all, I think it was a very useful exercise. The members of the Committee found it a very helpful and educative process to delve into this subject to the depth that we did. Anybody involved in industry and commerce or in law or accounting would find it beneficial to get a copy of this report and read it from cover to cover. It is well worth while. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will briefly address the report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology into Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing legislation. My remarks will be directed towards the anti-dumping measures. Perhaps the history books will record that this week was the week of tariffs and, more particularly, sugar tariffs. On 1 July the Government is going to decrease the tariff on sugar from $77 to $55. The legislation to do this was put in place some 12 months ago. As 1 July approaches, the focus is coming back to this tariff reduction and Queensland sugar growers are letting the rest of Australia know what their problems are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though the time taken to bring in anti-dumping action has been far too long, I believe that an improved anti-dumping system will have its future in Australia. It will be more important as tariffs continue to be removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past 12 months or two years, we have heard how different organisations and industries around Australia are being affected by dumped products on the world market. We are told that the world price for sugar is corrupt. There are signs that that is the case. So rather than keep the tariff in place, we should introduce anti-dumping measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard from banana growers, pea growers, tomato growers and pineapple growers. A tomato cannery in Cowra is closing down this week or next week. The big issue for the last few years, which Senator Cook may know something about, has been the pig producers' complaint on imported pig meat from Canada. I know that all of the problems that the industries have told us about are alive and well. They are really there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way the Australian Government is going, those industries will not be able to get their internal costs down as they will under the Hewson package. At the present moment we have a Labor government which is not changing the economic strategy so as to get those internal costs down. When tariffs are removed and these industries are exposed to the world market, they have problems. In the short term that is where anti-dumping will have a part to play. I suggest to the sugar industry that where there are problems, anti-dumping is the way to go, especially until we can get around to lowering the internal costs which are stopping Australian industries from competing with the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Archer pointed out that small industries in Australia&mdash;not big by world standards&mdash;like tomatoes, peas, pineapples and asparagus, can be wiped out in 12 months. A company that has a surplus can target Australia and dump its goods here this year and that Australian industry will be wiped out. Next year, perhaps that company does not have a surplus to dump, or it finds somewhere else to dump where it may get more money for its goods, but the Australian industry will have been wiped out. It means that the prices for those goods to the consumer would treble from the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important for anti-dumping actions to be taken the right way and that we have a good system put in place so that if an industry needs protection from corrupt world prices, that can be done. In the past 12 months we have told the sugar industry, the banana industry, the pea growers and the tomato growers that anti-dumping is the way to go. When it comes to other industries, I wish the Government would practice what it preaches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the importation of second-hand cars from Japan and other parts of the world. Senator Button told us emphatically, in answer to a backbench question from Senator Foreman, that he would protect the Australian car industry&mdash;whether new or second-hand&mdash;to the nth degree. He would put in place a $12,000 tariff. If that measure is not enough&mdash;he would like to make it higher&mdash;he would find some other measure to keep those imported second-hand cars out of Australia. Why has he not told them? The other day I shouted across the chamber, `Send them out to anti-dumping'. His answer was, `That shows you what you know about anti-dumping'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the second hand car industry&mdash;and such cars are value added in Australia&mdash;needs protection, is not anti-dumping the way to go? I know it will take 12 months or more to put the anti-dumping system in place, but why not go out there&mdash;and Senator Foreman may like to tell me why the Government does not go out there&mdash;and take that action?  Then see whether there is a tariff. I do not know why it is not an ad valorem rate instead of a flat figure of $12,000, but I believe we are dealing with only one type of vehicle, so I suppose a flat figure would be as good as any. So we will forgive Senator Button for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chemical industry sometimes takes anti-dumping action. Even though it does not manufacture chemicals in Australia&mdash;it gets the base component from the United States and mixes it with a solution here&mdash;the industry behaves as though it manufactures the chemical and demands tariffs on other imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This second-hand car industry was importing good five-year-old second-hand cars from Japan, which is much less than the age of the average car in Australia. During Estimates, the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce could not tell us the average age of cars in Australia, even though it recommended against letting these cars in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government believes that these prices are a result of anti-dumping measures. Japan, for instance, has a limit of five years in which one can register a car. It can be registered for longer, but there are punitive measures in the way of licences if one wishes to do so. That may depress the market for those cars. Who says that they are being dumped? Why will the Minister not tell the Australian car industry to do the same and go down the anti-dumping track? Not having the fortitude to send them out to anti-dumping, I presume that the Industry Commission or the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce would have had a far-reaching inquiry to find out why the car industry needs $12,000 if they are being dumped. At Estimates we were told that it did not carry out an inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where do we go? What will it be next week? Will we be importing second-hand engines, tyres or new tyres? We will just go on and on. I suggest to the Government that if it wants to get the rural industry to take anti-dumping action instead of imposing tariffs&mdash;I believe tariffs should be cut out by the year 2000, as is our policy&mdash;why not send the car industry or any other industry, such as the motorbike industry or the tractor industry, to anti-dumping if it is frightened of second-hand machines coming in?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991 is a sad and sorry tale of government intransigence. It is a case of unbalanced reporting of the issues in my home State in Tasmania, so much so that my colleagues and I spent thousands of dollars to get some of the unreported story told to our constituents by way of advertisements. It perhaps says something about the power of mighty companies in Australia. It also says a lot about the importance of this pulp mill to the economy of my State, whereby jobs are so desperately needed for young Tasmanians in particular that the pulp mill would almost be accepted on any terms in order to try to turn around our economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us who represent the State of Tasmania here have a responsibility not only to represent the State and its interests but also to act as members of a house of review. This legislation is totally unacceptable in its present form. As members of a house of review scrutinising government legislation, we were honour bound not to allow it to go through in its original form and in its existing form, unfortunately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over many months negotiations have gone on and attempts have been made by the Opposition to have the Government look again at its legislation. In this we were supported by the industry, which recognised that only a handful of major pulp mills stood to get any benefit from the protection that was supposedly provided under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fact that practically everybody who looked at the legislation wanted it changed, the Government was not even prepared to consider the matter. When we compare that with the way legislation is routinely treated in this place, a way is usually found for majority views to be accommodated and for amendments to be put into place which will lead to an improvement in the legislation, which will facilitate industry and which will lead to consensus amongst the political parties. That is the normal way that things happen in this place, although the press would have people believe otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extraordinary that this piece of legislation was somehow cut out for very special treatment. I am glad to see that it is acknowledged by the adviser to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), who has just managed to slip him a wink. We know very well that the Government had another agenda on this legislation. That is very sad. As I said earlier&mdash;Senator Aulich would realise this only too well&mdash;the jobs of Tasmanians are involved in this and it is too important for governmental games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The negotiations creaked along to little or no effect until such time that the matter came up for second reading debate in this place and the Senate decided to send the legislation to a committee. Mr Temporary Chairman, you would recall that that Committee took evidence over three days. I was there to hear all the witnesses. One of the things that was so noticeable was that on the first day every single witness told the Committee that this legislation needed to be amended. The second interesting thing about that first day of evidence was how the Tasmanian newspapers did not print a single word of that evidence. Any Tasmanian not getting mainland newspapers would have no idea that anybody other than the five Tasmanian Liberal senators believed that this legislation was crook. But in fact the ACTU, the major union representing the forest industry workers&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, he is always helpful. He takes people's places in Senate tickets too, I understand. The ACTU, the major union involved, the National Association of Forest Industries, Petersville-Sleigh, which operates a number of major forestry concerns in our State, and APPM all acknowledged that this legislation was very flawed and needed amending.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">APPM was honest enough to say that, despite the fact that the legislation needed amendment, it was all right for its purposes and APPM would accept it as it was. I recognise that the commercial necessities of life tend to make corporations look to the narrow self-interest, so I do not aim to be casting blame on APPM. But APPM was at least prepared to acknowledge publicly that it would be the only beneficiary of the legislation. That was something that the Government has consistently refused, until recently, to acknowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the things that we have had to advertise in the Tasmanian newspapers about the failure of this legislation are: that the legislation provides no compensation if resources are taken away by the Commonwealth; that there is no resource security for sawmillers; that there is no provision in the legislation for State or regional forest industry plans; and that Canberra will have increased powers on land use matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last decade or so in Tasmania we have had a very sorry tale to tell with respect to Canberra's involvement in our land use, and any thinking Tasmanian would be very wary of allowing something to go through in a defective form in this place for the sake of one project if it meant that Canberra's land use powers were going to be increased. We have suffered too much for too long to grasp the immediate benefit for the sake of long term damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We continued, on this side, to hold out for an improvement to the legislation, believing that the Government could not be prepared to play politics to the wire on this important legislation. We have tried everything we could to get the Government to change its mind on this. Then, after Easter, the National Association of Forest Industries received a letter from the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths). The letter that was initiated by him straight after Easter proposed a meeting with the industry association. There have been some speeches earlier in the day trying to muddy the water on this, but the initiative after Easter came from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Griffith's office arranged a meeting with the industry for Monday of this week. The Minister suggested that he should have negotiations with the industry and he set out the parameters within which he could negotiate. He said that he would have to go back to Cabinet for approval, but he indicated that he felt it was within his scope to negotiate. Two days of negotiations led to an agreement by Tuesday afternoon of this week. The agreement was between Mr Griffiths, the National Association of Forest Industries, Forest Industries Association of Tasmania, the Tasmanian Government and the Forestry Protection Society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the agreement was reached, the National Association of Forest Industries took that agreement to the Opposition on Tuesday afternoon of this week. The Opposition indicated informally that it would receive a positive response, and NAFI indicated this to the Government. Mr Griffith's office then said that a formal letter would come from the Government to the Opposition seeking formal endorsement to the agreement. NAFI was once told that the formal letter was 15 minutes away. There were a number of other promises about when it would be received, and then the Association of Forest Industries was told that the Government would not support the agreement; that was yesterday afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Lloyd's endeavours in this matter were purely in response to the Minister, Mr Griffiths. Mr Lloyd was not offering concessions; they were being negotiated between the Government and the industry and they were endorsed by the Opposition after agreement was reached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That agreement was in writing by the Minister responsible for resources; the Minister responsible for this legislation. Yet when the Minister went to his leadership he was left in the lurch, he was not supported, and I remind the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) who is at the table just what that means for the future. It is no longer just a question of resource security. The question is: does anybody in this country in the future have any confidence on any negotiations or agreements reached with a Minister in this Government? The agreement was believed by all the parties including the Minister to be a firm agreement in writing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who can believe this Government or any Minister in future? There is a Minister, holding himself out to be operating within the parameters for which he had an entitlement to negotiate: negotiating a position; putting it in writing; having it endorsed by the Opposition as well as the industry; and then being dumped by his Prime Minister because of the pull and power of the left wing faction of the Labor Party. This means that nobody can trust any agreement negotiated with a Minister in this Government again. Does Senator Cook have authority to negotiate as Minister Griffiths negotiated? When can anybody trust the word of a Minister in the Keating Government again?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an extremely serious allegation, as I am sure the Minister will realise. That is why the Minister should let his Government consider this very seriously over this weekend because it is no longer just a question of resource security; it is a question of the reputation and the credibility of the Keating Government. It will have an extremely difficult job to do in the year ahead if its word and the word of its Ministers cannot be relied upon. This is an important piece of legislation for my State, but it has now become a very important piece of legislation for the credibility and the trustworthiness of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people in this country would like to get rid of this Government right now. Sadly, until Mr Keating calls an election, they will not have that opportunity. But the events of the last few days over this piece of legislation are but one more nail in the coffin of this Government because, when a government has lost its credibility, with what does it clothe itself?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is appropriate that I follow Senator Newman as a Tasmanian senator and one who is particularly intrigued by the demeanour of Senator Newman tonight, compared with the usual rambunctious, argumentative and dominating type of approach that she normally takes. She is, in fact, extremely subdued tonight, and I think she has a very good reason. For the first time she has found that opposing government legislation has not borne the appropriate political support that she thought she would get.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is good. It appropriately will achieve what the Government wants to do. Senator Newman has some problem with it. She has a problem with it primarily because the Government brought it in. A Labor Government did something which allows an industry, and conservationists for that matter, to know the procedures. At least the procedures are laid down so that people can process an application, a project, in an orderly way and in a way that is predictable and gives people of all persuasions and interests the opportunity to have their say. That, in itself, is an achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does Senator Newman oppose the legislation? I still have not worked out why. She finds that most people do not share her views. Somehow or other she is unable to get through to the community at large her real reason for opposing Labor Government legislation. So what does she do? She blames unbalanced reporting in her home State of Tasmania. Is this not wonderful?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Newman, who is now about to walk out of the chamber because she cannot stand the heat, blames the newspapers in Tasmania. I have never heard her blame the media in Tasmania before because, on the whole, in the past they looked after her party pretty well, as I found out after 15 years in politics in that State. But on this issue, Senator Newman finds that the newspapers north and south do not agree with her. How naughty of them! So she blames the newspapers to begin with and the media as a whole. `Unbalanced reporting', she says. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then Senator Newman makes personal remarks about the various members of this Senate. She says that I do not live in Tasmania. Yet at least three letters from Senator Newman seem to have arrived in my letterbox over the last couple of years saying nice things about my home town and so on. And yet Senator Newman says that I do not live there. She is leaving again. She cannot stand the heat so she gets out of the kitchen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Newman makes personal remarks about advisers in this place. Quite frankly, I find that pretty inappropriate. The gestures, the mannerisms and the seating position of advisers are not matters for senators in this place to comment on. Those advisers do not have the opportunity to reply. I do not mind what Opposition senators say about other senators in this place, provided that it is within Standing Orders, but it is inappropriate and unfair to talk about an adviser in this place. Senator Newman has done that. She is leaving the chamber because she cannot bear to listen to the issues being discussed. She also tries to browbeat North Broken Hill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman. Once again, we have a cheap attempt to interrupt what I am saying. So we get back to the response of Senator Newman to the fact that everyone does not believe everything she says. What does she try to do? She and others try to browbeat North Broken Hill. They try to take on a company and say, `You aren't supporting us. You should support us. After all, we are Liberals. We support capitalist enterprises and you should therefore support us per se'. That is the sort of thinking that belonged to the Melbourne Club in 1930. It does not belong in Australia of 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition senators can make as much noise as they like but the simple fact is that I am going to have my say on this one. I have listened to them for long enough. I have listened to the noises they have made in the newspapers and looked at their paid advertisements. Their points are not getting through because they are not making them consistently or intelligently. That is the reason the media and most of the industry at the moment do not particularly like what members of the Opposition are saying and why the coverage they are getting is very poor indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Newman then goes on, having attacked advisers, the media, North Broken Hill, me and other honourable senators in this chamber, to blame the left unions&mdash;the old bogey. We have moved from the 1930s of the Melbourne Club approach to the 1950s Menzies approach&mdash;we blame the left unions for this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that this legislation has been introduced because it is a logical and fair way to approach this issue. Those people who live in States where there has not been a veritable civil war going on in terms of the use of natural resources ought to look at the Tasmanian situation where, over the years, all the political parties have made a proper mess of it. Opposition senators can come in here and blame one political party or another. But the simple fact is that the politics of Tasmania have not been good in terms of sensible, long term decisions being made about the proper uses of natural resources in that State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, Senator Newman talks about the intervention of the Federal Government in these matters. If the Federal Government had not intervened, we would have had a billion dollar dam on our hands which very few people would need. In other words, we have sufficient power in Tasmania to meet the needs of industry. Yet the Opposition was totally in favour of building that dam. Senator Watson and former Senator Peter Rae were the only ones with any sense to look at the whole thing and say, `That dam would have been an economic and environmental disaster'. So, with the exception of Senator Watson, their track record on major issues relating to resource development has not been a particularly good one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for Senator Newman to come in here and blame the left wing unions; to blame the Tasmanian media for being anti-Liberal, for heaven's sake; and to blame the advisers and everyone around the place. The simple fact is she has no rational argument that she can use to oppose this legislation. If Senator Newman opposes the legislation simply because it is brought forward by a Labor Government, she ought to say so. She ought to say, `Look, I am voting against it because of my political prejudices and because I believe that people I thought were my friends in industry will not support me'. She should give some real reason appropriate to the particular approach that she is taking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Tasmania we have looked at how one should strike that balance, year in year out, between the proper use of natural resources, protection of the environment and the development of the State to create jobs. It is not an easy task because there are conflicting and sometimes irreconcilable differences. But those differences will only be reconciled if people of goodwill from all political parties get together on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet we find that the views, for example, of the Liberal Premier of Tasmania, Ray Groom, have been totally ignored by the five Tasmanian Liberal Senators.

Although not perfect, this legislation does as well as any legislation could.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition senators have a responsibility to examine that legislation without political prejudice, to set aside their political prejudices and to join with the Government. They are being universally criticised by the Tasmanian media, by the union movement, by the Liberal State Premier of Tasmania and by major industries in that State. Surely it ought to be getting through to them that they have taken the wrong path. They have done so out of political prejudice. They have taken the opportunity to score points rather than work their way through this legislation. If they had started with the right attitude that they wanted to make this thing work, it might have helped. But they started with the attitude that they simply wanted to make trouble for this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not put all Liberal senators in that category. I exclude Senator Watson from that statement. He is a person who genuinely tries to work through the issues, who in fact has a better knowledge of economic realities than the majority of his comrades over there, and who in some ways has been railroaded by his colleagues&mdash;other people, noisier people&mdash;in the Tasmanian Liberal senator faction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tasmanian Liberal senator faction has stopped being the voice of the developers in Tasmania, because there are many sensible developers in that State who are fed up with the Liberal senators. The demeanour of Senator Newman tonight was a very good example of the effect of this behaviour. Liberal senators know that they went down the wrong track. The Liberal Premier in Tasmania has told them so, as have many of their Party members, yet they still do not get the point. It is not only that they are attempting to save pride; they are simply not prepared to look at this issue on its merits and go with us on this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Parliament needs the support of those opposite in order to bury once and for all this endemic civil war that we have been having in Tasmania on the use of natural resources. If we do not do something about this matter in the next year or so, it will go on and on in that State to the detriment of the people who believe in conserving their natural resources, those who believe in developing them, and those who take the middle position. The people of Tasmania are with politicians and the way we are handling this issue. In increasing numbers the people are saying so. Tasmanian politics, particularly in the State Parliament, is polarised to the level where it is becoming a laughing-stock; where neither of the two major political parties seem to be able to galvanise the community behind them. There is a very good reason for that, and that has been shown by the attitude that those opposite have taken here tonight on this particular issue. </PARA>

Most of the remarks that have been made so far on both sides have not really been related in any way to the amendment that is about to be put.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak to the title of the Bill rather than to the point of order raised by Senator Coulter. However, before discussing the short title&mdash;which is that `This Act may be cited as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Forest Conservation and Development Act 1991</EMPHASIS>'&mdash;I have a point to make about Senator Tambling's proposed amendment:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 1, page 1, omit `development', substitute `major projects'. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is quite right to put the matter in that way. On 26 March the Standing Committee on Selection of Bills referred this legislation to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. That Committee was set the fairly daunting task of examining the legislation, calling witnesses and reporting back to the Senate by 2 April. It was made very clear to me that this Bill would not give me or Senator Faulkner, as senators from New South Wales, or our State the resource security that hopefully was to be given to one specific project in Tasmania. That is the point that Senator Tambling, on behalf of the Opposition, is fairly making in his amendment that seeks to change the title of the Bill. If all honourable senators in this chamber had read the evidence, I believe that they would take the same view. They would say, `What will it do for all the other projects around Australia that seek resource security?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee deliberated and deliberated and, having heard a fairly wide range of witnesses, eventually agreed. Before making any detailed comments about the validity of the evidence presented, I must note&mdash;as I did at the time&mdash;that it seems absurd that the conservation movement, in all its guises, was given several platforms at this inquiry and yet in each instance had the same spokesperson. Even Senator Coulter would agree that that was rather a pity. I do not think the Democrats were able to make their points to the Committee as clearly as would have occurred if they had had different people speaking on the different issues. Given the critical time frame, I thought that was foolish and I think they actually wasted the time of the Committee by having the same people speaking all the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators will be aware, a number of senators&mdash;namely, Senator Calvert, Senator Crane and myself&mdash;moved a dissenting report. In that dissenting report we noted that we had the support of all Opposition Tasmanian senators. We disagreed with the main Committee on two issues. First, the Opposition amendments put to the Committee were a genuine attempt to provide appropriate legislation for the industry. Our amendments were supported by the industry. If accepted, they would have saved this Bill and made it meaningful for the overwhelming bulk of the forestry industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point was that the Bill be agreed to without amendment. Again, we had to disagree with the majority of Committee members. In our opposition we again had the support of the industry and the trade union movement. In fact, there was not one industry or union that actually supported the Bill as presented to the Committee. Any fairminded senator who read the evidence would reach the same conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the comment by the Minister for Resources, Mr Griffiths, that he wanted this legislation to pass, even if flawed, so that it could be tested out in the community. I do not believe that it is our job in this place to allow legislation to be carried knowing that it is flawed and expecting the community to sort through its deficiencies. That is not the Senate's job. The Senate's job is to approve legislation that comes to this place if the House of Representatives has done the right thing. I do not want to be too parochial, but there are times when the Senate plays a magnificent role in the government of Australia because we sort out the badly framed legislation, fix it up and send it back to the House of Representatives for it to act on our improvements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the attitude of the Minister is horrific if he expects people out in the community to check out the legislation to see if it does or does not work. I think that explains why so much legislation has been proposed by the Keating Labor Government and by its predecessor, the Hawke Government. The legislation has been faulty and this place has fixed it up. In most cases it has fixed it up in a way that has been a credit to members on both sides of this chamber. It is almost as though the Government has its very own job creation scheme in the rewriting of Bills. I do not think that is any way to run a government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One point I did not make when I started to talk about the short title of this Bill was that the Minister made a comment to the chamber earlier tonight&mdash;Senator Cook, of course, was the Minister for Resources and, I believe, a worthwhile Minister for Resources&mdash;that the forests were a finite resource. If I am wrong I will apologise, but I am pretty sure I am right in saying that the Minister said that. The Minister, whom I admired for the job he did as far as the national soil conservation program is concerned, made a fatal error by saying that, because forests are not a finite resource, they are a renewable resource. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Minister said earlier tonight that they were a finite resource. I was surprised to hear him say it because I know that he is a former Minister in this portfolio. That just did not strike quite true to his aspirations, the things he has said and the commonsense he spoke with when he was the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will speak for a minute about Minister Griffiths. If one reads the paper&mdash;I believe what I read in the paper; it is not always completely correct, but in most cases it is reasonably correct and picks up the story, as we all know&mdash;one will see that it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minister Griffiths was scuttled yesterday by the Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kelly, and the ALP Left.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After three days of intense negotiations, Mr Griffiths had stitched up a deal between the Opposition, formerly bitter opponents of the legislation, the forestry industry and the Tasmanian Government which involved only minor amendments. He was then told by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, that he would also have to secure the agreement of Mrs Kelly and the left faction of the ALP before the deal could go ahead. Mrs Kelly and the Left took the opportunity to dump the legislation they had bitterly opposed when it was forced through the Cabinet by the then Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke, last year.</PARA>
<PARA>Listen to this point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Keating, then Treasurer, also vehemently argued against the legislation at that Cabinet meeting.</PARA>
<PARA>So he has done a bit of a back flip. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After he became Prime Minister, Mr Keating announced during the Tasmanian election campaign, where the State ALP supported the plan, that the previous Cabinet decision would stand.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a bit of a change there, I think. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I would like to make is that Minister Griffiths went to the Forest Industry Association of Tasmania and he went to the Tasmanian Government. He also stitched up a deal with the Forest Protection Society which then went to the Opposition, to Mr Lloyd. Mr Lloyd then went back to Mr Griffiths to try to get a position so that this legislation could pass through this place. I know that Senator Tambling earlier here tonight has made the point&mdash;and has read out that negotiated agreement, or whatever people want to call it, that Mr Griffiths put together&mdash;that if that had been the case, that would have gone through here tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me back again to the short title of the Bill and the fact that it was going to be more project specific. In other words, the Bill was going to substitute for the word `Development' the words `major projects' which is the project people have been talking about in the State of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not personally believe that the flaw in this Bill is only in the title because I think it has omissions which are contained in quite a lot of other places as well. It is just as flawed as a lot of the other legislation, as I said earlier. I think the Government's total refusal to negotiate on Senator Tambling's proposed amendment really suggests a lack of commitment to the Bill, to the resource security and to the security of those employed in the industry and those who have invested in the industry. I quote again from the paper. I think it is Dr Robert Baume who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this legislation fails in the Senate tomorrow and thousands of jobs are lost in the forest industry, it is 100 per cent the Government's fault. Mr Griffiths has been left out on a limb.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know the Minister, Alan Griffiths, as well as I know the previous Minister, who is at the table at the moment, Senator Cook, but from dealings I have had with him, I think he is basically an honourable person. I feel very sorry that he has been scuttled by his own Party and by his Prime Minister who, as I said earlier, has done a couple of back flips as far as this is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation ought not to be just about big businesses because the forest industry itself is not just about big operators. There are myriad small operators. Many senators in previous debates have quoted from letters that they have received from some of those small operators. If those small operators are to get resource security all over Australia in all their different ways, this legislation will not give it to them because the evidence we have heard does not do it, unfortunately, and that is the reason why I take my position on this side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard all the evidence. Senator Cook gave evidence. I was obviously not entirely in agreement with him all the time. But I think if he looked into his eyes in the mirror in the morning or at night he would know in his own heart of hearts, having been a good former Minister for Resources, that he would have had some concerns about it as well. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now wish to talk a little about Western Australia. Charges have been made in here tonight by Senator Aulich. He was quite critical of politicians and the political process in Tasmania. In fact, the dead opposite has occurred in Western Australia in forestry development and management, such as the EHC-CALM agreement and its development. The forest is being managed in such a way that the various values of the forest are being preserved. For example, some wilderness areas have been put aside, there are national parks, areas for harvesting hardwood and wood chipping and a program of replanting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation in Western Australia is quite different from the position which exists in Tasmania, as the Minister would know. In its current form, this legislation has little chance of giving any security to the forest industry in Western Australia. I want to dwell on that point for a moment. The forest industry in Western Australia is made up of a number of minor players. When I say `minor players' I am talking about $100m projects. There could well be $10m, $15m or $20m projects such as the operations of CALM and the on-farm forestry plantation program. I acknowledge the work of the Hon. Julian Grill. I was involved very extensively with him in putting together an on-farm forestry policy. That was accepted by him as Minister and now stands as the principles under which forestry will be developed on private farms in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem we have is that the suggestion that various projects can be put together to build up the $100m is totally unrealistic. In fact, it is not attainable or achievable, purely and simply because the various arms of the forestry industry in Western Australia are locked in competition. They compete with one another in their operations. It is just not practical or achievable to try to get competitors together and put their businesses into one. In fact, if they did, we would find that the productivity which currently exists in the forestry industry in Western Australia would diminish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem is that, as the Minister would be well aware, selected areas are being harvested in Western Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to canvass issues which were televised tonight on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> relating to Pacific Dunlop's announcement of the closure of the Edgell plant at three sites in Australia. The one that concerns me most and the one that concerned the program is the Cowra factory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This plant has been in this town for about 50 years, so its technology is World War II vintage. It is a plant that, for those of us who were born and who have grown up in the town from World War II onwards, has always been there. Yesterday Pacific Dunlop announced the closure of this plant. It did so because it has recently taken over the company, Adsteam, which was having financial difficulties, and has had to rationalise&mdash;which is an appropriate and sensible business decision&mdash;the factories within this food processing industry. This has left Cowra, Greenacre and Bairnsdale in Victoria to be closed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More upsetting and more annoying, I think, is the fact that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> tonight could not let facts get in the way of a good story. I have to highlight some of the gross inaccuracies that were reported in this program. It talked about the dumping of tomatoes in Australia. It left one with the impression that the Federal Government only took action on this two days ago. That is either mischievous or displays a lack of knowledge of the subject or, if it was not unparliamentary, I would say it is a lie, but I have to find some other word to use. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1X4">Senator WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It could be, or it could be playing politics by some other people as well. I draw honourable senators' attention to a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> advertisement that appeared on Wednesday, 11 December 1991 for the Australian Customs Service. This was signed by Marion Estelle Grant, delegate of the Comptroller-General, and dated 5 December 1991. It is a preliminary finding into the alleged dumping and subsidisation of canned whole tomatoes, canned tomato pieces and canned crushed tomatoes in water or juice from Italy, Spain, Thailand and the People's Republic of China. The notice of inquiry was published on 27 August last year under a subsection of the Customs Act. A preliminary decision was made to take effect on or after 6 December 1981.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those people who do not understand&mdash;and I take one of those to be Ben Cheshire of the ABC&mdash;that means that that is when the countervailing duties start to be applied. Therefore, from 6 December of last year there have been no dumped tomatoes from those places coming into this country. The crop for this season's tomatoes did not commence to be harvested in the Cowra area until January 1992. I would also add as a by-line that, of course, imported tomatoes do have tariff applied to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely incorrect to say that we have no tariffs on this particular industry and that the tomatoes are being dumped, because quite clearly they are not being dumped and have not been dumped since 6 December last year. That, however, has not stopped honourable people around the place from asserting or giving people the impression that that is not the case. In an interview on this program we had Ben Cheshire saying that the Australian market, as every shopper knows, is being flooded with cheap subsidised tins&mdash;of tomatoes, I would presume&mdash;from Thailand, China and Europe. That is not accurate and I have just explained why it is not accurate, but he does not seem to have understood that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This week we had an announcement from the Minister that the Anti-Dumping Authority had upheld the Customs Service's finding of dumping of canned tomatoes. What has now taken place is that anti-dumping and countervailing levies have been applied to tomatoes for three years. So the industry and those involved in processing of tomatoes in this country know that those countries that do import tomatoes into this country&mdash;China, Thailand, Italy and Spain&mdash;will not be able to import their tomatoes without countervailing dumping being applied. This, of course, means that these tomatoes are not dumped and have not been dumped since December of last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who are interested would also get the impression from this program that we take no action on any products as far as dumping goes. I would just like to remind honourable senators that, since early 1991, dumping has been found with canned ham from Ireland, the Netherlands and Denmark; canned peaches and pears from China, Spain and Greece; dried eggwhite from Sweden and the Netherlands; glace cherries from France and Ireland; and now we have tomatoes. That indicates to me that we have taken action against any countries which are proved to be dumping processed primary produce into this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people care to read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> they will see that it is not uncommon to find preliminary dumping findings made by the Australian Customs Service. It happens, I would say, reasonably frequently and it belies the lies that are told and allegations that are made that this Government does not stop dumping. I think it is very important that we make sure that people know this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program dealt with Australia being the victim of world surpluses. There were allegations from Mr Armstrong, the New South Wales State Minister for agriculture, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> that Australia is rapidly becoming the victim of world surpluses and other processing countries that have tomatoes, beetroot or asparagus, for instance. It was said that when they have a surplus they look at Australia and say, `Oh, Australia, you're fairly relaxed about that'. I have proved that there is no dumping of tomatoes in Australia; there are countervailing levies and duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been no applications or approaches made to the Customs Service to investigate the possibility of there being dumping of beetroot and asparagus. I would urge any company which thinks there is dumping to contact the customer service liaison section in the Customs Service to discuss its concerns. The Customs Service and the Anti-Dumping Authority are very keen to act upon these sorts of things. They have a record of having done so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also draw the Senate's attention to the fact that we have one of the shortest periods within which this process has to take place. The key words on the dates and times within which this has to take place are `up to'. That means that it does not have to take the full time. I am told&mdash;I presume reliably&mdash;that in some cases the Customs Service has been able to put out a preliminary dumping finding within a couple of weeks of the prima facie case being brought to its attention. It is very important that people know this and stop running around the countryside perpetuating these untruths that Australia does absolutely nothing about dumping, and that Australia has removed all tariffs from processed primary produce, because it is not accurate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, Ben Cheshire left us with that impression. He said that two days ago the Anti-Dumping Authority announced steps to counteract dumping. That is too late for Cowra. I wish the gentleman had spoken to those people who know about the issue; he would have been informed otherwise. He also looked at the shelves and compared prices. He found that they were different. I think he needs to ask a few people why&mdash;perhaps he could start with New South Wales. I am told that New South Wales has tomato marketing orders. The companies have mentioned that that is an impediment to the efficient production in that State because it establishes a minimum price for tomatoes for processing for the growers. It means that the companies cannot be competitive because they have to pay excessive prices for their products. Perhaps Mr Armstrong might like to advise us of what he plans to do to make sure that the factories in his State can obtain produce at a fair and reasonable competitive price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning we had the New South Wales Minister for State Development, Mr Yabsley, saying that there was nothing the State could do to prevent the closure of the cannery in Cowra. Perhaps Mr Yabsley, as a good Liberal, might like to talk to Mr Armstrong, the National Party person, about the fact that there is a New South Wales tomato marketing order which is affecting the factories. Mr Yabsley might care to look at that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also get the impression from this article that Pacific Dunlop has closed down and walked away from the food processing operations altogether. One should be aware that it was not a closure announcement but a restructuring announcement. Pacific Dunlop will be concentrating on food processing in its seven remaining production centres throughout Australia. Over the next two years it will be investing $66m in major capital works. It will be upgrading the potato processing plant in Ulverstone, Tasmania, at $26m to make it the largest facility of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere. I wish that some of my colleagues from Tasmania were here to hear that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The factory in Bathurst, which is in receipt of a best practice award, will be getting an investment to increase its capacity for the `quick shot' range of microwave products. The vegetable canning capacity in Manly, Queensland, will be expanded by 40 per cent. Those are certainly not the actions of a company that is about to remove itself from the food processing business in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that people realise that a lot of untruths have been said. A lot of mischievous or inaccurate things have been said which have not done anything to help the people in Cowra overcome their grief at seeing a major and important structure in their town changed and removed. I feel very sad for them. I know that this Government will do all that it can to assist with retraining, education and that type of thing. The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) made that announcement today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to know the reason for the closure. When I spoke to the Pacific Dunlop plant I was given a lot of reasons as to why it was looking at closing or rationalising to close this plant. One of the reasons was the amount of money it was losing each year&mdash;in excess of $3m. Another reason included the availability of the produce and the reliability of the weather. I actually had to ask whether dumping was an issue. I was told that it might have been but, if it was, it was inconsequential. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cowra Guardian</EMPHASIS> of 8 April states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to Mr Armstrong, one of the main problems facing all the parties is the age and antiquity of the equipment at Cowra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although this factory has been profitable for Edgells for many years, no money was put back into upgrading the technology and equipment.</PARA>

<PARA>That is obviously the major point. The previous owners of that factory had done nothing at all to upgrade, to take advantage of accelerated depreciation on capital and plant. None of those things were done. We have people commiserating, feeling sorry and apportioning blame&mdash;I do not like to think they are apportioning blame. Instead of recognising the factors involved in the closure, we have mistruths, distortions and gross inaccuracies. That does absolutely nothing to help anybody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel very sad. I do not know how much editing was done on this story, but the quotes of the State Minister and the local shire president indicate that they either do not understand or a lot has been left on the cutting room floor.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the death in Vietnam last week of the Reverend Thich Don Hau. This matter has been brought to my attention by some in the Vietnamese community in Canberra. Reverend Thich Don Hau was a patriarch of the Buddhist church and his funeral was to have been held this Sunday. It was undoubtedly to have been a big event in Vietnam as he was a well-respected and well-known Buddhist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government of Vietnam has set up its own committee to arrange the funeral of Thich Don Hau. This has caused concern. The Government has rescheduled the service until Wednesday of next week. Apparently it has done this on the grounds that many years ago the monk was a member of parliament for a short time. I am told he had a seat in the parliament at that time only because he was virtually forced to do so by the government of the time. He subsequently resigned from parliament and returned to being a full time monk. I am told that he was quite outspoken about the government of that time and its attitude to human rights in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the supporters of the church here feel that the Government's intervention in setting up its own committee to arrange his funeral has less to do with honouring him for the work that he has done as a monk and more to do with attempting to make it appear that, as former member of the parliament, he was a supporter of the then government. The supporters feel that that is a distortion of the life of the man. They also feel that changing the funeral service from Sunday to Wednesday will significantly restrict the number of people who would be able to attend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seems to be some evidence to support their concerns. A number of senior monks in Vietnam have gone on a hunger strike against the government committee organising the funeral. I am told that initially the Government had said that it would not allow senior monks in prison to attend the service. However, there is some suggestion that it may allow this to occur. Honourable senators will remember that I have previously referred to the fact that Buddhist monks are still being held in prison in Vietnam and property of the Buddhist church being held by the Government has still not been returned to it. That is a pity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been approached and asked to raise this matter with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). I have been requested to ask him to make representations to the Vietnamese Government to allow the funeral of the patriarch Thich Don Hau to proceed in accordance with the wishes of members of the Buddhist church in Vietnam and not attempt to make it secular by organising it. This is undoubtedly a delicate matter. However, perhaps the Minister may be able to use his good offices with the Vietnamese Government. He has intervened previously and made representations on human rights concerns and on behalf of Buddhist monks who have been held in prison and sentenced to death&mdash;a matter I have referred to previously in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems a pity that something like a funeral cannot be organised in a way which is not divisive for the Buddhists who support the patriarch and which would allow them to honour him and his funeral service in the way that they would like. I ask the Minister on duty here tonight, the Minister for Shipping and Aviation (Senator Collins), to convey the matter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to see whether any appropriate representations might be made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a further issue regarding the ABC. Earlier today, the Senate was told about the absurdity of a decision of the Managing Director, David Hill, to have Mr George Manning and Mr Ian Haselby taken off air in Western Australia because they are standing for local government elections in Western Australia next Saturday. The decision involving Mr Manning was taken after a recent visit to Broome by Mr Hill when he met with the Broome community council, which protested about him being on air while Mr Manning is, as you would be aware, Madam Acting Deputy President, an apolitical and non-aligned local government candidate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Being a Western Australian, Madam Acting Deputy President, you would also be aware that local councillors are unpaid, yet this high-handed decision runs counter to the decision that was taken in the case of Mr Peter Holland when he stood for the 1984 Federal election for the Australian Labor Party. He was taken off air in Perth and relocated to the ABC in Bunbury. Bunbury just happens to be the major town in the electorate for which he had nominated. Where is the fairness in the ABC and why is the ABC denying these two gentlemen the right to serve the community in an unpaid capacity?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talking about fairness in the ABC, let me give another example of the illogical decision making process that it exercises. Mr Liam Bartlett, the local anchorman of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>, has submitted his resignation to the ABC and has given 16 weeks notice. Legal advice has stated that this is well within the terms of his contract. The ABC in Perth accepted Mr Bartlett's resignation only to have another high-handed decision made in Sydney which overturned the Perth management's decision. When will the ABC ever learn that Western Australia is capable of standing on its own two feet and making its own decisions? Quite frankly, I would be here all night if I were to relate all the decisions handed down from on high by the ABC in Sydney which take no account of Western Australian circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, Mr Bartlett no longer wishes to work for the ABC, yet it is demanding that he stay there until December or it will take him to court. I understand that Mr Bartlett has done an excellent job with the ABC, both as a reporter and an anchorman, and that he has lifted the ratings of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> to a very high level every single solitary night since he has been acting in those capacities. Congratulations go to him for doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when the country is broke, when the ABC budget has been cut by 20 per cent between 1985-86 and 1990-91 and when staffing has been reduced by 10 per cent between March 1990 and September 1991, why is the ABC prepared to waste taxpayers' money&mdash;and plenty of it&mdash;to keep someone who does not want to work there? In such a situation very little legal advice under $100,000 can be gained, yet Mr Hill is quite prepared to waste more taxpayers' money at a time when the tax burden is falling on fewer and fewer people due to the high unemployment policies of this Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Western Australian, I am sick and tired of taxpayer funded corporations such as the ABC not allowing local management to make decisions that are beneficial to Western Australia. Mr Bartlett fully knows and understands that he is under contract to the ABC. That is why he has sought to give four months&mdash;not four minutes&mdash;notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC in Perth has always struggled to get adequate funding for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>. It is purely city based at present. If the ABC has the money to throw away, why does it not give it to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> so that it can have the resources to cover the country areas? Surely, that would be a more wise use of the funds than taking an individual who no longer wishes to work for the ABC to court. I ask the Minister for Shipping and Aviation (Senator Collins) at the table: why will this Government allow the ABC to waste more taxpayers's money in fighting the inevitable?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take five minutes of the Senate's time tonight to place on record some of the activities of an organisation of which I have the pleasure to have been a member for several years&mdash;namely, the Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers, or ATCV as it is commonly known. The Trust is a non-profit community based organisation and it is completely non-political. By means of the considerable voluntary manpower latent in our community from which the Trust taps, it performs practical tasks to the benefit of the environment. The Trust runs on a high level of voluntary input&mdash;indeed, that is its essential ingredient&mdash;under the direction of employed field officers and a secretariat. The budget of the organisation is very small relative to its work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Environmental problems are the main focus of activity. The Trust has paid particular attention to salinity, soil erosion and the loss of native flora and fauna. The ATCV aims to assist local groups in management projects on public lands; to link the land-holder and the volunteer in conservation orientated projects; and to develop training programs which enable volunteers to acquire practical skills in ecological management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each ATCV team is a self-contained group. It is furnished with a vehicle, food and cooking facilities, hand tools and first aid equipment. The organisation has officers operating in Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales, Queensland, the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania. An office for Western Australia is planned for the near future and may well have opened by now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of all the community organisations&mdash;indeed, of all the organisations in Australia concerned with conservation and the environment&mdash;as I understand it, the Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers is the only example of an organisation running full time environment volunteers throughout the year on a national basis. The ATCV conducts projects during both weekends and weeks throughout the year. It is a major contributor of voluntary labour to farm, tree and land care groups and national parks and wildlife services in most States. The methodology for managing volunteers on a full time basis is based on having trained task force leaders in charge of groups of up to a maximum of 10 volunteers. These task groups have travelled the length and breadth of Australia to undertake projects. The success of the approach adopted by ATCV has led to a steady growth in community recognition and a significant increase in corporate support. The operations of ATCV provide a very sound basis on which to build a program to increase community participation voluntarily using a network of community groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ATCV is a unique conservation group in Australia. It is dedicated to practical conservation. The volunteers are working conservationists who consider themselves doers rather than talkers. It is for that reason that I have such a strong feeling of support for the organisation. It has done a great deal to encourage voluntarism in Australia, particularly in conservation and environmental matters. It has a small and very dedicated staff. Its executive director is Mr Colin Jackson; the national operations manager is Terry Peacock; the administrative assistant is Sandy Farley; and the bookkeeper, who is a very old friend of mine, is Mr Alf Bailey. That staff, together with other field staff who are stationed around Australia, run a very dedicated operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">True conservation activities in Australia will be successful only if they have a very wide spread of community support. Given the limited resources&mdash;particularly financial resources&mdash;of governments and organisations, that means a heavy reliance on voluntarism. Expert, trained volunteers are the key to the future of successful conservation in Australia. The ATCV is playing a very important role in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any organisation, even one which relies on volunteers as much as ATCV, needs sponsors. The organisation has been very fortunate in having strong, very supportive sponsors for several years. Sponsors include Yellow Pages, Shell Australia, Batesville Casket Company, SEC Victoria, Nissan Australia, Stihl Australia, Boral Cyclone, K-Mart, Alcoa Australia, STA Travel, the National Trust in the Northern Territory, the huge mining company of Western Mining, another major mining company Energy Resources Australia, Portland Aluminium Smelter, Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd, Greening Australia, Bus Australia and Queensland Cotton. All those sponsors are recognised in the 1991 annual report of the Trust. I commend those organisations for their sponsorship of what I believe is a very important organisation. It is a widely spread, community based organisation, and one which I hope will be built upon by those interested in proper conservation in Australia in future. It is of great concern and interest to all Australians to have an adequate and proper conservation movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far too often those movements have been heavily politically oriented. The great virtue of this organisation is that it is a doer and not a talker. It is not a political organisation. It has a very strong practical record. I look forward with great confidence to seeing the ATCV go forward in future on behalf of conservation generally, and for the benefit of all Australians. I commend all those who are presently concerned with the ATCV for the work they have already done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recommend those Australians who have not had much, if any, connection with the ATCV to look at that body and to see whether they can get behind it. We should seek to build on community effort in the preservation and conservation of our environment and many of those aspects of the Australian way of life that are so important to us all. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a great deal of comment about the Australian National Gallery building. It simply has not worked. It has been a disaster that has cost Australian taxpayers multi-millions of dollars. For example, its roof did not work; we had to spend $5m replacing it. That is just the beginning. One would think one of the basic requirements of a building is that it keeps the rain out. Apparently that is not a requirement with architects in Canberra these days, because that is not the only building that has had to cope with that problem. There seems to be a trend among architects these days that it does not matter what the purpose of the building is. The building is to be a monument to the architect, not a place in which functions actually occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This chamber is a place where talking goes on, yet the walls are clad with sound absorbent material so that there is  no reverberation. The only way you can be heard is with the support of artificial sound reinforcement. Any architect who designed this place for talking to take place knows nothing about talking. It is exactly the same with the Australian National Gallery. The architect who designed that building knows nothing about art and knows less about art galleries. It is a pathetic building. What intrigues me is that the original architect, Mr Madigan, is now complaining bitterly about the fact that this appalling building has been turned into quite a respectable art gallery because of major changes done by a very able architect, Mr Andersons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the points I would like to make emerge from a very interesting article written by Peter Cochrane of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. In that article, Mr Cochrane was incredibly kind to Mr Madigan, who is a partner in the Sydney firm of Edwards Madigan Torzillo Briggs, because he did not even mention the fact that the roof after only a few years has had to be totally replaced at public cost. Unfortunately, whoever was responsible&mdash;Mr Madigan has yet to establish, in my mind at least, that he did not play a major role in the roof not working&mdash;Mr Madigan or anybody else, is not capable of being sued for their incompetence. But Mr Cochrane reports that the major paintings in that gallery are now for the first time able to be displayed in sympathetic conditions. Colin Madigan, however, is complaining. The report quotes Mr Madigan as saying:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today he talks of the building refurbishments in terms of "betrayal" and "abandonment". "The new director and new council know nothing about . . . the sensitivities and sensibilities of architecture and design, and they've vandalised it.</PARA>
<PARA>All I can say to Mr Madigan is, `Good, it needed vandalising; it needed to be turned into an art gallery, not a monument'. Mr Madigan goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I am arguing&mdash;pleading&mdash;for a consciousness of what that building is all about. In architectural terms, it represented an image, an icon of that era, particularly the Whitlam years when Australia was, to some extent, in a stage of enlightenment.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is an icon to the Whitlam years, I guess it is appropriate. It cost too much, it did not work, and it has had to have been fixed up. So Madigan is right: it is an icon to the Whitlam years&mdash;an icon we can well and truly do without. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Madigan complains that Gallery 10&mdash;`a beautiful high-space gallery'&mdash;was cut in half to create the Nomura Court. I wish to say a couple of words about this lovely high space gallery. It was made of cement, of concrete, of off-form concrete which had not been shaken down the forms properly. It was full of holes. It was multi-coloured because of discolouration as a result of failure, I presume, of quality control. I will deal with that in a minute. Worse than that, the cement keeps flaking off this off-form concrete and damages the paintings. Apart from that, it is terrific! It is a great monument but a lousy art gallery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Architects do not seem to care much about people who actually use buildings. I would like to force the architect of this place to work for a year as a waitress in the members' dining room and carry full trays of food up and down the flight of seven stairs the waitresses have to negotiate because the architect thought it looked nice. But it is not terribly user-friendly. We have the same problem in this place. The architect goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my opinion, a gallery is supposed to act like a cathedral, to lift the spirits of the people . . . would they have added a mezzanine floor to St Paul's Cathedral?</PARA>
<PARA>What arrogant humbug! St Paul's Cathedral looks like a factory. This is no St Paul's Cathedral. It is an art gallery where people can have their spirits lifted by looking at the works of art. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The refurbishment of Galleries 2 and 3&mdash;the main contemporary art spaces&mdash;was undertaken without Madigan's co-operation.</PARA>
<PARA>Andrew Andersons was brought in to refurbish it. Betty Churcher, the Director of the Gallery, says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I couldn't get Col&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Madigan&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">back because he was too antagonistic to any suggestion of change, and he wouldn't argue from the point of view of the art, only from the point of view of the building.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, he could not care less that it was supposed to be an art gallery. Madigan believes that his design is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the antithesis of the `ad hockery' which now prevails . . . the visionless, small-minded, mundane, almost banal, approach to problem-solving.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Madigan's problem is his building and his design. If there is any problem-solving to emerge, it is because of what he did. Madigan goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fancy anyone in authority, sitting on the council, saying `We will divide Gallery 8 in half, we will put a mezzanine over the restaurant, we will close off the sky light to Gallery 2, we will put cardboard boxes around the walls of Galleries 1 and 3.</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose he is equally offended at the thought that we will put a new roof on to keep out the rain. The arrogance of architects knows no bounds. This lack of concern about function reminds me of a conversation I had the other day with Harry Seidler, who was protesting enormously about the inside of the Sydney Opera House's concert hall, saying how appalling it looks and that every architect who comes from overseas complains about what a disgraceful provincial interior there is to this brilliant and exciting shell outside. I said to him, `Harry, what does the music sound like inside it?'. It was almost a revolutionary concept that I should actually expect the concert hall to sound good and that I was concerned more about that than how it looked from the inside. He could not grasp the concept. That probably explains everything about architects' approach to buildings, particularly ones such as this. One of the main curators said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I've tried to hang these galleries&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, existing galleries in the National Gallery&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for 10 years, but the fact is they are at their best when there is nothing in them.</PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely correct. It was designed as a monument to the architect, not as a place to hang paintings. The gallery got the new architect, Andrew Andersons, to create spaces where paintings could be hung. According to Betty Churcher, his solution was absolutely inspired. I believe that is true. Mr Lloyd, one of the curators, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When you come in now you're still aware of the scale of the architecture, but you will not miss anything and you will not get lost. People were always getting lost before. Now, there's a strong access point and points of orientation along the way.</PARA>
<PARA>No wonder the original architect is complaining. People can actually use the gallery now without getting lost and can actually look at paintings. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Andersons wrote a letter to Madigan, describing his approach to the refurbishment; Madigan replied "indirectly".</PARA>
<PARA>Andersons said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He's understandably upset that his building is being modified, as any architect would be. I think that the ANG was probably the most important project in Col's career.</PARA>
<PARA>All I can say is that I hope something better happens in his career, because if that was his top point, I would hate to see his bottom point. The simple fact is that the previous configuration simply did not meet the users' needs. How many times have we heard that sort of thing in architecture?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major problems facing the Australian National Gallery was not only that the art was dominated, or diminished, by the architecture but also that the bush-hammered concrete walls shed dust, which threatened to damage paintings, and the lighting was a major headache. Mr Lloyd said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The walls shed a particularly nasty, corrosive concrete dust with a high alkalinity content which reacts badly with heavy pigments such as cadmium and lead white, which are not uncommon in artworks. . . A chemical reaction is set up so that if you are not careful it can alter the original pigment. Recently, we vacuumed all the triagrid ceilings, prior to painting the galleries once they had been clad, and the amount of concrete dust sucked up was horrific.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to whether any measurable damage has been done to the paintings, I don't think our conservation department would be prepared to say. Some dust did get into the textiles in the Asian gallery next door. It threw the curators into a panic, and they spent some months getting it out.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Madigan countered that by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . probably the result of building work carried out recently when, in effect, Gallery 8 was destroyed. . . as part of a roofing contract.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Madigan, the architect, was not prepared to tell the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> that a `roofing contract' meant replacing the roof that his design and his builders were not capable of doing in such a way that it kept out the rain. As I understand, rain is supposed to be kept off paintings in an art gallery. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In covering the bush-hammered walls of Galleries 1, 2 and 3 with plasterboard, Betty&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Betty Churcher&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has destroyed the cohesion of the building, from inside to outside.</PARA>
<PARA>If he wanted a cohesive building, would it not have been a nice idea if he had designed one to be an art gallery? Now it is one, and I am glad. Let us look at the sort of user unfriendly proposition that emerges when we give architects free reign to design monuments themselves. Mr Lloyd said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lighting is attached to the so-called space-frame ceiling. The only way we can access those lights is with a movable platform on which is mounted a cherry picker. In here&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, in the gallery&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">we have to push it around between the sculpture and the showcases. It can take an hour to change a light bulb in Galleries 2 or 3, involving at least three people, and it becomes a screaming match between the curator on the floor and the electrician above. The electrician can't actually see the picture, so the curator has to yell at him: `Move it a bit to the right, or to the left.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Imagine trying to throw a framed beam of light from a 15-metre high ceiling, at an angle, on to a Cezanne that is 30cm x 25cm. That's a terrific achievement&mdash;we can do it, but it means that the light, once the shutters are locked into place, must not move. A millimetre of movement in the shutters would magnify over that distance into centimetres and you get this big blue shadow moving across the picture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The air-conditioning ducts are also located in the ceiling, and so you get constant low-level vibration. Over a period of time all the shutters would shift. It's like painting the Sydney Harbour Bridge&mdash;you get to one end of the gallery and have to start again, realigning the lights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Churcher adds a fourth concern: "The concrete walls and the floor are light-absorbent, which doesn't help maintain the vitality of the light coming from way up above.</PARA>
<PARA>Having seen the Rubens exhibition, Senator Collins would have noted that the art gallery authorities have very sensibly lined that area with a deep red, which is a brilliant backdrop to the paintings. </PARA>

<PARA>So at last we have a situation where a disastrous building has been converted&mdash;at enormous expense, by the way, in terms of the roof, but at modest expense in terms of the rest&mdash;into what I hope will be regarded as a most satisfactory art gallery. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. Flight paths at Brisbane have been developed with a view to minimising residents' exposure to aircraft noise, including two recent flight path modifications for this purpose. The noise problem at Brisbane cannot be considered acute when compared with the level of aircraft noise at other major Australian cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No. However, under certain weather conditions aircraft are required to use the Instrument Landing System (ILS) for approach to runway 01 at Brisbane Airport, rather than visual approach, commencing descent at a height of 3000 feet at Archerfield. Noise abatement procedures in place at Brisbane Airport ensure, as far as practicable, that distress and discomfort to residents is minimised. In this regard, over 90% of aircraft operating during the hours between 10.00pm and 6.00am land from the north over Moreton Bay</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Brisbane Airport Task Force, which reported in June 1991, found that since the new Brisbane Airport opened in March 1988 the total noise impact on residential areas has been reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Brisbane Airport has been designed to cope with increased traffic operations. The problem of aircraft noise emissions will continue to be dealt with through noise abatement procedures in place at the Airport. In addition, the Government has regulated to phase out older and noisier subsonic jet aircraft by the year 2002. The phasing out of these aircraft should minimise aircraft noise pollution in Australia in the medium to long term.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Minister for Land Transport approved on 12 March 1990 $21.2 million for the preconstruction work required for the reconstruction and widening of 5.6km of the Albany Highway between Oats Street East Victoria Park and William Street Beckenham.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Federal Government determines how funds are spent on proposals submitted by the States.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Main Roads Department Western Australia has examined the possibility of modifying this footbridge and two proposals are currently being considered.

The second proposal is the provision of hydraulic lifts at either end of the existing footbridge. This would greatly improve accessibility, for senior citizens and the disabled. Preliminary indications are that glass walled lifts can be provided which would reduce concerns about the security of users. The estimated cost of installation of these lifts is $0.6m.

Signs were required to be erected at the commencement of construction and maintained for the life of the Federal program or for at least one year after the opening of the project to traffic. Details of arrangements made by States for producing these signs as well as the numbers erected and cost of signs have been included in the overall cost of road projects and are not separately available. </PARA>
