<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Australian National University Act 1991 to ensure that the Council of the University is solely responsible for the application of money appropriated by the Parliament for the purposes of the University and for the management of the University.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian National University is established by an Act of Parliament which specifies that there will be a research school in the field of medical science and that it is to be known as the John Curtin School of Medical Research. It also states that the Australian National University Council should have the entire control and management of the University.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any attempt to actually separate these powers of management and control from the ANU Council would certainly be against the spirit of the Act. Any attempt to do this without the full knowledge of the Parliament is an attempt to circumvent the will of the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet this is what the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) has attempted to do. This Bill that I have introduced is structured to prevent this blatant abuse of Ministerial power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the arrangements as intended by the ANU Act 1991, the Australian National University receives its funding from the Department of Education, Employment and Training and then distributes it accordingly. This preserves the autonomy of the University and the integrity of the John Curtin School of Medical Research, as was originally intended by the founders of the ANU.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Baldwin plan, the John Curtin School will be singled out and funding responsibilities transferred to the Department of Health. Thus the Department will be able to determine the funding levels for the School, and will be able to influence the research profile of the School. The Department may very well decide that the School's activities should be wound down. Research in Australia has already suffered enough through the machinations of the Australian Research Council and the education profile process. Handing the funding for the John Curtin School over to the Department of Health is paving the way for even more centrally-determined research priorities. This stifles research, particularly that research in which the John Curtin School excels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There needs to be a plurality of effort and funding in research. In this way money is provided for a variety of projects, including pure and applied research. This allows expansion into different fields that may produce a variety of benefits. Centrally-funded research leads to a blinkered vision of where research should be heading.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is this invasion of the autonomy of a university that must be prevented. Government interference with and intervention in higher education institutions have been both disruptive and destructive. We now have a bureaucratically administered system dominated by ministerial discretion. Independence of the education system has had to make way for bureaucratic favours while the Government enforces policy with the threat of withholding funds. Now this ruinous policy has gone as far as threatening the John Curtin School of Medical Research.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The John Curtin School of Medical Research is a world class biomedical research institute. Its greatest strength is that it nurtures and tolerates long-term research on a diverse range of problems. It is one of the few institutions left that still continues this research&mdash;research which is not politically motivated but which ultimately yields the most beneficial results.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The John Curtin School of Medical Research is part of the Institute of Advanced Studies within the ANU. The Institute is an entity that consists of various research schools which interact with each other. It is that interaction that is very important. The burgeoning areas of science are the interdisciplinary areas. The interaction between the various research schools is therefore becoming increasingly important in joint projects. If these corporate ventures are to succeed then it is essential that the John Curtin School be a full corporate member of the Institute and not be separately funded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The unique qualities of the John Curtin School should be treasured and nurtured. It is through institutions such as the School that Australia can stay at the cutting edge of scientific advancement. The John Curtin School was not established to be just another arm of government policy. This was clearly not the wish of its founders, who include such eminent Australians as Sir Howard Florey, Sir Mark Oliphant and Dr H.C. Coombs. The latter two have objected strenuously and publicly to the proposed changes. The Government has tried to gain control of the School by circumventing the authority of the Parliament through manipulating the ANU into delegating its powers. This cannot be allowed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister's actions in relation to the John Curtin School of Medical Research have put all Australian universities on notice that the Federal Government will not hesitate to intervene at any level in their internal affairs. We cannot allow the Government to continue this interference in our higher education institutions. The Government has inflicted its policy on the ANU and the School against the wishes of almost all concerned. These actions must be rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill I present for the Senate's consideration today will ensure that funding for the John Curtin School, or for any other section of the University, stays under the control of the University. It will also ensure that the Minister is unable to abridge the autonomy of the University where it is provided for in the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The John Curtin School of Medical Research must remain under the auspices of the ANU as has always been intended. Taking the responsibility for funding the School away from the University and giving it to the Department of Health will compromise its independence and detrimentally effect the world-class work being undertaken there.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This action by the Government will also set a worrying precedent for intervention in our other institutions of higher education. Once the Government feels that it can get away with this invasion of the autonomy of a university they could undermine other universities in a similar way, changing the education profiles of the various institutions. This would be detrimental to the development of the knowledge and expertise that will be essential if Australia is to have any future in a competitive internationalised world marketplace.</PARA>

<PARA>Clearly, that part of the motion which relates to the first sitting day in March 1992 is inappropriate and, therefore, I may seek leave to amend the motion to state the first sitting day in May 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue to be referred is a very important issue, going to the integrity of the briefing of the delegation&mdash;not to the integrity of the delegation itself. Clearly, the ability of any delegation such as this to question Chinese officials about violations of human rights depends very largely upon the advice and briefings that it has been given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee should not take a great deal of time on the reference because it is clearly asked to do certain things; that is, to ask why the delegation was not provided with adequate information and briefing on the gross and continuing violations of human rights inherent in China's population control program which would have enabled the delegation to challenge the assurances which were given by the Chinese officials and which it repeated in the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to page 47 of the report in which the assurances given to the delegation by the Chinese officials are repeated&mdash;that is, that compulsory abortion and compulsory sterilisation are strictly proscribed and contrary to policy; and that abortion is recommended only if contraception fails, but that abortion was never mandatory even in those cases. It should be remembered that this assurance was given by officials in the Sichuan province. I will show shortly that, in fact, the family planning regulations of the Sichuan province not only do not proscribe compulsory abortions but in certain circumstances and for certain women they prescribe&mdash;actually make compulsory&mdash;abortion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also on pages 47 and 48 gives credence to the alleged policy that abortion is never mandatory. Clearly, that is not a fact and there is ample evidence to state that that is not a fact. The delegation, it appears, did have the Sichuan province family planning regulations. Annex 8 of the delegations's report quotes part of the Sichuan People's Congress regulations on Sichuan family planning. This was included for another purpose. But the delegation must have had the regulations. That being the case, why did it not ask the Chinese officials about certain articles of those very regulations which relate to coercion in matters of abortion and sterilisation? I will refer to some of those matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Article 13 states that couples who have inherited metal illness, mental deficiency, deformity or serious inherited diseases are forbidden to have children; and if pregnant, according to the regulations the pregnancy should be terminated. It is very noticeable that the eugenics program of the regime in China is nearing, if not surpassing, that of the Hitler regime. That must be of great concern to people in this chamber and, of course, to anyone who is interested in maintaining the universality of human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Article 14 states that either husband or wife should adopt sterilisation measures after they have two children. Article 23 states that those who refuse education and give birth to children not covered by the plan will be fined from the month the child is born. Regarding pregnancy not covered by the plan, the article states that `both upon the husband and wife there will be imposed a fine of 20 to 31 a month during the period of pregnancy. If the pregnancy is terminated, the fine imposed will be returned'. Article 27 states that illegal removal of IUDs is prohibited. That is the Sichuan province regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My motion goes on to ask the Committee to ask the delegation whether at any stage it was provided with a true copy of the family planning regulations for the Sichuan Province. Apparently the delegation had a copy, but presumably it was not a full and true copy, otherwise it would have been able to ask the Chinese officials about the regulations mandating abortion. The motion goes on to request the Committee to ask whether the attention of the delegation was drawn to the specific articles in those regulations which make it mandatory for particular women to submit to compulsory abortions and sterilisations and which make the unauthorised removal of an IUD an offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the motion requests the Committee to ascertain why the report failed to make reference to these provisions which legally entrench violations of human rights while including certain articles from the same regulations for the purpose of setting out exemptions for the one child per couple family planning regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sichuan Province regulations are not isolated. It may be said that I am just quoting from regulations which are in force in the Sichuan Province and ignoring what occurs in other places. That is not the case. Let me suggest that it would be illuminating to find out what is in operation in other provinces. Just to give the Senate an example, I will deal with those regulations adopted for Henan in April 1990. We are not talking about 10 years ago; we are talking about current measures that are being enforced in China. Those regulations adopted for Henan in April 1990 leave little doubt as to their purpose. Here are a few of the provisions from articles 3, 4, 11, 22 and 24 which state:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Husbands and wives must carry out the duty of practising family planning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To pursue family planning, we must persist in the practice of focusing our main efforts on propaganda and education. In the meantime, necessary measures must be adopted to strengthen management in accordance with law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Childbirths must be placed under the guidance of the state and carried out in a planned way. The practice of each couple having one child only must be advocated and encouraged. Birth of a second child must be strictly controlled, and the birth of a third child must be prohibited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Couples who have suffered from serious hereditary diseases including mental disease, hereditary mental incapability, hereditary deformity, and so on are strictly prohibited from having children. . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. . . a woman of childbearing age who has had one child must use an IUD. If a couple of childbearing age have had two or more children, either the husband or the wife must be sterilised. . . . in case a woman becomes pregnant without permission under the state plan, remedial measures must be taken to terminate the pregnancy.</PARA>
<PARA>That clearly demonstrates the coercive measures contained in the law. I could cite further provinces. For example, in September 1991 Guangdong Province reported that its Vice-Governor had signed an emergency circular demanding that all areas push forward a full drive to promote the family planning then reaching its full climax. I quote from a transcript of Guangdong radio, the Guangdong Provincial Service:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By 20 September 1991, a total of 309,000 persons have undergone [one or another] of the four types of operations required by family planning [i.e., IUD insertion, vasectomy, tubal ligation and abortion], up 43 per cent over the same period last year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The circular called on all localities to take effective measures to ensure that the task of subjecting the appropriate people to any one of the four kinds of operations for 1991 was fulfilled. It said that the climax should be maintained until the task is fulfilled, which should considerably increase the number of two-girl households who are willing to accept the ligation operation, and see to it that women who are about to have additional births have induced abortions.</PARA>
<PARA>That was broadcast on Guangdong radio on 24 September 1991, two weeks after the human rights delegation that went to China tabled its report in this Parliament. The Chinese family planning officials would be laughing at that part of the report that says that the delegation that went to China was assured that these sorts of violations of human rights did not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on for quite a long time about the history of the matter but I am trying to keep it short. Here we are with material that is right up to date. If the Senate Standing Committee is interested in this matter&mdash;and I am sure it is interested in the question of human rights&mdash;then these human rights violations should be examined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have just quoted from a circular issued by the Guangdong Province Vice-Governor in September 1991. I remind honourable senators of what was said: We should considerably increase the number of two-girl households who are willing to accept the ligation operation and see to it that women who are about to have additional births have induced abortions. Now, how do the Chinese go about that&mdash;leaving aside for the moment what is contained in the law?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chinese family planning cadres go about it in the most ruthless manner. Not only is there direct coercion, by measures that are described in a number of authoritative works, but also there are measures that are coercive in their effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Those direct measures, as I indicated, have been described on a number of occasions by authoritative persons, and also, of course, by the press. I note that on 11 September 1991, just two days after the China delegation gave its report to the Senate, there was an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">London Independent</EMPHASIS> titled `China's wanted children', and subtitled `They come for unborn babies in the dead of night'. This report was from a Chinese citizen who detailed the brutal population control attempts that take place in China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did mention that there are measures which are coercive in their effect and measures which leave little choice but for the women to submit to coercion. Those include penalising whole communities because of the birth of an unauthorised child or because a woman is pregnant with an unauthorised child&mdash;penalising workers for the same reason, with certain targets given for workplaces. No person, much less a person with a Labor background, should countenance that sort of anti-worker attitude. I think we are entitled to examine this further so that not only human rights are upheld and maintained but also the rights of individual workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give an example of some of the measures which are coercive in their effects, heavy financial penalties are regularly imposed on individuals. They are forbidding penalties which push the couple even further into abject poverty. Whole groups and whole communities are affected by the penalties. For example, in September 1988 Liaoning Province instituted certain measures. In order to qualify for second births to daughter only families, villages had to meet six conditions, among which were the elimination of all unauthorised births, adoption of birth control by all women of child bearing age and the establishment of an effective system of population control. It was said that 80 per cent of Liaoning's villages were able to qualify but they could lose their eligibility at any time. If there are unplanned pregnancies, quotas for second births will not be issued to the village in question until remedial measures are adopted. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If unplanned births are found, quotas for second births will be suspended for one year, starting with the month in question. Quotas will be re-issued only after effective adjustment. That means only after the individuals are coerced into having abortions, otherwise other families cannot have children. If that is not a measure with coercive effects, I do not know the meaning of the word `coercion'. Maybe there are attempts to redefine the meaning of the word `coercion' and the words `human rights'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe passage of this motion is important so that we in the Senate are able to ascertain why there was not the appropriate briefing. I am not pointing the bone at the human rights section of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade necessarily, although I believe it should have been its role to give adequate briefing. In this particular aspect of violations of human rights it seems to have given the matter over to certain sections of AIDAB, which sections have a vested interest in the diversion of Australian money into population control programs. I do not think that is an adequate way to deal with violations of human rights&mdash;that is another argument, of course; we can have that argument at any time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is important that we pass this motion not only for that reason but also because at some stage the people of China, who are suffering under this regime's dictatorial measures which violate their human rights, will rise up against their masters. They will be the ones, ultimately, who will be the leaders of China. They will be the ones who will recall what Australia did or did not do to protect their human rights when they were under threat, when those human rights were being trampled upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for Australia that we look clearly at the facts. Where else can we look at them? I cannot think of any other way of doing it but to ensure that this motion is sent to the Committee so that information can be obtained from those responsible for briefing the delegation as to why certain things did not occur, why the whole truth was not available to the delegation before it went, why the questions were not asked of the appropriate officials in China, why the report simply mentioned the assurances of the Chinese officials, and why the report gave credence to the alleged policy that abortion in China is never mandatory when clearly the opposite is the case. There is an abundance of evidence from Chinese sources which shows that the opposite is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the Chinese officials say one thing to representatives from the outside world but another  thing to the people of China about this area of population control. I have a number of important up to date quotes, which times does not permit me to read now, from Chinese radio and Chinese press urging the population to accept control measures and threatening them with dire consequences if they do not. We know that these dire consequences result. I believe it is important, for the reasons I have just enumerated, that we refer this matter to the Committee for examination and report to the Senate. I hope the motion is carried. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports this reference going to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. The principle that is referred to here, and to which Senator Harradine has referred a number of times in his half hour speech and at other times over recent years, is that it would be contrary to the views of every member of this Senate to see forced abortions as the practice in any country and for forced abortions to be enshrined in any regulation or law. The allegation is that this is not entirely clear and that this is a matter which could have been pursued by the delegation, which included three members of parliament, two from this chamber, that went to China in July last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where the Opposition draws back from the wording of Senator Harradine's motion referring this matter to the Committee is in paragraph (a)&mdash;`why the delegation was not provided', which answers the question before the question is asked. We would rather have had words such as `whether the delegation was or was not provided', making it less prejudiced and less like the giving of an answer before the question is considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly in paragraph (b) we draw back from the words `whether the delegation at any stage was provided with a true copy', which calls into question, some would read, the bona fides of the delegation, as if it were possible that our colleagues on this delegation from the Senate may have been given a true copy but did not disclose it in their report. Any such implication, I think, would be unintended by Senator Harradine but again, we do not accept any allegation of less than a bona fide approach by the members of the delegation that went from Australia to China in July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph (c) of Senator Harradine's motion refers to `provisions which legally entrench violations of human rights'. This calls into question whether China, nationally or in any of its provinces, including the province of Sichuan, has laws which `entrench violations of human rights'. I have visited Sichuan a number of times. I do not claim to be an expert on the law of Sichuan, but having heard Senator Harradine this last half hour, I still would be surprised if there were in the law of Sichuan province such an entrenching of a practice that violates human rights in the way that is espoused&mdash;that is, a law that required the abortion of a child. I would even ask whether the law was permissive in this matter. I sincerely doubt whether there is such an offence in the law of Sichuan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, whilst the Opposition supports Senator Harradine's reference of this matter to the Committee, of which I happen to be the Deputy Chairman, on behalf of the Opposition I indicate that we draw back from some of the wording of the motion, in particular in the three instances that I have referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me underline very clearly on behalf of the Opposition that we are opposed to forced abortion in any country at any time. It is as offensive to us as murder, rape or any other crimes that are recognised in this country as crimes and which are in most countries recognised as crimes. I believe that forced abortion is against the principles of human rights conventions agreed to in the United Nations to which Australia and many other countries are signatories. Certainly it would be triply offensive if such a practice were in any way sanctioned or enforced by any law of a province or state. It is my view that this is not the case in China. It may be a practice that is carried out unlawfully. It may even be a prevalent practice in certain provinces carried out unlawfully. I have certainly heard of such incidents. I have the same abhorrence of those incidents as I think every senator in this chamber would have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to refer to one other matter. In the conduct of this inquiry I see that the thrust is to ask representatives of the delegation what degree of information they may have received and why they did not receive fuller information about this matter. Another obvious witness would be a representative from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. We should ask why that Department did not take an initiative, or to what extent it did take an initiative, to brief the delegation prior to its departure from Australia. The inquiry into the delegation and the Department should be without prejudice; it should be seeking to know factually what information was available; and, regarding paragraph (c), should find out what the delegation found while it was in China&mdash;what evidence was sought, what evidence was discovered and whether it is in addition to anything that is in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reference does not actually envisage the Senate Committee conducting an inquiry involving China's Mission in Canberra or its Ambassador, or trying to ascertain from Australia what the situation may be in China. I am sure we would be assisted if the Chinese Ambassador wanted to put out a statement as to what the national law of China was, what the province of Sichuan's law was or what was practice, because these matters are referred to in this motion but I emphasise that the thrust of this inquiry is within Australia into the delegation, the Department and any other relevant body that could have informed the delegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I was travelling back from Europe to Beijing in early October&mdash;just before I visited China for the third time in the last 15 months&mdash;I read very carefully the whole of the delegation's report. As the Senate knows, the delegation was led by Senator Schacht. Its deputy leader was my Liberal colleague Mr Connolly from the House of Representatives. Senator Bourne from the Australian Democrats and other academics and public officials from Australia were also part of the delegation. The delegation visited China in July 1991 and its report was made public by the Minister in, I think, September 1991. I am very grateful to those who got that to me in Moscow when I was coming back from representing this Parliament when visiting European parliamentary and government institutions. It was possible for me to read the report fully when travelling between Moscow and Beijing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happen to believe that it is a very useful report. It is one that I regard as having advanced Australia's concerns and advanced them in a way that they can be effective. We need to be sensitive to the culture and sovereignty of any country when we start to make statements about our concerns about that country's behaviour and practices. The offence to everyone in this chamber of the events of June 1989 with the deaths in and around Tiananmen Square was a matter that was obviously very much a part of this delegation's visit to China. Another matter was the concerns expressed for the full citizenship rights and human rights of the peoples of Tibet within China and of various outspoken political movements and representatives, including those with minority views in China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these three priority areas of discussion by the delegation with representatives of China a great deal of information was gained, a great deal of constructive discussion was undertaken, and the report has been a very useful one. When I went to China in October I was able to meet the Assistant Foreign Minister, Liu Huaqiu, the same man who on behalf of China opened the new and quite magnificent Chinese Embassy here in Canberra. I have met with Mr Liu Huaqui a number of times and the Australian Ambassador, Michael Lightowler, accompanied me in my discussions with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention one aspect only of our discussion and that is my reference to the human rights delegation of Australia and the report. The Minister agreed with me that it was a constructive visit and a constructive report and he welcomed a second visit. On behalf of the Government of China, he saw that it was an important part of the increasingly constructive relationship between Australia and China to progress this whole agenda with a second visit and possibly subsequent visits, and to build upon in a new way the work of the delegation in the first report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to encourage the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, to facilitate and to make arrangements for a second visit to China. It is with that in mind that this reference of a matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade by Senator Harradine can very constructively be undertaken by the Committee, fully taking into account any factual matters that Senator Harradine and others can bring before the Committee but without prejudice so that the second delegation can with more information and soundness clarify the remaining areas of issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by noting that whilst it was agreed that the date for reporting be 4 May&mdash;and I gave that date off the top of my head&mdash;the wording of the motion at the moment is: `report by the first sitting day in March'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Harradine reads the report carefully he will discover that the three paragraphs which he finds offensive&mdash;in this 83-page report&mdash;all begin with qualifying statements such as, `The Delegation was told that. . . '. We were told these things. It does not say that we agreed that these things were the case. We said, `This policy . . . appeared to be confirmed . . . '. It appeared to be. We did not say, `It was confirmed'; we said that it appeared to be confirmed. We said, `The Delegation was assured that. . . '. The delegation was assured. That does not mean that the delegation agreed. We end with a qualifying statement to these three paragraphs, and that qualifying statement is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Delegation was unable to assess whether this was the case in practice.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is not enough for Senator Harradine and if he thinks that that gives credence to these things, I am sorry, it does not. That was not the impression that was meant to be given by this report and I do not believe that it is the impression that was given by this report. The delegation was very careful to qualify all statements it made on any subject in this report where we did not have any hard physical evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In part (b) of the motion Senator Harradine asks:</PARA>

<PARA>I can tell Senator Harradine now that the delegation was given a copy of Sichuan Province family planning regulations. It is a 150-page document. It was in Chinese. We asked specifically for one small piece to be translated for us before we left the country, and that was the piece on the one-child policy, because we found that particularly interesting and it had a lot of information in it that we did not know beforehand; we had been given it in one briefing. We got that translated towards the end of our visit. We brought the 150-page document back. It is 150 pages; it has not all been translated. There is no reference in this report to us agreeing to what is in those regulations. There is one article in that 150-page set of regulations, article 13, which states that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">couples who have inherited mental illness, mental deficiency, deformity or serious inherited diseases are forbidden to have children. If pregnant, according to the regulation, the pregnancy should be terminated.</PARA>
<PARA>This is our English translation. The article means several different things in several different translations. Senator Harradine will understand that different translations mean different things. If we take the Bible, for example, it can mean completely different things depending on whether it has been translated by one person or another. It is the same with translation from other languages. The Chinese wording of this regulation is open to different interpretations, one of which could imply that abortion is mandatory in these circumstances. That is the only possible reference that we could find in these regulations to mandatory abortion. </PARA>

I am sure everyone will agree that Laogai, Laojiao, the situation in Tibet, torture, prison conditions, household registration, freedom of religion, capital punishment, freedom of assembly, counter-revolutionary crimes, party control, the court systems, the militia and the work of the People's Liberation Army are also important aspects of China's human rights framework and of Australia's relations with China in relation to human rights. If we start looking into everything that is in this report, undoubtedly there are details of these aspects to which no reference was made in the report. That will happen. It is only an 83-page report; we were there for three weeks. What the delegation attempted to provide in the report was an overview of the human rights situation in China, particularly in relation to formal and constitutional rights, the Chinese legal, judicial and penal systems, and how laws and policies are observed and implemented in practice, particularly in relation to the protection of the rights of individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats do not believe that the report even has the shortcomings described by Senator Harradine in his motion; nor are we convinced that the failure of the report to refer to one small section in a 150-page set of regulations from one of the provinces of China is sufficient reason to devote a great deal of the valuable time and effort of a Senate committee, and a large slab of taxpayers' money, to a Senate investigation. </PARA>

A great deal of information was given to us before we left.

I point out at the outset that the Australian Government does not support coercive or mandatory abortion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion attempts to refer a matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. In fact, the matter relates to a report produced by a parliamentary and community delegation which visited China in July last year. I understand that several members of the Federal Parliament, including Senator Schacht and Senator Bourne, were in that delegation. I also understand that Mr David Connolly from the House of Representatives was the third parliamentary member of that delegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that not one of those persons is a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. They were all on that delegation in their capacities as members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I think I am correct in saying that all of them are members of the joint standing committee, which comprises members of this chamber and the House of Representatives, not the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, this motion proposes to refer for investigation a matter relating to the report of a joint standing committee to another committee. I find that a rather novel idea, particularly as the Committee to which the reference is intended to go has no expertise in this matter and none of the members of that Committee were members of the delegation. I certainly can say on behalf of myself and, I am sure, on behalf of other members of the Committee, with perhaps the exception of Senator Teague, that the members have not looked at the detailed content of the report on China of the human rights delegation, although we are certainly aware of the overview given by that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can say that my Committee, like other Senate standing committees, has a very busy work schedule. It has an onerous work program. Of course, the committee members' time is valuable. We are already in March facing the 30 April deadline for our report on Australia's relationship with Latin America. This major inquiry which has been looking at our trade, transport, investment and cultural links with Latin America has been conducted by the Senate Standing Committee since last year. Over 100 written submissions have been received as evidence. Much evidence has been collected from around Australia. The inquiry has been characterised by path breaking evidence from the diplomatic community in Canberra. A number of ambassadors from the Latin American countries have come forward to give very important evidence to this Committee. That is quite an unprecedented step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deadline for the report of the Committee has already has been extended once. Originally the Committee was to report at an earlier date. That deadline was extended to 30 April by resolution of the Senate to enable the Committee to collect further important evidence, including evidence which will be forthcoming from the ambassadors for both Colombia and Peru. They will be appearing shortly before the Committee to help the Committee upgrade its evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Latin American inquiry was inaugurated, the Senate has referred an extra matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I refer to the resolution of the Senate passed as recently as 8 May last year which referred a further matter to the Committee for report; that is, the adequacy with which Australia's policy and guidelines for controlling military transfers safeguard Australia's defence, security and national relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So even though we have not yet completed our major report on Australia's trading and transport links with Latin America, another reference has been given to the Committee. I might point out that that inquiry has not yet begun; nothing has been done at this stage about that subsequent reference. Yet, here we are today debating a motion to give the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade another reference. Another reference is being proposed today although consideration of a reference referred to the Committee 10 months ago on 8 May 1991 has not even been commenced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would be aware in your capacity as Deputy Chair of the Standing Committee, the Committee's members also have their own personal interests and priorities for inquiry. They have matters that they would like to look into. Mr Acting Deputy President, I know that you have stated your view here this morning, but other members of the Committee have priorities for investigation. Some of my colleagues on the Committee regard it as a matter of urgency that we look into Australia's economic relationship with South East Asia. A number of members of the Committee have stressed as a priority that Australia really must look to upgrade its economic linkages in South East Asia to match the stronger political linkages that have been developed in recent decades. That is certainly a subject dear to the hearts of some members of my Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I would point out that this Committee has a busy work program. It would not be easy to fit another reference, another inquiry, into the work program of the Committee. On that basis, I ask that the motion be rejected by the Senate. </PARA>

We also share very grave concerns about the substantive issues that he has raised. As has been said earlier by you, Mr Acting Deputy President, on behalf of the coalition, nobody on this side of the chamber is willing to tolerate forced abortions and conduct of a similar nature.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter is of major significance to our relationship with China. In particular, I note that when this delegation was first proposed and was given the imprimatur of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, it was intended that it would establish certain facts and form the basis for assessing the future direction of our relationship with China. If there has been a flaw in the briefings that the delegation was given prior to departing this country, or if they were of an unsatisfactory nature, then they are matters that it is right, fitting and proper for the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to inquire into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not accept the argument brought before the chamber today by Senator Maguire that the Committee is very busy and that this matter is not of sufficient importance. A lot of Senate committees are very busy, but this matter is of importance. If the fundamental premises upon which this delegation left the country were flawed, then of course that bears major implications in connection with, firstly, the conduct of our relations with China and, secondly, the adequacy and the conduct of certain units within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. In saying that, I do not cast any aspersion upon that Department. I merely say that it is fitting, proper and appropriate for the Senate and for the Parliament to oversee the operations of government departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also very concerned, on behalf of the Chinese community in this country, that there is a proper and adequate understanding of our relationship with China. If there are flaws in the briefings that were provided to this delegation before it left, then obviously it means that the delegation would have been clearly unable to adequately fulfil the task which we asked it to perform, namely, to inquire into these alleged human rights violations in China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that all of these matters are of grave concern to Australia's Chinese community for the very simple reason that for the Chinese community in this country family has a particular significance beyond a simple kinship arrangement, beyond the desire of individual parents to have children. Family is the basis of Chinese culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is shown that the briefings that were received by the delegation prior to leaving Australia were inadequate and that as a result certain matters relating to those very fundamental human rights, which every nation recognises, but most particularly to those cultural values which the Chinese community in this country still holds very dear, then I believe that the matter should be inquired into by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appeared today that Senator Bourne was a little upset in that she thought Senator Harradine was casting aspersions on members of the delegation. I know Senator Harradine very well and I know very well his motives for seeking this inquiry. I do not believe that Senator Harradine was casting aspersions on the delegation but merely saying that this matter is one of major significance. The proper conduct of the Department is a fitting area for the Senate Standing Committee to inquire into and, therefore, Senator Harradine has moved to refer this matter to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These matters having been raised&mdash;and they are important matters of human rights to which this chamber should not just pay lip service but should pay due duty&mdash;it would be remiss of this chamber to now turn its back on the reference which Senator Harradine has moved today. To do so would give a clear signal to the rest of the world that we are not fair dinkum on international human rights. I would be gravely disappointed&mdash;it would be a slur on the integrity of this chamber&mdash;if this matter was not sent off even for one day's inquiry; that people's personal preferences for what they might like this Committee to do are more important than one day's inquiry into the adequate conduct of the briefings the delegation received and, moreover, human rights in China. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had the translation for some time, and clearly that makes abortion and sterilisation mandatory. The delegation was unable to ask Chinese officials to back up their assurances. Senator Bourne says, `If you look at the paragraphs in the report, you will see that they are qualified'. There are phrases such as `The delegation raised allegations that compulsory abortion and compulsory sterilisation were used to enforce the one child policy'. The report said that the delegation was assured by Chinese officials that these practices `were strictly proscribed and contrary to policy'. If those concerned had the Sichuan Province regulations in Chinese, why did they not get the whole of those regulations translated into English so that they could have challenged that statement? They did not do so and they have just reported here to us that they were assured of these things by Chinese officials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report went on further to say that the policy towards abortion appeared to be confirmed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have quoted from up to date sources, including internal radio and newspaper reports&mdash;reports that the people of China hear and read.

Let us make no mistake about it, there are systematic violations of human rights which the Chinese people are burdened with. They will rise up on some occasion and the people who have attempted to whitewash those violations of human rights will be targeted. The anger of the Chinese people will be vented upon them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for us all to realise, and particularly Senator Teague, who is the Chair of the Australia-China Parliamentary Friendship Group, that the current regime will not be there all the time, and the current ambassador who represents that regime will not be there all the time. It is important to know what exactly is going on in China. One will do so courteously, of course, but this must be done so that the facts are before us. To suggest that compulsory abortion and sterilisation are proscribed by law and are not policy is to indicate ignorance of what is occurring in China.

Well, I deliberately worded the motion so as not to imply anything in respect of the delegation. I assumed&mdash;I now realise that I assumed wrongly&mdash;that the delegation had not been given a copy of the Sichuan Province regulations, and particularly those regulations relating to compulsory abortion and sterilisation. I had assumed that because nothing was said in the report about it. The report did not say that in Sichuan Province the delegation members had challenged the family planning officials. Now we know that they did not get that part translated and therefore were not able to ask the question. </PARA>

It is all very well for Senator Bourne to say, `If you have all of the information, come along to me or somebody else who is going on a delegation and we will have a chat about it'.

The Senate should consider the missing females in China. Mr Acting Deputy President, you would know that there is a vast amount of evidence to show that millions of females are missing in China.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Construction Industry Reform and Development Bill has been introduced by the Government as its solution to problems within the construction industry in Australia. This solution is an absolutely classic example of the way this Government proposes to solve the problems of industry and of industrial relations within industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's solutions and the approach that the Opposition takes in solving these problems are poles apart. I hope that in the course of this debate I will be able to indicate why the Opposition is opposed to the approach of the Government generally in relation to these questions and specifically in relation to this Bill, which, as I said, is the Government's solution to a particular problem in a particular industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is because of that major gulf between the Government's proposal and that of the Opposition that we will be voting against the motion for the second reading of this Bill and we hope that we will thereby be able to succeed in defeating it and putting it aside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the Bill addresses the problems in the construction industry and proposes the Government's solution to them. That solution is being developed in the form of a national strategy for the construction industry which was first proposed by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) in September 1990. The Bill gives administrative support and backing to an agreement that has been reached between the Federal Government, some State governments, leading industry organisations, and the Building Workers Industrial Union, which is the major representative of employees in the construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this agreement to solve the problems of the industry has evolved with government blessing and government patronage and will now be backed by this legislation proposed by the Government. Through this legislation, the Government proposes to set up a construction industry development council which will be an advisory body. In other words, instead of having the consultations which have been going on between the industry, government and unions, a statutory body will be set up. If the consultations that have been going on have succeeded to the extent which the Government claims they have and that an in-principle agreement has been reached for major changes in the industry, one may ask why that process will be any better continued under statutory provision than by the method that has been developed up to date. But, of course, the Government has this extraordinary belief in the value of passing legislation through this Parliament as though that in itself will be the major solution to a problem. The Government seemed to justify its stance in the second reading speech where the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the industry considers that a strong and active role by government is an essential prerequisite to achieving substantial reforms in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA>This is clearly another example of the Government's longstanding policy of government leadership in developing solutions to industry problems. It harks back to its early days of `summitry' and so on. It has certainly been a theme throughout the life of this Government that it wants to have deals done between big government, big business and big unions, and that is the way it thinks all problems should be solved. As I have said, that is really the antithesis of the Opposition's solution to industry problems or economic problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, an agreement has already been entered into for the strategy that is seen to be required to solve the problems of the industry. It is a strategy which is set out very fully by the Minister in his second reading speech. He refers in great detail to the in-principle agreement which is designed to improve the performance of the industry generally. The agreement is not simply designed to improve industrial relations&mdash;work practices and removing restrictive practices&mdash;but is also designed to improve the efficiency and the managerial competence of the industry. It does so through a whole series of points set out in the in-principle agreement referred to in the Minister's speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister says that the Construction Industry Development Agency&mdash;although in the Bill it is called a reform agency, but that is to be amended&mdash;is to have the primary responsibility for ensuring that the parties adhere to the commitments in the agreement. But it is not apparent why it is necessary to have a statutory body for that purpose, unless it is thought that it will be better at spending money. Already, a good deal of money has been spent on this exercise and the Government is suggesting that a budget of another $10m will be appropriated for the agency to undertake this work the Government says is necessary for it to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incidentally, the Government has already persuaded the Building Workers Industrial Union to contribute to the funds needed for this reform process. It has transferred the sum of $1.5m from the construction employees redundancy trust to the agency. There is already a major issue as to whether it is legal or proper to appropriate moneys which have been obtained for purposes of redundancy for workers in the industry to the agency. So the birth of this exercise that the Minister has started is highly controversial, for many reasons. This appropriation of money is another matter of controversy which will undoubtedly be raised in the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the Opposition is concerned that we are now having these statutory bodies set up as part and parcel of this major industry reform exercise under the leadership of government. There are many, many problems in the construction industry and there have been for a long time. There have been a number of attempts to do something about them. We in the Opposition believe that the right steps have not been taken, and I will deal with that shortly. But let me say that this is not the first attempt to solve the problems of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the most notable attempt related to the moves which ultimately led to the deregistration of the BLF. That was seen to be one of the major reforms that was required in this industry and, ultimately, this Parliament took that step. But, associated with that step, were other non-statutory exercises which had been going on for some time in the wake of the deregistration of the BLF, whereby the Federal, Victorian and New South Wales governments particularly were endeavouring to get agreement on codes of practice in the industry. I understand that that process goes back to as long ago as 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the deregistration of the BLF appears to have left the field pretty much to the Builders Workers Industrial Union and, although that union may have been a more moderate union than the BLF, that union itself has engaged in a great deal of union militancy of which the Opposition certainly would disapprove, and I think that in some respects probably the Government would also. To some extent, the BWIU has become a successor in title of the BLF. With the removal of the BLF, its position has, of course, been strengthened. As I said, in many respects it has taken over the role that was performed, although in a more militant way, by the BLF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should also note that we are dealing only with the construction industry. Although there has been a tendency to refer to this industry as `the building and construction industry', the legislation is certainly confined, and the in-principle agreement is confined, to the construction industry itself. That industry, which is a large one in itself&mdash;the Minister says it employs about 500,000 people&mdash;does not cover the whole of the building industry. We are talking about that part of the industry which puts up buildings in the central business districts and major shopping centres around Australia&mdash;and does the major industrial type building. Of course, a great deal of Australia's development is covered by this construction industry, and the particular union, the BWIU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this whole strategy is being driven by that union on the one hand; and, on the employers' side, the major players are the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors and, to some extent but a lesser one, the Master Builders Association. There are also one or two other employer bodies that play subsidiary roles in this industry. But the legislation does not cover&mdash;and we are not discussing in this debate&mdash;what is known as the cottage industry, the building of houses and smaller constructions around the country. There is, indeed, a major difference between the structures of these two industries. The industry which is the subject of our debate here is certainly dominated by these big contractors and by this big union, the BWIU. It is with these players that the Government&mdash;and not only the Federal Government but also State governments&mdash;is in discussion and will become a partner, so to speak, in the solution of the problems of that particular industry, whereas the building industry, as it is probably more popularly thought of in Australia, that is, the industry that builds houses around the country, is a very different industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an industry which we think provides a much better pattern of industrial relations arrangements. That industry, the employers in that industry, rely particularly on the employment of subcontractors. The people who actually do the work are not employees and are not members of the BWIU&mdash;in many cases they are not members of any union. They are subcontractors and they make up a much more efficient industry than the construction industry that we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, it is acknowledged on all sides that that industry has had enormous problems. One of its major problems has been the pressures that have been brought to bear on employers by overly powerful unions&mdash;as I said, in the first place the BLF and now the BWIU. The industry has been characterised by the`no ticket, no start' principle, the closed shop&mdash;in effect, de facto compulsory unionism&mdash;which has been at the root of the problems. The problem has been the unions' power and methods. As I said, there has been on all sides agreement on the disruption caused by the BLF in the sense that this Parliament some time ago was prevailed upon to actually take the very strong step of itself, by legislation, deregistering that union. That was an unheard of thing for the Parliament to do, but the problems had become so horrific that it was clearly necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there now seems to be some lessening of the tension between employers and employees to the extent that they believe that they can solve the problems of this industry by the methods set out in the Government's strategy and the legislation that is before us. It is with that that the Opposition disagrees. We believe that there are better ways of doing it.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In search of other ways of solving the problem, the New South Wales Government several years ago set up a royal commission, presided over by Mr Roger Gyles, known as the Gyles Royal Commission. That Commission has been sitting for a considerable time now but has not yet reported. The report of that Royal Commission should be a major contribution to this debate in terms of deciding what would be the right way to go, but the Government has not waited for that. It has persisted with its own solutions to the problems and has come up with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems fairly clear that this exercise is designed to pre-empt the findings of the Gyles Royal Commission into the industry. That in itself is a matter of concern, and we would certainly be a lot happier debating this subject after we had seen what the Gyles Royal Commission has come up with, rather than proceeding now in a way which clearly pre-empts the findings of that Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already indicated, the Opposition is concerned that this whole process is being driven by the large players in the construction industry. We are certainly also concerned that the whole agenda has been captured by the Building Workers Industrial Union and that the interests and methods of operation of that union will be entrenched. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also concerned that the approach of the Government&mdash;this big employer, big business, big union, big government solution; the in-principle agreement between the big players&mdash;is not the way to go. It threatens to transmit to all sections of the industry the standards that are being applied on construction sites in the big cities, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne, to a large extent by militancy and muscle. Those practices will be transmitted throughout the whole of this industry. The efficient cottage building industry could even be threatened by these excessive standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be that, by giving statutory force to this agency, the industry will tend to be closed to other than the major firms, whose practices will obviously be the preferred solution. Thereby, we will be locking out a whole range of small specialist contractors, skilled tradesmen and professionals who have played a major role in the past and who have been highly efficient. The whole industry in the future would then be characterised by solutions proposed by the big players. This would lead to the removal of a great deal of competition. As I have already said, we are very concerned about the effect that this whole process will have in terms of the adoption of the BWIU agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have given the reasons why the Opposition is opposed to this legislation and to the solutions put forward by the Government. Obviously we are not opposed to many of the attempts that have been made here to get better work practices, more efficiency, less confrontation and so on in the industry. Discussions of that kind are perfectly desirable; we are not opposed to them. However, we are opposed to confining this whole matter to the big players and then having their solutions adopted by this Parliament, with all the influence that that brings to bear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is certainly a lack of sanctions in the legislation. I am pleased to note that the Government is not proposing in any way to impose the usual legislative sanctions. The proposed agency will have a big budget. This agency will have the authority of the Government and this Parliament, and we believe that that will have very serious consequences on the future development of this very important industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already identified the most undesirable and dangerous elements of this legislation. The construction industry is a classic example of what happens when there are closed shops; when the no ticket, no start principle, which has been used by the powerful unions of this industry for so long, is allowed to continue. It is only when that most evil practice is eradicated from this system, and from industrial relations generally in this country, that there will be any real effective changes for the better in the construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's policy is to eliminate compulsory unionism, be it de facto or by legislation. The term  `preference to unionist' is used in Federal laws. Of course, we know that compulsory unionism has been legislated for in some States. But in this industry compulsory unionism was brought about by powerful unions such as the BLF and is now being continued by the BWIU. That is a fundamental problem in this industry and it has to be eradicated before any real solutions can be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can have all the discussions, goodwill and agreements in the world, and we can have legislation of one sort or another, but none of it will be effective until this cancer in the whole of this industry&mdash;the no ticket, no start principle&mdash;is abolished. That will have to be done by legislation. Of course, it will be done by the Opposition on our return to government. I have put forward the principal objections of the Opposition to this legislation and set out our reasons why we intend to vote against it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Teague)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Before calling Senator Bell, I note that the lights are dimmed in the Senate and that there is a storm in Canberra.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I am not sure what my role in that illumination will be. I found some of the matters raised by Senator Durack certainly interesting. Others might need to be challenged, or at least addressed by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook); that is his responsibility, not mine. I will confine myself to our reaction to the Construction Industry Reform and Development Bill 1991 and the proposal to establish the Construction Industry Council, which I think is to be called the Construction Industry Development Agency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept of a forum or peak council is one which has been demonstrated to have considerable advantages in other areas of our decision making process. I refer here to the Grain Council, Wool Council, Cattle Council and other peak advisory bodies and forums that we see throughout Australia. The danger is that, with the creation of such councils, there is the opportunity to create another level of either bureaucracy, or at least representation, which can stand between government and those who are having decisions made about them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While that is a danger, I believe that there is the opportunity in this case to ensure that this body remains what it is intended to be, which is a forum for the discussion of those very problems about which Senator Durack was speaking. The very problems which beset our construction industry are problems which must be discussed. If a royal commission in New South Wales has been busy for some seven years without it reaching an outcome, it is obvious that those problems are of great consequence. With a facilitating development agency attached to the role of this forum and with that agency to cease operations on 1 July 1995, I can see that we are not entrenching a set of representations which will stand in the way, but rather something that will facilitate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> and was reminded that the Industry Commission's recommendations in its March 1991 report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Construction costs of major projects</EMPHASIS> included that governments need to speed up reviews of regulations, standards and administrative procedures in order to reduce uncertainty and delays and to lower costs resulting from differences in standards and regulations, I thought to myself that this was being done. I harked back to my understanding that there was in existence an Australian uniform building regulations coordinating council and that there had been an intergovernmental agreement in about 1984. I was certain that there had been published a national building code for Australia and that all States had introduced at least the technical requirements of it. I checked up and contacted some people I knew who were involved in that process. I thought that this would have been a big part of that recommendation of the Industry Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I came to this place I was in the construction industry and I worked closely with architects who were taking part in the introduction of the national specifications, which are virtually a standard system of specifying for buildings, on the architectural side of the construction industry. Having reminded myself of that, I realised that they were on the technical and design side and that this particular industry council is to be on the personnel, management and work practices side. Of course, I realised that the existence of the council would not exclude the process, which I knew of and which was already taking place. In fact, that process has now been developed and has received a considerable amount of support from within the construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In architecture in particular, the introduction of the Natspec system has replaced the previous inefficiencies that had a considerable reputation for adding to the cost of major buildings. I refer to the previous practices that applied at least in government buildings. For instance, where I once worked I saw them applied to a hose reel cover, which is a statutory requirement for a government building. It is a box that covers the fire hose. A draughtsperson was employed to come up with a design for it, to draw it up and to specify it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fence around a school shed, which had to be of a statutory height, required an initiative to be taken, a new drawing to be created and for it to be specified, all according to set standards, but every one had to be done afresh. Even the cubicles in school toilets were redrawn each time and re-specified for each new building. Of course, honourable senators would immediately agree that such a practice was ridiculously wasteful of time and even of materials. This was done even though all such components of buildings had to meet statutory regulations in terms of size, shape and description. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Royal Australian Institute of Architects has been instrumental in encouraging its members to adopt the new Natspec system of standardised, nationally consistent specifications and their formulation and presentation as part of the architectural package. That has led to a great improvement in efficiency and consistency and it has made a technical contribution to reducing design costs in the construction industry. What I now note is that this Bill delivers to the Construction Industry Reform Agency the responsibility for achieving developments in the other areas of the construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that one of the Industry Commission's recommendations said that governments could hasten labour market reform by insisting that more efficient labour and management practices were adopted on construction sites. It seems there is little we can do from this legislation, and from the particular angle of the Bill, to require that such practices be reformed. That will be the role, as I see it, of the agency itself after the forum of the Construction Industry Development Council has determined priorities. To me, that seems to be the appropriate way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats see it as a priority that that forum should assist with the development of energy efficient practices in building design. We do not have the opportunity here either to require that certain practices of management be adopted, or to require that certain practices of energy efficiency be adopted. But if enlightened advanced design is adopted, it is much easier to construct that in order to manage buildings so that they consume less energy. That would be apparent immediately to anybody who knew anything about the construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an area of great wastefulness, actually, and it is an area that is constantly developing as people&mdash;especially building owners and managers&mdash;recognise that, if efficiencies are sought at the input stage of design and construction, the cost of running a building can be reduced considerably. It is not just a question of turning the lights off&mdash;something which has occupied our minds here in this building in the last few minutes&mdash;but of energy efficiency itself. It is not just a question of turning the lights off when there is nobody in the building but it can also include such matters as the correct insulation of foundations. It can include intelligent, self-monitoring heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems. It can include strategies which are now almost mandatory, such as the optimum orientation of buildings towards or away from the sunlight, landscaping, tree shading et cetera. It can also include access to other buildings, airlocks and passageways. It can include waste incineration or disposal practices and it can include parking and orientation to traffic, and the orientation to other buildings in the area. These are the sorts of issues which the Australian Democrats believe can be profitably pursued within the Construction Industry Development Council forum. The opportunities are there. We believe that, correctly addressed, this could be a great facilitator of further efficiencies in our construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Durack was right to identify the difference between the cottage building industry, often represented by the Housing Industry Association or the Master Builders Association, and the construction industry itself. I do not think it is right to extrapolate that the practices of the cottage building industry are relevant always to the construction industry, or vice versa. We should not assume that practices which may prove to be efficient in the construction industry will necessarily be carried over to the cottage industry. Such an assumption is misguided, and certainly defies the reality that exists in these industries. They are very different, as Senator Durack rightly observed. They are so different that I think it is quite wrong to assume that whatever is developed at this forum and implemented through this agency would actually be transferred and might threaten the cottage industry. That is wrong, and I have no fears that that will occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In supporting the general thrust of this Bill and what it proposes to achieve, the Democrats will move, in the committee stage, a small amendment which attaches to the Council the obligation to follow certain practices in the auditing stage. I will give more details about that in the committee stage, but I forewarn the Senate that that is what we intend to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that that adequately presents our position on this matter. As I said, if the issues raised by Senator Durack are to be addressed I believe it is the responsibility of the Minister and not the Australian Democrats to do that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Construction Industry Reform and Development Bill 1991 is yet another cosmetic gesture by this Labor Government to make it look as if it is really serious about industrial relations and structural reform. In fact, of course, it is nothing of the sort. The Government claims that the legislation relates to a broadly based strategy for the building industry, and that it will cover workplace reform, industry development and building regulation. This would be very commendable if it were workable and if there were not another hidden agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reality, the legislation is nothing more than a costly and extravagant attempt to foist the standards and practices of the Building Workers Industrial Union onto every building and construction site in Australia. It is an attempt to entrench the big players in the industry at the expense of the small and individual operators. The Government has pre-empted this Parliament&mdash;and, indeed, the debate on this legislation&mdash;and has already established on an interim basis the Construction Industry Reform Agency. The Agency board is made up of some of the most powerful and influential people in the building and construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former Prime Minister announced in December that Mr Paul White, group construction director of the Concrete Constructions group, had been appointed as chairman of the Agency board. Most of the other board members are equally highly placed, being the chief executives or equivalent from Kinhill Engineers, Fletcher Construction Group, AMP Property Investments, Thiess Contractors, Hooker Cochram, the ACTU and the Building Workers Industrial Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that all of this is already in place is yet another example of this Government's arrogance and contempt for this Parliament. It is asking the Parliament to rubber stamp legislation that is to all intents and purposes an established fact. It is more legislation by decree, as we have come to expect from this Government. This Senate should in no way be prepared to rubber stamp this legislation&mdash;or, indeed, any other piece of legislation. It is particularly so with regard to this legislation because it has been pushed through as an apparently innocuous Bill full of motherhood statements about industrial relations reform when in reality it will achieve nothing of the sort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand from both industry and government sources that the Government and the Building Workers Industrial Union are, through this legislation, attempting to pre-empt the findings of the Greiner Government's Royal Commission into Productivity in the Building Industry in New South Wales. I also understand that in reality the Building Workers Industrial Union has absolutely no intention of tackling the deep seated problems of the industry. Instead, it intends to make a few superficial reforms while at the same time ensuring that its own undesirable practices and standards are imposed at every level. For example, the industry maximum standards that have been achieved on construction sites in Sydney and Melbourne in relation to workers compensation, superannuation and redundancy payments would become applicable throughout the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only those firms which comply with these standards will be allowed to operate, thus virtually forcing small operators, specialist contractors and the skilled tradespeople out of the building and construction industry. It will extend the closed shop of the construction worker to include, in effect, the closed shop of the construction employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the Government's claims that it has the support of the industry because the major players have signed the in-principle reform and development agreement, it is significant that several small industry organisations have refused to sign it or to participate in the Construction Industry Development Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One industry organisation says privately that it is only participating under duress and that it may have a better chance of control over the process by being part of it, rather than by being on the outside. This organisation also holds little hope that any real reform of industrial relations in the construction industry will be achieved through this legislation and the resulting structures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales Government has refused to participate and is leaving its options open. It is quite rightly waiting to hear the findings of the Gyles Royal Commission, which may very well come up with quite different recommendations from those of the organisation to be established by this legislation. As Senator Durack said earlier in this debate, the proper thing for this Government to do would be to wait for the findings and the recommendations of that Royal Commission before taking any action. In fact, as I said earlier, the real goal of this legislation is to pre-empt the findings of that Royal Commission because its findings maybe unpalatable to the BWIU and this Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales Government is well aware that there have been codes of conduct within the construction industry since 1986 and that these have been largely ineffective. It is not surprising that the New South Wales Government has strong reservations about this Federal reform strategy. Those reservations have also been echoed by the New South Wales Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales Royal Commission has issued a discussion paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Industrial Relations in The Building Industry: Historical Overview and Avenues for Change</EMPHASIS>. That document contains a record of similar initiatives in industrial relations reform taken during the last decade. In its discussion paper the Commission has a long section on the decline of the so-called top down approach. This discussion illustrates how repeated attempts by government bodies, unions and employer groups to impose codes of practice on the building industry have consistently failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Referring to the blueprint for building industry development negotiated in 1988 between the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors, the Building Workers Industrial Union, and the ACTU, the paper says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was an example of people being obsessed with developing a new process as if the process itself once established, will automatically deliver some benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>For another good example of the failure of the top down approach, we need look no further than the accord and the centralised wages system that this Government continues to advocate. These two aspects of our industrial relations system consistently fail to recognise the needs and capacities of individual workers and individual enterprises, and they have been partly responsible for the massive level of unemployment in this country, currently standing at well over one million people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps even more serious and damaging is the dubious legality of an extraordinary transfer of $1.5m from the Construction Employees Redundancy Trust to the Construction Industry Reform Agency being established by this legislation. The Gyles Royal Commission in New South Wales is currently investigating whether the trustees of the Construction Employees Redundancy Trust had the right to make this transfer of funds. The trust was set up as a charitable trust to meet redundancy payments to building workers. It is funded by contributions, mainly from small building contractors and sub-contractors at the rate of $40 per week, per employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 29 November last year, the Executive Director of the Master Plumbers and Mechanical Contractors Association sent a letter of complaint about the transfer of funds to the building Royal Commissioner, Mr Roger Gyles, QC. His reported response to that complaint makes it clear that he has very serious doubts about the legality of the transaction. He might very well have added a comment about the dubious morality of it as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Master Plumbers Association said, the transfer of funds was, and I quote, `Political and against the best interests of the plumbing industry'. The whole exercise smacks of similar attempts to reform the waterfront and the shipping industry, most of which have been all talk and very little action on the part of this Government or the unions, except for the spending of large sums of money on government inquiries and reports, and the setting up of reform authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far, in the construction industry, we have had a whole string of reports, recommendations, committees, in principle agreements and the like. Eighteen months and several million dollars later, all we have is a lot of talk, a larger bureaucracy and a commitment to spend a further $10.8m over the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The functions of the Construction Industry Reform Agency are spelled out in only very general and vague terms in this Bill. We have to turn to the recommendations of the Industrial Relations Working Party report to find the role and functions of the Agency in more detail. Ostensibly, the Bill aims to reform the construction industry and make it internationally competitive through what the Minister for Industrial Relations referred to as `real and tangible improvements in performance standards'. On the surface this looks like a good idea, and the Opposition certainly supports such a proposition. The trouble is that world-class competitiveness cannot be achieved in isolation. Unless the improvements are enacted in tandem with reforms across the whole spectrum of industrial relations, transport and the taxation system, they simply will not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this Government is really serious about reforming the construction industry, it should be looking positively at the coalition's Fightback package and our industrial relations policy as the blueprint on how to achieve real reform. It should not be trying to tear it apart by spurious and inaccurate analyses and claims with regard to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the Government's cynical move to entrench union power by the minimum membership requirement of 10,000 makes true enterprise bargaining absolutely impossible. The mega-unions created are unwieldy in size and are the very antithesis of enterprise bargaining unions, which this Government now belatedly claims to be championing. One simply cannot have genuine enterprise bargaining units when one has mega-unions in place. It is an absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seventy per cent of the construction industry is now covered by a new union called the Construction, Forestry and Mining Employees Union, which has 96,000 members and is expected to grow to some 200,000 within 12 months. The union, the CFMEU&mdash;even the acronym is unwieldy&mdash;brings together the Building Workers Industrial Union, the Australian Timber Workers Union, the Allied Industries Union and the United Mineworkers Federation of Australia. One may well ask what interests they have in common in view of the various industries in which they work. A number of quite unrelated industries there are being combined into the one union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two more unions, the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association&mdash;again one may question the relevance to the building industry&mdash;and the Operative Plasterers and Plaster Workers Federation, which certainly does have a closer relationship, are due to vote soon on amalgamating with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Construction, Forestry and Mining Employees Union has said that it has the potential to expand its membership to more than 300,000. A union of that size cannot possibly look after the individual needs of its members and it cannot possibly have the flexibility needed to cope with individual workplace needs and demands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government may claim that it wants enterprise bargaining, but in reality it is simply mouthing platitudes. It has no genuine commitment to genuine enterprise bargaining. If it were really serious it would not tolerate allowing union power to be concentrated in the hands of so few. The reality is that you can only have genuine enterprise bargaining if you have voluntary unionism in place and if you have a requirement that no third parties be involved in those negotiations except at the behest of the employees involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amalgamations are not sitting easily with all of the unions involved, either. There are already tensions arising between the different interests of employers and rival unions. There is a struggle going on for control of the construction industry, between the Building Workers Industrial Union and the Federation of Industrial, Manufacturing and Engineering Employees. The Industrial Relations Commission is due to start hearing a dispute between the two very soon. </PARA>
<PARA>There is also an ongoing power struggle between the Australian Workers Union and the Building Workers Industrial Union over who will have control of the construction and building industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the claims that is often made for these mega-unions is that they will remove demarcation difficulties. Yet here we have a struggle going on between the unions themselves for power, for membership and for control of various sectors of the work force&mdash;obviously a problem with demarcation. Now that the BWIU has amalgamated with the United Mineworkers Federation of Australia, we also have a struggle going on over which union will control the mining industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week the Australian Workers Union lodged an application with the Industrial Relations Commission to exclude the Construction, Forestry and Mining Employees Union and the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association from the metalliferous mining industry. None of this points to a smooth passage of reform for the construction industry. Indeed, quite the opposite: a bigger union representing construction industry workers is not going to stamp out the rampant work rorts so prevalent on construction sites and elsewhere. It is not going to assist the abolition of the closed shop, the `no ticket, no start' regime that operates to the detriment of Australia in industry right across the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not have true reform of the construction industry&mdash;or of any other industry for that matter&mdash;until compulsory unionism is abolished and workers can choose whether they want to belong to a union. If they choose to belong to a union, they must have an open choice as to which particular union they join. The coalition will not support the establishment of a bureaucratic process using the top down approach, which only entrenches the power of the big players in this industry and the Building Workers Industrial Union, which has the capacity to hold the industry to ransom, and which will exclude the smaller operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does support the professed aims of the reform strategy, but we will not support a process which ignores the realities of true enterprise bargaining, as I spelt out a few moments ago, and which will force all employers to adhere to a national code of payment and work practices regardless of their individual circumstances. We will not condone the establishment of yet another bureaucracy, and the spending of almost $11m of taxpayers' money, which will benefit no-one except the Building Workers Industrial Union and the major construction companies. We will not support a process which quite clearly does not have the support of a large part of the industry it claims to be reforming. For all of those reasons, it is obvious that the Opposition will not support this legislation. I urge the Senate generally likewise to oppose its passage. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a truth we tapped when we began the task of changing our industrial culture, from one in which employers and workers are always at each other's throats, to one where they talk about how to do things better.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But basic standards must be met. We will not support slashing minimum wages and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>That all sounds wonderful. Indeed, it seems at first glance that the Government has pinched our industrial relations policy. But when one goes into it, one finds that behind the rhetoric there are very basic differences. It is far from our planned reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The differences are basic, so I will just compare two of them. The Government still demands that even in workplace agreements the relevant union must conduct the negotiating between the employer and his employees. Nothing in the Prime Minister's statement mentions unions: not a word. He kept them out of his statement. Nevertheless, he insists that the unions conduct the negotiations between the employer and the employees, even though only 32 per cent of private sector workers in Australia belong to unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government insists that the agreements must also be registered with the Industrial Relations Commission. Our policy allows for choices. It allows those employees who are members of trade unions to have a choice&mdash;either to stay with the centralised system to negotiate with the employer directly, without recourse to the Industrial Relations Commission or the unions, or to ask the unions to negotiate on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those 68 per cent of private sector workers who do not belong to unions and who prefer to negotiate with their employer directly will be able to do so, bearing in mind that they cannot negotiate below a minimum wage. That is one basic difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next very basic difference is that we believe in voluntary unionism. Voluntary unionism is one of the very basic tenets of democracy. As you would be well aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, I have spoken in this place many times about the Australian Labor Party's special brand of democracy&mdash;a very special brand that suits its particular thoughts on democracy. It is not one that we on this side of the House agree with at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke last time about that special brand of Labor democracy when we were talking about political advertising and the right of some people to indulge in free time political advertising which does not extend to everyone who wants to stand for politics. Again, this Government's special brand of democracy forces many Australian workers to join unions, whether they want to or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all remember the Australian Bill of Rights. That, of course, was defeated by the people, as well as by the Opposition in this Parliament. The Government's Australian Bill of Rights gave the people the right to join an association but did not give them a right not to join if they so chose. Why? Because those in the Government believe in compulsory unionism. I only have to look at the Transport Workers Union in this city, over which Senator Bolkus presides, to find that that particular union says, `No ticket, no start if you want to be a Comcar driver. We will not allow you out of the door unless you are a union member'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are still very basic differences in the policies of the Government and the Opposition. However, it is interesting to note how far the Government has come in changing its thinking. When John Howard first expressed his views on workplace bargaining in August 1983, when he was the shadow Treasurer, the Government carried on as though we were trying to abolish all unions. The vitriol was extraordinary. Government members jumped up and down and carried on and said that it was the worst example of getting stuck into the unions or union bashing that could be imagined. Yet now the Government is talking about workplace bargaining. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow Minister for northern Australia, Senator Tambling, issued a press statement to that effect. Senator Tambling's statement, no doubt supported by Senator Macdonald, asserted that in northern Australia `no-one' would benefit from the package recently delivered&mdash;no-one. I do not know how we are supposed to take these knockers from the north seriously. I think it is about time they started talking up this region of Australia instead of continually talking it down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also point out to Senator Tambling that very important sections of this package have been widely welcomed by his constituents in the Northern Territory, who appear to have a different view. Forget for an instant, if we can, all the stimulus contained in this package for tourism, mining, the rural sectors and small business, all of which are the engine for employment growth in the north. Let us take a look at one area which will affect many of those hardest hit currently by the recession, and that is the one-off family allowance bonus that is going to be delivered in April,  followed up by increases in payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In April alone that will inject an additional $4m of Federal funding into the economy of the Northern Territory and $15m into north Queensland. Considering the people it will be directed to, all of that will be spent in the local economies of both north Queensland and the Northern Territory. If Senator Tambling asserts that no benefit is contained in that package and wants to take it back, there are enough white pointers on the rest of the Opposition front bench&mdash;plenty of them&mdash;who will be happy to take it for South Australia, Victoria, Western Australia or Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I personally do not want to give it away. Senator Tambling is apparently quite happy to give it away because he says there is no benefit. Senator Tambling and Senator Macdonald say that all of this additional income for low income earners from Federal funding is not welcome and that the tax cuts, which will have 70 per cent of Northern Territory taxpayers on 30c in the dollar without being slugged with 15 per cent on their air fares, telephone accounts, electricity accounts, bread, milk and so on, are of no benefit to the Northern Territory.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For a great many years the Australian Government has consistently opposed the Arab economic boycott of Israel. The boycott has been applied by member states of the Arab League, with varying degrees of intensity for some 40 years, to limit international trade relations with Israel. The existence of the boycott, quite apart from its inherent obnoxiousness, is obviously detrimental to promoting an atmosphere conducive to finding a solution to the Arab-Israel conflict. Several times I have urged Arab governments to dismantle the boycott as a gesture of goodwill, which I would expect Israel to reciprocate in other ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the Zionist Federation of Australia presented me with a very detailed submission urging the enactment of Australian legislation similar to United States legislation which does outlaw compliance with the boycott. The submission also pointed out that some Australian chambers of commerce were effectively complying with the boycott by issuing certificates of origin, apparently with government authority, overstamped with the printed assertion that the goods in question had no association with Israel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am not yet quite persuaded that legislation on this subject is appropriate, I have decided to keep under active review that possibility. More specifically, and more immediately, in relation to certificates of origin, I have now written to umbrella associations of chambers of commerce reminding them that no chambers have Australian Government authorisation and have never had such authorisation for overstamping certificates of origin with statements that effectively comply with the boycott and that they certainly should not claim, expressly or impliedly, such authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also directed my Department to remind all government departments concerned with the boycott of Australian Government guidelines on dealing with boycott offices. These guidelines stress that any approach to boycott offices should be made only on clearance or instructions from Canberra and that where direct contact is unavoidable in order, for example, to clear up some factual error in its application to some particular company this should be done orally and in as low key a manner as practicable. Moreover, official Australian contacts with the boycott offices, to the extent that they are ever necessary, will always be made in circumstances in the future which make absolutely clear that Australia opposes the boycott and that contacts with boycott offices to assist Australian companies do not imply in any way tacit acceptance of the boycott.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the general marketing practices of life insurance and superannuation agents are concerned, there are widespread misgivings and concerns in the Australian community about the practices, I think highlighted by some notorious cases. Unfortunately, that leads to a stereotyping and a sort of caricature of life insurance agents which is undeserved, no doubt, by the great majority of the 16,000 life insurance agencies or agents around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I announced in Launceston a week or so ago to the Life Insurance Underwriters Association conference, there will be an inquiry undertaken by the Trade Practices Commission into the actual experience of Australians out in the marketplace purchasing these very important policies which are designed to deal with security in old age, with the possibility of loss of employment through disability or accident or some sort of illness, or what should happen in the case of death. It is a very important part of future planning for Australians. It is important to know whether some of the problems that arise are widespread and how they should be remedied. There seems to me to be confusion, for example, as to whether a life insurance agent is an impartial adviser or just a sales person. I think that this confusion of identity can lead to some unfortunate experiences for those who purchase these policies. What is the impact of early termination? We know that if these policies are terminated early, quite often there are no benefits available at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of disclosure of commissions is a very contentious matter, with arguments on all sides. Unless the purchaser of a policy knows that an agent is earning a commission and the scope of that commission, they might not be able to ascertain whether they are being offered a product simply because higher commission attaches, whereas the life insurance agents argue that there is another side to that debate. We need empirical experience gathered by the Trade Practices Commission, and it is on the basis of that unbiased survey of what happens in the marketplace that the Government can come to reasonable policy decisions.</PARA>

There will be women who are unemployed. Many of them, of course, are not entitled to unemployment benefit but they are part of families in which poverty is a very real problem. There will be women who work inadequate hours because the businesses for which they work are in difficulty and are struggling to keep their heads above water.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is almost unbelievable that the package Mr Keating flaunted so loudly has offered little or no hope for thousands of Australian women who are seeking employment, or training and education for future employment. Only last Friday in Sydney a delegate of the Australian Services Union turned to Senator West and said, `Why is there nothing for women, Senator West, in your Prime Minister's statement?'. That is not an unusual view amongst the women that I have spoken to since that package came out. Indeed, I draw the Senate's attention to the terms of the motion because they are virtually what Senator Sowada said this week in a press statement which she also released on this subject. I could not have agreed with her more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who want paid work and who are fortunate enough to have a job in the paid work force have been offered no positive initiatives to ensure financial security through savings plans or tax cuts.

Those incentives benefit everybody. They will help get this country out of recession. But this Government has failed to acknowledge the need for assistance in those areas for people in the work force. A blind eye has been turned to Australian workers with family responsibilities. There is no help in the Government's package for women who combine paid work with work in the home, caring for children, for sick or elderly relatives. In total, the One Nation package ignores the employment needs of women. </PARA>

I am pleased to see one thing in the package the Prime Minister released, and that is that he has adopted our proposal for a substantial injection of funds into TAFE, which is of tremendous importance to women who are trying to re-enter the paid work force. It is the place where they start their way back. Under our Fightback education proposals we targeted TAFE to be an important area of training for women through our promise to transform and expand it into a high status, vocational education and training system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women today face an appalling problem in trying to get higher education. Up to 50,000 qualified school leavers have missed out on university places this year. More than 150,000 students have been locked out of TAFE. That plight has been made even more desperate by the recession we had to have, caused by the Prime Minister that we are stuck with. They cannot get a job while they wait to get into a training institution. The education and training of our young have to be among the most important investments any country can make. It is all very well to go on about giving girls equal opportunity and encouraging them to take up maths and sciences and then letting them fall off the edge of a cliff when they leave school. It is cruel and it is no way to raise the next generation. We have just seen an utter failure in the Government's ideologically driven policy for universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment has to be the highest concern of all Australians today. There have been no practical solutions for job creation in areas where women's employment needs to be encouraged. Senator Sowada said this week that unfortunately the only jobs which will be created for women by the economic statement appear to be as waitresses and chambermaids for the tourism industry. As a member of a family that is active in the tourism industry, I hope that it does grow and thrive and that there will be jobs there, but we are turning out youngsters who have a variety of aspirations. Should that be all that they can aspire to? Surely they want choice and diversity. P.P. McGuinness in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> this week said:</PARA>

<PARA>There will not be many jobs for women in that lot. Senator Sowada was also right when she claimed that there appears to be little assistance for the 353,000 women looking for full time or part time work or for the 103,000 women who have given up in disgust. Those are the women who will not be celebrating next Sunday, those hundreds of thousands of women who cannot get the work that they need.

There are 99,300 young unemployed women aged 15 to 19 years, 33,100 looking for part time work and 66,200 looking for full time work.

Another ABS survey for January shows that over half a million Australians were underemployed in January this year.

Fightback will remove almost $20 billion&mdash;not million, but billion&mdash;in taxes on inputs, employment and exports so that we can bolster the competitive position of our industries.

We recognise that our industrial relations policy will enable women to negotiate for packages which suit them personally and give them better opportunities for care for the elderly as well as child-care. They will be able to get the advantage of the extra $90m which we are putting into the child-care system to enable increased family support.

She will probably be rather embarrassed to have made a number of the statements she has made today. Senator Newman talked about women struggling with poverty; yet she failed to acknowledge the struggle that women would have if the coalition were ever to get the opportunity to introduce its Fightback package. I have here in front of me just some of the rhetoric used by Senator Newman&mdash;rhetoric that has been absolutely discredited by exposure of the detail of the cutbacks in public expenditure proposed by the coalition in the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for Senator Newman to say, `There should be more money for this' and `We should spend more money on that'. Senator Newman's Party is committed to cutting back public expenditure. The Opposition has a Thatcherite policy&mdash;a New Zealand-type regressive model. The Opposition's consumption tax, combined with the dramatic cutbacks in the public sector, would be devastating for all Australians but they would particularly impact on women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me talk just a little about the One Nation package, because Senator Newman seems to think that all these initiatives are failures. A four-year strategy for growth does not sound like a failure to me. Is increased expenditure on labour market programs a failure? Are reforms for small business failures? Is $720m on vocational training a failure? What about the national focus on tourism expansion? Senator Newman would count that as a failure too. She would dismiss the very real role that women play in the tourism industry. They object to being dismissed as chambermaids and whatever other terms Senator Newman uses to refer to them. That is an insult to the very important role that Australian women play in the tourism industry. What about the increased expenditure on the textiles, clothing and footwear industry? As far as Senator Newman is concerned, all of that is a mere nothing; that is just a failure. </PARA>

It is not so very long ago that Senator Newman came into this place suggesting that women should not be in the work force; that the only reason they were in the work force was that they did not have enough money to live on a single wage.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at this Government's record on jobs and social infrastructure&mdash;a social infrastructure that would be completely undercut and in fact devastated by this Fightback package, which would slash public sector expenditure. When this Government came to office, 44 per cent of women were in the work force; that figure is now over 52 per cent. This high participation rate has happened partly because the Government has created jobs and partly because we have made it possible for women to go to work by creating over 100,000 child-care places to add to the 46,000 that were there when we started. That is what I mean about social infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great achievements of this Government is that women are finally being accepted as an integral part of the Australian work force.

They have a legitimate place and they have legitimate skills and expertise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working women have already benefited from this Government's introduction of traineeships in areas where women's skills have previously not been recognised.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government's retirement incomes policy has extended superannuation for the first time to many women workers, most of whom were excluded in the past.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women, especially those of a non-English speaking background, will also benefit disproportionately from the extra funds for literacy programs. In recent years, women have been increasingly represented and very successful in small business.

I am sure that small business women would say that none of those items were failures to the extent that women will be affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So much for saying that this package does not meet the needs of women. There is a lot in it for women. The Government's performance over nine years includes many initiatives that I will now detail. For instance, in employment, it was this Government that passed the Sex Discrimination Act, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act and the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act. We introduced permanent part time work for Australian Public Service employees, we ratified ILO Convention No. 156 on workers with family responsibilities, and we established the work and family unit and the equal pay unit in the Department of Industrial Relations. This Government also launched the Australian women's employment strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to education and training, we were the ones to introduce schemes to improve work opportunities for female apprentices. Under previous Liberal governments, female apprentices were not recognised unless they were working in very traditional areas. This Government introduced the Australian traineeship schemes and the national policy for the education of girls in Australian schools, and announced a national plan of action for women in TAFE and the national plan of action for women in tertiary education. It is only under this Government that women have begun to outnumber men in higher education for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us now look at women's employment. Women's employment has been less affected by the recession than men's employment. The current seasonally adjusted unemployment rates for males and females as of January 1992 are 10.6 per cent and 9.8 per cent respectively. Between May and November 1991, women's labour force participation declined slightly by only 0.3 per cent to 51.5 per cent, after reaching a peak of 52.3 per cent in September 1991. Nevertheless, this Government recognises that women make up a large percentage of the disadvantaged. The following programs are directed at enhancing their employment prospects. The Commonwealth Employment Service, CES, has established equity targets for the placement of disadvantaged groups, including sole parents, the majority of whom are women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additional assistance for unemployed people has been provided in Skillshare as part of the March 1991 industry statement, which increases benefits for women.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spent half of my time focusing on the very proud record of first the Hawke Government and now the Keating Government in relation to women in Australia. Now I would like to focus on just what would happen if the coalition were actually to come to office and how that would impact on women workers. Women workers would be among the worst affected victims of the Hewson consumption tax package. Earlier Senator Newman was talking about government having its hands in the pockets of workers. But that is nothing compared to what it would be like if the coalition were to have its hands in the pockets and the purses and the wallets of people at the supermarkets, at the child-care centre, paying the electricity bill, et cetera. Wherever we went to spend our dollars we would have to pay that 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I had the opportunity to visit Canada recently I have some small experience of how that policy is working there. In Canada the consumption tax is only 7 per cent federally because it is also applied at the State level, which still only brings it up to 13 per cent. What is happening in Canada? The Federal Government there is actually looking at reducing the 7 per cent consumption tax because there has been such a reaction. In fact, people are going over the border to do their shopping in the United States because they cannot cope with the impact of a consumption tax of 7 per cent, or 7 per cent plus 6 per cent in some States, which is 13 per cent. Here in Australia the coalition is still wedded to this idea that a 15 per cent consumption tax is somehow just. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In John Hewson's consumption tax package he proposes that the agency should be abolished but without any impact on the legislative guarantees of equal employment opportunity. Somehow it is going to be absorbed into the Department, which will already be overloaded. There will be severe cutbacks, because the whole philosophy of the Opposition is to have cutbacks in the public sector. Yet somehow the Affirmative Action Agency, which is there doing a good job now, is supposed to do the same job over in the Department, which will be under-resourced. It simply does not make sense. Exactly the same thing applies in relation to the coalition's cost-cutting proposals for the Department of Industrial Relations. That would have the effect of abolishing the equal pay and work and family units of that Department.

We will be looking to the overseas experience in regard to the consumption tax. We will be looking at the $10 billion cuts the Opposition proposes for the public sector. We will be looking at things such as the cessation of the sole parent pension when the youngest child turns 12, which would enable the Opposition to make savings of $115m. What about the restriction of pension eligibility to wives of disability support pensioners? In that regard the Opposition would make savings of $199.3m.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to my question on Monday about jobs for women in the economic statement, Senator Button said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the statement talks about people, not men or women. There is nothing specified in relation to men or women in the statement.</PARA>
<PARA>This is perfectly true and it is precisely this aspect of the statement about which we are critical. It appears that the statement has forgotten the fact that Australia has one of the most highly sex segregated work forces in the world and, despite the claims of 800,000 jobs in four years, we really question whether this will go towards meeting the tremendous needs plainly evident in the female work force. This is why the Australian Democrats will be supporting this motion moved by the Opposition today, in conjunction with an amendment to highlight the failure of the Government's policies in helping to break down gender barriers in the work force and improve the participation of women in non-traditional areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the week of International Women's Day 1992, it is an astonishing fact that Australia has one of the most sex segregated work forces of all its OECD counterparts. Nearly a decade since the Federal sex discrimination Acts were codified the situation for women in the work force has little improved. We are facing the lack of success of many of the Government's affirmative action policies as women remain clustered in traditional professions which are mainly low skilled, low paid and low value areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, 76 per cent of all clerical positions are held by women; 64 per cent of all jobs in retail sales are held by women; and women are still clustered in teaching, nursing, community services and certain sections of manufacturing. On the other hand, less than 12 per cent of all full time managerial positions are held by women. When I read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> document it was with a growing sense of despair that I saw that once again the Government had failed to address the severe problem of female unemployment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Male unemployment is well catered for. The Government is to spend millions on massive infrastructure projects&mdash;railways, roads, wharves and airports&mdash;and to that the Democrats have no objection. However, it must be clear to even the most disinterested person that the building industry is not a major employer of women but it does employ men from unskilled labour to the architect. This is not to say, however, that women are incapable of holding jobs in these fields. Albeit slowly, more and more women are moving into these areas. My colleague Senator Bourne, for example, is an architect by training and I am no stranger to heavy work and dirty hands in the archaeological field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So how large is the problem? The number of discouraged job seekers as at September 1991 increased by a whopping 37 per cent to 138,200 and 75 per cent of these were women. The ABS has another category, not in the labour force, comprising people who may like to work but who are not actually looking for work or immediately available to start. As at September last year these people numbered over 3,643,000 and some 68 per cent of these were women. Of the 819,300 people who indicated a preference for part time work, 73 per cent were women and 41 per cent of these said family reasons were preventing them from actively seeking work; 77 per cent of these people said their reasons were child-care related. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Repeatedly, areas such as child-care and maternity leave are identified as the biggest impediments to women's participation in the work force, yet they are so easily remedied and not addressed in the economic statement. There is little point to women entering traditional areas of male work if they are going to be sacked if they become pregnant, denied maternity leave, discouraged from applying for entitlements, unable to find child-care places or find that the cost of child-care is prohibitive. I remind the Government that the Labour Council in New South Wales&mdash;the paradigm of labour market relations in New South Wales&mdash;actually sacked two women who were on approved maternity leave. Senator West holds her head in shame, and so she should. It must have been the worst example of labour relations in New South Wales; not to mention the five other workers who also got the sack. So much for consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where benefits exist women should be encouraged to apply and to exercise their rights to child-care. Why is it that fewer than half the women in Victoria who are entitled to maternity leave take it even though it has been built into awards for more than 10 years? Many of these women are unaware of their rights. However, many unions fail to alert women to these rights, and female membership rates in unions are low and the senior ranks are still male dominated. Industries are quick to whine about any attempts to improve working conditions for women. A survey conducted by Price Waterhouse shows fewer than half of the industries are interested in affirmative action programs and around 15 per cent are willing to offer child-care facilities. The same survey showed that 30 per cent of men actually resented affirmative action initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women still only earn 80 per cent of male average weekly earnings, and 81.7 per cent of earning males work full time and a full year compared with 46.4 per cent of women. This is because the major proportion of women have another almost full time job&mdash;wife, mother and partner. This restricts their ability to conform to the male idea of job structure. The male idea of a career path is full time work, full year work, mobility to follow career opportunities and no outside work responsibilities. None of this applies to most women and this inability to slot into the expected role discriminates against them. The above figures proves this. A valuable resource is being wasted and the Government is blinded by the big picture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what measures are being taken by the Government to address the problem of female unemployment? Where are the jobs for women in the economic statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)? Given the sex segregated nature of the work force where are the jobs for women in road and rail construction, infrastructure support and public works?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn to a large employer of women, the textile, clothing and footwear industry. In that industry 65 per cent of the employees are women, and yet this sector of the economy has suffered massive job losses over the last 18 months. Some 30,000 jobs have been lost in the TCF industry as a result of restructuring forced on the industry by this Government, which seems bent on making sure Australia competes on a level playing field even when hardly anyone overseas is doing the same thing. These jobs will not suddenly re-emerge when the recession is over. They are permanently lost and there is no guarantee that the slack will be taken up by the 200,000 jobs to be created in the tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats fully support the TCF union in its call for a freeze on quota levels and out of quota duty rates in 1992, and a review of the tariff phase-down. The economic statement promises an augmented TCF industry development strategy to help existing firms restructure, but no change to its relentless policy of tariff reduction which has severely damaged Australia's manufacturing base. There is no real help or jobs in the statement for women who are employed in the TCF industry. As it stands, many women will have to wait for the expected private sector recovery, which will hopefully create jobs in sales, clerical and manufacturing sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as I said earlier, the absence in the economic statement of jobs for women can be partly traced back to structural inequalities in the workplace and the sex segregated nature of the work force. The ABS claims that the over $7,000 difference in earnings for full-time males and females was partly related to differences in educational and occupational characteristics. Clearly, more educational opportunities for women and girls in non-traditional fields will in the long term enable women to benefit from work creation programs in public infrastructure projects, engineering and related fields. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education is seen as a key factor in achieving equality between men and women. A 1985 Schools Commission report during International Women's Year concluded that, overall, females were educationally disadvantaged and sexism was pervasive in our school system. Equal opportunity legislation designed to improve educational opportunities for women, hence employment prospects for women, has not succeeded in achieving equal participation on a secondary level or specifically at a tertiary level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The imbalance in women's participation is determined by a number of factors. These include choice of matriculation subjects, masculinist curricula, a lack of mentors, a lack of self-confidence, parenting responsibilities and financial problems. These are all important factors underlying the participation of women in higher education and mirror the obstacles in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women's participation in the higher education sector is gradually improving, despite financial disincentives, which include fees in the form of HECS, and inadequate student financial assistance. Once in education institutions, women encounter problems such as a lack of child-care facilities, inadequate safety and security provisions and gender exclusive curriculum. Women now comprise 53 per cent of undergraduate enrolments, yet their participation begins to diminish at a postgraduate level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of those women enrolled in undergraduate degrees, at least 50 per cent are concentrated in traditional areas such as nursing, arts and education. This clustering is specific to women, whereas men are more evenly spread among all faculties. This sets a pattern for women in the work force and their subsequent concentration in lower paid, lower skilled and lower valued areas. In non-traditional areas such as engineering, in many institutions women represent less than 10 per cent of enrolments on all degree levels and average 10.1 per cent in Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past decade women have increased their participation at the honours degree level. However, there is still significant attrition of female students beyond the honours year in most disciplines. The number of female postgraduates studying for higher degrees and PhDs is less than half of that of male postgraduates. One influence of women's participation in education is the limited role models in academia with less than 10 per cent of senior academic positions and professorships held by women. Women tend to be untenured, part-time, and working as tutor staff, junior assistants and sub-lecturers. On average only 20 per cent of research and teaching positions are held by women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Successful participation in university education is a necessary step towards entry into a wide range of professional careers, including academic research and teaching. Until education opportunities for women are expanded, women's access to the work force is somewhat limited. What incentives are there for women to enter higher education with the paucity of student financial assistance available?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women with children are specifically disadvantaged when the maximum Austudy rate available to them is $165.20 per week. That represents a measly $8,638 for them and their dependants to survive on per year. The imbalance between earned income for women and men is also reflected in student incomes. A recent study into student finances demonstrates that women receive $36 less per week than their male counterparts in the higher education system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the decade the gender imbalance in higher education has remained resistant to legislative action. Any attempts to introduce financial barriers to participation in education will hit hard at traditionally disadvantaged groups such as women. Certainly, this will not be helped by the Opposition's policy of introducing vouchers and what effectively will be fees for higher education. I believe that this will lead significantly to a return to the pre-Whitlam days when families could only afford to educate one member of their family, which usually was the eldest son. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation economic statement and the GST provide no new opportunities for women's increased participation in the higher education system and fail to outline positive measures in the provision of on-campus child-care or boosts to students assistance that would remove some of the obstacles that prevent women's participation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only jobs that appear to be created for women in the One Nation package are those in the tourism industry. We certainly do not have any argument with job creation in that sector. However, I would point to an inconsistency in the Government's package. The Government is suggesting that 800,000 jobs will be created over four years. Yet if one turns to page 88 of the One Nation document, one sees:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the next eight years international tourism to Australia is forecast to more than double and 200,000 new jobs could be generated.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like the Government to explain&mdash;and this is a genuine question&mdash;whether the 200,000 jobs that will be created are included</PARA>
<PARA>in the 800,000 jobs which are to be created over the next four years. What relationship do the 200,000 jobs in the tourism industry to be created over the next decade bear to the 800,000 jobs which are mentioned elsewhere in the statement to be created over the next four years? That is a very genuine question that we would ask in view of the tourism projections contained in the package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, quite clearly the Government has placed a great deal of faith in the marketplace to create jobs for women in those industries where they are traditionally segregated. So has the Opposition for that matter, as it has adopted a position removing government even further from economic activity. It believes that policies of economic rationalism will deliver the correct social outcomes, which they will not. Senator Reynolds has already outlined the disastrous effects that labour market deregulation could have on women in the work force, especially those who are in non-unionised sectors of the work force. The Government has failed on all counts in the economic statement to deliver any hope for women and should be justly condemned for ignoring a group that is making an enormous contribution to the paid and unpaid work force. </PARA>

If they are so significant and so important, why did he miss the boat? He is now making the statement on Sunday because he realises that he missed the boat. That is the issue. The One Nation&mdash;the `One Job'&mdash;package, the Keating job package of this Labor Government, fails to take the necessary bold measures either to increase the employment prospects of younger women or to assist those women who are operating small businesses. Sadly, there are very few people on the Labor side who understand the significance of women&mdash;or anyone, for that matter&mdash;operating small businesses. The only businesses that can probably be disguised in this instance are funny businesses.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While female unemployment rates in a recession are less than the male unemployment rates, women are far greater losers when it comes to underemployment&mdash;the desire to work more hours than are available. Unfortunately, the underemployed are suffering during this depression.

There are many women whose only way of getting back into the work force is to get into TAFE and learn more skills to qualify themselves for the work force. Does this Government care? No. There is not one mention of this in the silly One Nation, `One Job', package. It is a shame that Mr Keating did not consider the plight of women&mdash;the young women, the women underemployed in their occupations&mdash;instead of his own job and his own residency at the Lodge. </PARA>

We will hear screams of `That is exploitation', ignoring the very special fact that within 12 to 18 months employers would need to move to award wages.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The job increases over the last eight years have included nearly one million women. Traineeships have had a high proportion of success amongst women. Higher education now sees 52 per cent of women students. Superannuation, which I understand Senator Newman managed to skirt around without saying anything particularly useful, is for the first time  available for many women. Extension of award superannuation has occurred over the last few years. Amendment of the Sex Discrimination Act has removed exemptions which affected women. We are now legislating for a superannuation guaranteed levy. These are many very solid and concrete examples of our concern for women. We will continue to be concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to address a number of the misapprehensions of some of the previous speakers, specifically Senator Knowles' reference to what she said was our total inability to achieve any sort of work force change. The Opposition seems once again to have completely ignored the impressive list of workplace agreements within the managed consensual system which this Government and our unions have built together. This the honourable senator managed to completely gloss over, to utterly ignore. These agreements include places where large numbers of women are employed, such as the Commonwealth Bank, Ansett Airlines, Johnson and Johnson, ACI Fibreglass, BHP, Hoover, Australian Airlines, Brambles, Alcan, Kelloggs, Bridgestone, Pacific Dunlop and Rheem, just to mention a few. So much for the accusation that there has been no restructuring in the work force, no capacity for workers to negotiate their own conditions, endorsed and monitored by an effective and an efficient industrial relations system which the Opposition, like the New Zealanders, would like to completely demolish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like briefly to address Senator Sowada's amendment regarding the package's alleged failure to address the segregation of women in the work force with the result that Australia remains the most segregated work force in the OECD. We have known that for quite a long time. That sex segregation has been gradually diminishing over the years because of the measures that have been taken since 1983 by the Hawke Government and now by the Keating Government to try to redress the situation. It is not so long ago that when the Australian Statistician took out common award wages he looked at 2,500 common awards for males and 500 common awards for females, to give you some idea of the quite drastic segregation that previously applied within the Australian work force. We should also look at other ways in which we line up with the OECD and recognise that we have moved closer to genuine equal wages for women than any other OECD country. We are doing considerably better for a number of reasons, most of which go to the consensual nature of the Australian industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to concentrate for a moment or two on what a Keating-led Labor Government will not do, issues which are either explicit or implicit in the coalition's Fightback package. One of the things we will not do is follow the confrontationist, worker hostile, union bashing, harsh and punitive formula of the coalition's Fightback, or some call it dieback, strategies. We will not be abolishing or diminishing the structures that protect the rights of women and women unionists. We will not be diminishing or removing structures such as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. In fact, we are planning to expand it to cover other issues. We will not be diminishing or abolishing the Affirmative Action Agency. Despite Senator Newman's protestations, I refer honourable senators to chapter 16, page 268 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">!</EMPHASIS> document, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further savings will be achieved by reducing the running costs of Comcare by 15 per cent and abolishing the Affirmative Action Agency.</PARA>
<PARA>These are the very words in Senator Newman's own document. We will not be following the New Zealand road to anarchy by stripping the Industrial Arbitration Commission of most of its functions and leaving the workers to try to survive the most blatant version of industrial Darwinism this country would ever have seen. We will not deny women workers the support and protection of unions. I draw attention to the fact that women are joining unions in greater proportions than they have done for some years. We will not deny unions the right to negotiate on behalf of the workers. We will not abolish junior rates. We will not be giving employers the right to discard workers&mdash;amongst whom women are the most vulnerable, especially if they happen to be young or Aboriginal or from a non-English speaking background&mdash;who refuse to accept wage cuts, no penalty rates and generally inferior conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We certainly do not intend to carry out a slash and burn job to social security payments, as the New Zealand Government&mdash;which the Opposition admires so much&mdash;has done. Further, we certainly do not intend to coerce women and other vulnerable workers into accepting inferior working conditions by imposing lengthy qualifying conditions and other harsh conditions such as have been introduced in New Zealand which the Opposition, understandably, identifies as very close to its own ideology. Most of all, we shall certainly not be encumbering Australian women workers, consumers and parents with a 15 per cent tax on practically every purchase and transaction which would increase the cost of clothing, food, electricity and health charges and make losers of something like 60 to 70 per cent of households in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most important changes over the last few years, and certainly one of our continuing measures to make life for working women and families with children a great deal more palatable&mdash;the single greatest liberating factor which, incidentally, provides a considerable amount of employment; it is very labour intensive&mdash;is children's services. I would like to emphasise that access and affordability, which are our principles, are likely to go out the window under the principles, such as they are, in the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our own standards are illustrated by the fact that since 1983 the number of places in children's services has increased from 46,000 to 177,000 which, at December 1991, accommodated 284,000 children. This is an enormous increase on what was left for the women and families of Australia in 1983. Funding has risen four-fold to $370m in 1991-92 and the expansion program continues. Fee relief eligibility has expanded from 49,000 families to 130,000 families in 1992, partly as a result of being extended to users of approved commercial centres. This is a great leap forward in providing horizontal equity for those people who were unable to get access to the community centres which, at that point, were the only ones receiving subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback proposition would increase by 14 per cent the gap between what people are currently paying and what they would be required to pay for children's services under a coalition government. I have reduced that figure from 15 to 14 per cent to allow for the fact that wholesale sales tax is to be removed. As I have said before, wholesale sales tax is not a very substantial proportion of the costs of child-care, which is very heavily labour intensive. A 14 per cent increase would be the equivalent of about $17 a week on the cost of caring for each child. One can just imagine how that would be used as an excuse for failing to expand the number of child-care centres, diminishing access and affordability&mdash;which are things that we have stuck to religiously over the years&mdash;and possibly reducing standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very many issues that could be covered in talking about the enhancement of the status of women in Australia over the last eight or nine years. As I commented only two or three days ago, the measures taken in this country are seen as a model by many parts of the world. They are emulated, praised and admired. Over the years we have ensured that our policies and our platforms have developed, that the programs have been enhanced in order to improve accessibility; improve affordability for services; and expand the opportunities for women to train, to be included in the work force and to enhance their qualifications. Contrary to what has been accused, our One Nation statement includes a wide range of measures which will greatly improve the opportunity of women to either lift&mdash;</PARA>

Finally&mdash;it has been said three or four times this afternoon but obviously has not sunk in&mdash;women have been increasingly represented, very successfully, in small business.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to participate in this debate. I would have thought that if the Government had any concern or feeling for women's employment or employment generally it might have got someone on its front bench to participate in the debate. The Government might have shown this matter a bit of seriousness and might have indicated to the Australian public that it does consider important employment opportunities for women and for men and for youth. But what do we have? We have three junior players speaking on the issue; we do not have one from the front bench making any contribution to this very serious debate. I suppose it typifies the ALP's attitude towards women's employment and employment generally. The ALP pays it lip-service; it has all the pretty socialist phrases; it makes all the right noises; but, in seriousness, when it comes down to the real things it does nothing. It cannot even give this very important issue the credibility of having a member of its front bench deal with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I suppose that when we look at the front bench we can understand why the ALP does not have anyone participating in this debate. Again, it talks big about equal opportunities; it talks big about employment for women; but we do not see anyone in a skirt on the front bench over there on the other side of the chamber. So, again, it is a case of talk big, make a show of it, but when it comes to action what does it do? It does absolutely nothing. This is another pathetic display of absolute hypocrisy of the ALP in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is well worth contrasting the lack of any measures in the `Kickback' or the `One Job' statement that Mr Keating has issued with the many, many measures in the coalition's Fightback package. The statement by Mr Keating had a very deliberate, anti-rural, anti-regional bias. Thirty-three of Australia's 37 poorest Federal electorates are situated in rural Australia and those are the communities which are almost completely ignored by the economic statement. How many jobs in regional Australia, in north Queensland, will result from the $1.79 billion worth of projects outlined in this statement which are outside the rural and regional and remote areas of Australia? How many people will share in that benefit?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can Mr Keating seriously believe that he can pay for his spending spree without putting it all on Bankcard for our children and grandchildren to repay? That $1.79 billion attempt to create these jobs in the city areas will cost all Australians some $223 per year. Keep in mind that our foreign debt is already something like $8,000 for every man, woman and child. It makes one laugh when one reads what Mr Keating said about this on 23 January 1990. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In three years there will be no government debt, domestic or external. It's an enormous claim that I can make on behalf of the Government of Australia and I doubt there is any other OECD country that will not have any bonds on issue at all.</PARA>
<PARA>The government debt that is there for every man, woman and child in Australia makes an absolute mockery of that. Some of Mr Keating's other statements are equally ludicrous. His statement `This one brings home the bacon' is one of the 15 statements that has failed. On 19 September 1987 Mr Keating said, `This is the great coming of age of Australia. This is the golden age of economic change'. The journalist said, `How much credit do you take?', and Mr Keating said, `Oh, a very large part'. Look at the great economic change we have had: one million people unemployed and the country continuing to go down the gurgler. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the $2.3 billion that Mr Keating is spending, a mere $23m is coming to my part of the world and very precious little else is coming to other parts of rural and regional Australia. How many women does the ALP expect will be employed on the two projects in the Townsville area to increase a road and to build a port? There will not be many jobs for women there. How many jobs out of the whole package will be created in Mount Isa, Cairns, Mackay, Broken Hill and the other remote areas such as Alice Springs? How many jobs for women does the ALP really believe will be created by spending $2 billion on road, rail and airport construction? How many jobs for women will there be in regional Australia because of Mr Keating's better cities program? How many jobs will regional women get out of that? How many do they expect will be created in regional and remote Australia as a result of any of these programs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the ALP can do about women in remote and regional areas is attempt to introduce things like daylight saving, which shows a complete disregard for the wishes of women and families in those areas. When the Government is forced, by a Queensland recommendation, to change its view it does so not because it is helping women and families but purely and simply as a political and cynical vote winning exercise. All those Labor members in rural and regional seats&mdash;Mr Gayler, Mr  Hulls, Mr Lindsay and Mr Wright&mdash;voted for that Commonwealth takeover of daylight saving when it was in the lower House, but now because they think that they are going to lose some votes they have changed their minds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will the tax cuts do for people in rural and regional Australia, the women who have to work both on and off the farm to keep businesses afloat? Those who earn less than $20,700&mdash;which is a vast majority of the working women in regional and remote Australia&mdash;are told by this Government in this statement, `You have already had some sort of tax cut; you have already had some benefits in the past. We are not going to look after you this time. There will be nothing for you'. I point out that most farmers fall into the category of receiving less than $20,700 at the present time. Also, some 30 per cent of farmers are women&mdash;women who will bear the brunt of this Government's failure to do anything for people in that lower income bracket. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> was supposed to fix the pain caused by the recession, but most of the spending measures that are proposed are not just around the corner but halfway down the road to Argentina. That is what is wrong with this particular statement. The 1994 tax cuts exclude those people earning under $20,700 and those people struggling to keep a farm or a country town small business alive through the worst recession in 60 years&mdash;the Keating recession, the one he said we had to have. The city spending spree upon which Keating has embarked is completely irrelevant to the people of remote and regional Australia. It is worth while to compare the Labor tax cuts with those in the Fightback package which give real relief to lower income groups. Those earning under $20,000 have their income tax reduced from 20 per cent to 16.2 per cent. Those earning under $7,000&mdash;and by gee there are a lot of them nowadays&mdash;will pay no tax at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the greatest things that has affected those in rural and regional Australia, particularly women, is the fuel excise rip-off perpetrated by this Government which the Fightback package will do away with. Labor has increased fuel excise by 120 per cent since 1983 and has decreased road funding by 20 per cent. Under the Fightback package, the people of remote and rural Australia will benefit tremendously from the abolition of excise, and that will have an enormous impact in remote and regional Australia, particularly on women. Women in remote and regional Australia have further to drive their kids to partake in sport and tuition and to get to educational and health facilities. They have to drive many, many kilometres. The fact that they will be paying $11 less per tank of petrol will be of enormous benefit to women in remote and rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wholesale sales tax, which imposts so much on freight, and then because of that affects the remote and rural areas of Australia, is also something which the economic statement failed to address but which the Fightback package very clearly and positively addresses. What is needed, rather than having spending sprees on public infrastructure in the capital cities, is for incentive to be given to Australians to create real jobs that women can take part in and that will encourage them to go back into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My time has been curtailed but there are many things that the Fightback package does which the economic statement does not do. There is a tremendous increase in family allowances under the Fightback package, rather than this fairly cynical, Victorian by-election, $125 one-off payment which, as many people have pointed out, would barely buy a decent pair of shoes for the kids. The sole parent benefit goes up under us. Sole parent transition work allowance goes up. The dependent spouse rate goes up. None of this is allowed for in the economic statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the zone rebate, which will have a tremendous impact on rural women, there is big relief in the Fightback package; nothing under Mr Keating. In health, women in rural and regional areas will benefit by having access to densitometry and mammography tests. There is nothing about that in Mr Keating's statement. Enormous things are being done for women. I am sure that Senator Reynolds will be so embarrassed when she realises that women unemployed now total 10.1 per cent of the work force, in spite of the fact that back in 1989 she was criticising people for an unemployment rate of 6.6 per cent. </PARA>

That is not an issue that the Opposition cares to canvass terribly much. The Opposition ignores the fact that, where there are several different wage structures operating, including the youth wage, in some industries when people reach the ripe old age of 18 it is not uncommon for employers to put them off because it is cheaper to employ someone who is under that age.

However, it will not be possible to make totally self-funding the areas that Senator MacDonald wanted to talk about&mdash;but did not address, of course&mdash;namely, the rural and remote areas which are not as affluent.

We need to remember that 70 per cent of employees in that area are women. I would hasten to add that somewhere around 30 per cent of those are in management positions. They are not, as we have heard from the Opposition, all down making the beds, but they are in important areas of management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to recognise that this has been the big growth industry in this country in the last ten years. Last year we saw a job growth in this area of 50,000 people. That is quite a large number. In the next decade we are expecting that 15 per cent of all jobs will be in this hospitality industry. That is one in six jobs.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made a significant contribution to tourism in this package. That has been totally ignored by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also add, while on the subject of tourism, that ten years ago less than 5 per cent of chefs were female.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also in tourism, in order to increase new projects, the amortisation rate on tourism income producing buildings will change from 2.5 per cent to 4 per cent. We have also changed the depreciation rates. There is no recognition of this at all by honourable senators opposite, because that does not suit them. But, of course, that affects employment in that industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am talking about tourism, I suggest that people think about what the GST will do to tourism, bearing in mind that most tourist facilities are small businesses, small employers, and therefore are not paying payroll tax. They will be hit by the GST. I have here an advertisement which appeared in the papers over Christmas for the Hyatt complex of hotels. It is very interesting to look at the prices. One knows precisely what one is going to pay in Adelaide, Perth and Sydney, but in Auckland one will pay NZ$172 plus 12.5 per cent GST. Of course, 12.5 per cent was not enough GST for New Zealand and it has gone up to 15 per cent. But that is the sort of thing that would happen. Every bill like this that one would get would have a GST stuck on it, and that would have a major impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also heard about small business today. I suggest that the majority of people in small businesses are women. Small business does not pay payroll tax. Yet we heard what a wonderful relief it was going to be for small business that it would not have to pay payroll tax. Small businesses already do not pay payroll tax. We also need to look at the impact of GST upon small business. We currently have about 70,000 businesses paying wholesale sales tax. But, with the introduction of GST, it would be at least 10 times that number&mdash;and most of the people affected would be small business people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That would increase their costs and their overheads because they would need to have somebody available actually able to help them with their GST, because it would be an extra workload. They would have to document it as it came in; they would have to document it as it went out. That, of course, would be a big impost upon small business, but that is completely forgotten by Opposition senators, as one would expect from them; they are selective in terms of what they talk about. I suggest also that if people want to know about the impact of GST upon women and small business, they should talk to small business operators in New Zealand.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I have been talking to the ones that have got out because they know that the situation is just so bad. The things that we are doing for small business are: a substantial increase in capital gains tax relief; a three-month extension for the 1991-92 company tax payments for small business; no increase until 1994-95 for the prescribed minimum superannuation levy for businesses with payrolls of $500,000 or less; and a tripling of funding support to $12m for assisting small and medium enterprises to enter export markets through export access programs. And that is not helping small business! It is an absolute furphy to suggest that this Government is not concerned about small business, the largest employer of people in this country. Those are the things that we are doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to suggest that, in looking at employment, we have to look also at education. We have seen a dramatic increase in the last eight years in the number of girls staying on at high school and the number of women entering university. The numbers of female entrants to university and female graduates are greater than for men. Those women, of course, must take their place in management as they work their way up in industries. Senator Sowada talked about sex segregation. That is nothing new to us people who have worked with the women's movement for a long time. It is something that was around for the 27 years out of 30 that honourable senators opposite were in government, and they did nothing about it. We have increased the number of women who have access to education and who are coming out with degrees and other qualifications that will enable them to get into the senior levels of management. That is certainly something that we are working on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was suggested also that road and rail measures&mdash;such as the initiatives for Brisbane-Sydney-Melbourne-Adelaide and beyond&mdash;will not help women. I suggest that people should think about what else goes on when something is being built. It is not just the people who manhandle the sleepers and the iron rails; it is also those people who actually do the surveying and the drafting of the plans. The women steelworkers at BHP in Wollongong&mdash;who managed after many years of struggle to beat the discriminatory qualification criteria for access to this sort of work with BHP&mdash;will benefit because the steel from BHP will go into those railway lines.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement by the Minister is described as being about the more efficient and effective delivery of client services by the Department of Social Security. That is an objective that we would all endorse. Indeed, it is highly desirable that the quality of service should continue to improve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, when one examines this statement closely, one sees that it would seem to have a lot more to do with improved job creation programs for the public sector and for the staff of the Department than with effectively improving service to clients. Probably the ultimate test of that is that in various places the statement deals with how the Department has coped well with the pressures of increasing numbers of people using DSS services. It says that there will be significant reductions in demand, and points to a number of services currently performed that will no longer need to be dealt with within regional offices because they can now be dealt with by a new service involving 11 teleservice centres being created throughout the nation each staffed by between 80 and 150 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said all that, when one would have expected that the end result would be the more efficient delivery of services and, therefore, less demand on current staffing, we find that there will be an increase in cost for the service. Therefore, one is entitled to conclude that this is really more of a recipe for an explosion in the delivery of services and an increase in the number of people to provide them than a recipe to ensure that clients are better served than they presently are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement envisages a significant expansion in the number of social workers and financial and investment service officers. It even contemplates spending a lot of time and effort in going out and drumming up business for the youth homeless allowance. I do not think any of us would argue that there are not quite a number of people in the community who are in desperate circumstances as a result of their domestic backgrounds and other factors causing them to be both young and homeless. However, there is absolutely nothing to suggest that a solution to the problem is, as Senator Richardson has portrayed it in the past, to embark on a massive advertising campaign to try to make people more aware of the fact that they are entitled to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not see this statement doing anything more than simply justifying the retention of current staffing numbers. It is, therefore, very disappointing that the most we get in terms of efficiency is some vacuous statement about the cost being $15m. In the longer term, the cost will be offset by productivity savings. If the Government were serious, it would have gone into a lot more detail. Therefore, I have to say that one should not at all assume that this will result in better service delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One only has to look at the Child Support Agency to discover probably the most grotesque example of service delivery gone wrong. It is probably the greatest fiasco in the history of Public Service delivery. It is replete with injustices and complaints&mdash;complaints of clients being ignored; being shunted between offices; being told to ring back; not being able to make contact in the first place; not being understood when they do make complaints; and being treated in a cavalier fashion. In view of that experience, one would have to be very wary of the effectiveness of this new scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that it has been trialled in Brisbane and that it is based on experience in the United States. I would have thought that we were entitled to many more indications of the safeguards which will be applied instead of it serving as a basis for simply jacking up the rates across the board, as this statement indicates will happen. It does not in any way follow that because the Government is restructuring the Department in this fashion, it is justified in creating new tiers and promoting people to higher levels.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly concerned about privacy in this area. Just recently&mdash;indeed, last month&mdash;6,000 people were sent information about banking accounts, security payments, income investments and assets. They received all sort of details relating to other people. The information was sent to the wrong people. In New South Wales 6,000 people were sent incorrect information&mdash;not their information, but information that related to strangers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Privacy Commissioner has suggested that the Department could introduce more human intervention in computer printer runs of 10,000 or 20,000. He said that this would require an employee to select letters randomly, at regular intervals, to ensure that errors do not occur. Has the Minister introduced this?  I would be most interested to know whether he has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that has not been the only occasion that this has happened. Last year, when Senator Richardson was Minister, 400 people were sent incorrect information. We have this continual problem in the Department of Social Security. We now have a new Minister. A dreadful mistake, a dreadful error, has been made under the new Minister in that 6,000 people sent the wrong information. The Minister in his paper says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . teleservice centres will be based on strict rules for the positive identification of callers and for client confidentiality and privacy.</PARA>
<PARA>That sounds pretty good, but what on earth are the strict rules for confidentiality?  We are not told what they are. The Minister also says that the caller will need to satisfy proof of identity procedures before any information is provided by the DSS operator. But again in the Minister's statement there is no detail whatsoever of how this is to come about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Privacy Commissioner has made some suggestions about how the Department could fix the problems it has already. We are to move into a new telephone service where I think privacy will be a much greater problem. The Minister, Dr Blewett, says that the Department has worked very hard to find the cause of and to rectify the 6,000 wrongly directed pieces of information. But he has not said in his paper what action was taken, whether the Department has accepted the Privacy Commissioner's recommendation or whether it has done virtually nothing at all. The Privacy Commissioner also suggested, as we all know, that compensation would be appropriate in some cases. But the Minister ruled that out very specifically, saying that it was not appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A problem that I have with our new Minister is that I do not believe that philosophically he has the sort of concern about privacy that should be the ultimate objective of a Minister who is in charge of the Department of Social Security. Senator Richardson used to tell us how concerned he was; we now have Dr Blewett telling us how concerned he is. But for the 6,000 people who received inaccurate information&mdash;who received very accurate information about other people but not about their own circumstances&mdash;it was not acceptable. We all remember how Dr Blewett carried on. We remember him saying, `This will not happen again' and `We will take action'. He has not explained in his paper what action he has taken to make sure that this does not happen again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We only have to look at that Minister's history to see how genuine and sincere he is in his comments about this type of occurrence being unacceptable. We only have to go back six or seven years to a statement he made at the ALP State Conference in South Australia. This is what Dr Blewett said at that time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me say as a Socialist that it is the interests of the community that should come before individual rights. . . we shouldn't get too hung up as Socialists on privacy, because privacy, in many ways is a bourgeois right that is very much associated with the right to private property.</PARA>
<PARA>That was not very long ago. And I do not believe this Minister has changed his general philosophy as a socialist one iota&mdash;not one iota. He has carried on in a way to make people believe that he is interested in privacy. But in the confidentiality of an ALP conference, he really made it very clear that socialists should not get too hung on up on privacy `because privacy, in many ways is a bourgeois right that is very much associated with the right to private property'. I do not think any of the Social Security recipients whose information was sent to someone else would agree with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is because of my concern that the Minister of this portfolio lacks all credibility when it comes to privacy that this statement is of great interest to me. The teleservice centres will, I believe, create even more problems for privacy. I would like to be assured that privacy will be able to be maintained if these teleservice centres are to be brought in. Also, I would like to know how privacy is to be maintained. As I say, there is absolutely nothing whatsoever in this paper about privacy or how privacy will be protected. This subject is only talked about in very general terms. I believe that the Senate needs to have the detail before we will go along with anything that the Minister is suggesting to us. As I say, the cost will be $15m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The credibility of this Minister is non-existent when it comes to privacy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Five million Australians are receiving payments from the Department of Social Security. The fact that the Department is being forced to introduce teleservice, referred to in the ministerial statement, is an indictment of the Government's economic policies. It is proof of the massive human hardship being caused by the recession deliberately engineered by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;the recession he said we had to have. It shows that the Department of Social Security is no longer able to handle the massive increase in welfare recipients, with double digit unemployment and half a million further underemployed Australians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a good question. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> is our solution, to create jobs so that we do not have these great queues in Social Security offices. That is our solution, but I will not be diverted from the main course at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the great sensitivity of the DSS in making the results from its operational performance monitoring systems available to the public, it is virtually impossible for either the public or for us as politicians to find out how long those queues are, how long people have to wait on the telephone, and how many problems exist when clients actually do get to see Social Security officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have found it very difficult to ascertain whether staff are managing to attain the performance standards set by the Department. Thankfully, the Auditor-General in his report to the Parliament yesterday recommended that standards of timeliness and quality should be made public as soon as is practicably possible. In the statement the Minister says that he will follow through and take up this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the Minister's estimate that DSS numbers will continue to rise, the Government has been forced to introduce this teleservice system to overcome the queues. I agree wholeheartedly with the objective of reducing the queues but not necessarily with the way in which it is being done. I have doubts whether the teleservice proposal in this ministerial statement has been properly researched and trialled, and whether sufficient consultation with interested and affected parties has been undertaken by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have reason to believe that this is a hastily put together initiative. The Department conducted a teleservice trial in Brisbane. This trial redirected telephone calls made to regional offices to a teleservice centre. Obviously the majority of those calls would have been of a general inquiry nature. That is a far cry from the proposed teleservice system which is being put in place and which will undertake many of the day to day administrative duties normally carried out in DSS regional offices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it had been ensured that such a major change in the administration of the social security system is to be conducted efficiently and fairly, I would have reasonably expected that significant consultation with relevant people in the community would have been undertaken. I have grave doubts as to whether this has occurred. This change seems to have been sprung on the Parliament; in fact, it was not even tabled in the Senate. That is the attitude of the Government to this House. This information was not even tabled here, where we have the shadow Minister for social security. The Opposition has had to table it. The change was sprung on the Parliament, sprung on the general public, and sprung on the users of the service. I cannot find any mention of this change in the latest annual report of the DSS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I am concerned, from our side of politics, there have been no efforts to consult parliamentarians, to whom people with concerns about Social Security go. I and many of my colleagues have had people make representations on some of the problems that have been associated with Social Security regional offices. There has been no consultation with us. The change has major privacy and confidentiality implications, as Senator Walters said. But I question the extent of consultation with the Privacy Commissioner and civil liberties groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Teleservice also has very important legal implications in terms of evidentiary requirements, but I wonder about the extent of consultation with legal groups. Did DSS consult with welfare groups, self-help groups and community organisations before it announced this change? Did the Department consult with Austel about the implications of a telecommunications-based benefit administration system? What is the extent of the DSS study of similar initiatives in the United States and overseas countries?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its consultations with all these groups, has DSS pointed out the problems it has identified in relation to this proposal and how it intends to overcome these problems? In an endeavour to answer these questions in the short time we have had&mdash;we received the document at 11.30 a.m.&mdash;I have done some research. I have made some preliminary inquiries on the degree of consultation that has taken place on the teleservice proposal. The findings are staggering and interesting. ACOSS knew nothing about it, except for seeing a media article reporting Dr Blewett. I was directed to the Welfare Rights Centre in Brisbane, where the trial occurred, by the welfare rights people. That centre advised that 70 per cent of its clients who used the trial teleservice system reported problems with it. I rang the office of the Privacy Commissioner. It was news to the people there; they had never seen it. So I faxed them a copy of the Minister's statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister in his statement says that the protection of client privacy has the highest priority in the Department. We have a complex system being introduced, with Department of Social Security officers running around with computers. I applaud Social Security for officers going out to the aged and the infirm&mdash;but with a portable computer with information on it? What are the privacy implications of that if the computer is lost or the car is stolen or whatever?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are never ending claims by Government Ministers that they are constantly liaising with the Privacy Commissioner. I believe that the Privacy Commissioner should be at arm's length from the Government, but not so far away that the Commissioner does not even know what is going on; not so far away that the Privacy Commissioner has to be informed by a member of the Opposition that a paper is being tabled which has some privacy implications and should be commented on by the Privacy Commissioner. When we contacted Beverley Schurr from the New South Wales Council of Civil Liberties, she said she did not have a clue what we were talking about. When we rang Austel, a spokesman there did not have a clue about the proposal either. In fact, I could not find one person with whom the Government had consulted about this important change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must not be forgotten that five million Australians will be affected by this change. It is not a paltry number of people. Nearly one-third of our population will be affected by this change. Amongst all those important groups I could find no-one who had been consulted, and the welfare rights group in Brisbane found that 70 per cent of its clients had some concerns about the teleservice trial. It makes me concerned about the proposal the Minister is putting before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians and this Parliament have a right to know whether the Government has thought through this proposal sufficiently, whether it has consulted with welfare representatives, whether there will be sufficient standards to protect recipients from bureaucratic incompetence, inefficiency and, in some cases&mdash;and I must say very limited cases, as the ICAC demonstrated&mdash;dishonesty. There is no evidence of any such assurances. Five million Australians are being asked again to trust the Department of Social Security, to take it on face value. They are being asked to trust the same Department that sends to thousands of recipients not their own financial details but details and information about other people. They are being asked to trust a department that sends letters to dead people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This ministerial statement and the relevant attachment are sadly short on the details of the teleservice system. In fact, rather than explaining how this system will work, the consultation that has occurred and how clients' interests will be protected, it reads more like a public relations document to promote the advantages of the teleservice system. I believe that there will be major teething problems entailed in the introduction of this system&mdash;teething problems that this ministerial statement either fails to recognise or, more likely, refused to recognise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where do social security clients turn if they find themselves unfairly treated as a result of this teleservice system? Probably they will turn to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal or to the Commonwealth Ombudsman. I wonder whether the Social Security Appeals Tribunal or the Ombudsman have been consulted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to outline some of the teething problems I foresee in the teleservice system. There is the problem of evidence when deciding disputes between DSS and its clients resulting from administrative action that may or may not have been taken as a result of information provided to a teleservice centre. Will clients know to whom they are providing, for example, changes of circumstance and bank account information? What will happen if the DSS officer at the other end of the telephone does not take the action required and a client is overpaid? Whose word will be good? No doubt what might be said is, `I telephoned, I told DSS that my income status had changed, but it is my word against that of the DSS officer that I have made the phone call'. How will that be recorded? How will we know? Will the person concerned be accused of receiving overpayments and of not advising the Department of a change in income status?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens if the telephone operator mistakenly actions the wrong file? Will all telephone conversations be taped? How will the record be kept of the fact that a DSS client has contacted the Department? Will clients be informed that if they do not receive written confirmation of the action taken they should immediately contact their DSS regional office? When they make the phone call, how will they be sure that action has been taken on that phone call? At least when they go into the office, somebody fills out a form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can Australians be 100 per cent confident that all teleservice operators will have the knowledge and capabilities to handle the wide variety of inquiries they will receive from clients and from would-be clients? After all, it is much easier to hide one's ignorance over the telephone rather than face to face. Can DSS ensure that the client on the other end of the phone is actually the person that they purport to be? How can DSS protect its clients from fraudulent operators who seek to use the teleservice system for their own financial gain?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other operational and privacy concerns. Will 100-long queues in DSS offices just be replaced by 100-long telephone queues and constantly engaged numbers? We know of other departments where people spend hours hanging on the end of a telephone. Will people who prefer face to face contact or who are wary about having their benefits administered over the phone still receive the same attention at regional offices that they do now? Or will they be shunted to the back of the queue because they are inquiring about matters which can be directed to teleservice? Will clients, their advocates and politicians for that matter, still be able to ring DSS regional offices? Will they now be forced to go through the teleservice centre regardless of whether their inquiry relates to a matter that can be handled by a teleservice operator?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that many Australians will be extremely concerned that between 80 and 150 DSS officers in 11 teleservice centres will have access to the files of every DSS client. At the touch of a computer keyboard they will be able to access that information. Many may be even more concerned about DSS officers walking around the streets or driving around in their cars with lap-top computers containing data about untold numbers of DSS clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One final important point must be made. This teleservice initiative is really up-market, high technology stuff as far as developing a faceless, heartless bureaucracy is concerned. For years people from all walks of life have criticised Social Security&mdash;not always justly&mdash;for not caring about its clients and treating them as nothing more than numbers to be herded through the system. I reiterate that that is not always the case. In fact, many people have resorted to voluntary agencies and to religious and to community groups because there is a perception that Social Security does not seem to care about the pain, the hardship and the lack of self-esteem. One wonders whether that will increase as a result of shifting the problem further away from the counter face onto a faceless and impersonal telephone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This teleservice initiative reveals the direction in which Labor is taking the Department of Social Security in the 1990s&mdash;a faceless, heartless assembly line which has the sole task of redistributing public money to the unfortunate victims of what has been the worst recession in 60 years brought upon us by the current Prime Minister. </PARA>

It is the strong view of the Australian Democrats that such statements should be laid before both Houses. This is a statement of considerable significance. The fact that the Government had intended this statement simply to be dealt with in the House of Representatives today and at some future time that it would percolate up to the Senate is an indictment of the Government's approach to this important area of service provision by the Department of Social Security. That is why we supported the Opposition's action in forcing a debate or at least some comment on this report today, on the same day as the statement has been tabled in the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome one aspect of the statement, and that is some indication of desperately needed action to improve the service delivery by the DSS to its ever-increasing clientele. We believe it is high time that such action was taken. </PARA>
<PARA>I have been the social security spokesperson for the Australian Democrats for several years going back to the second part of the 1980s. Complaints by people receiving social security payments were quite rampant about the poor quality of service that they were receiving. We can look to the House of Representatives whose Standing Committee on Community Affairs presented a report in May 1989, subsequent to a reference in February 1988. That Committee spent more than a year looking at the question of the quality of service provided by the DSS and presented to the Parliament a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fairness, courtesy and efficiency?</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report contained many important recommendations and revealed the extent of the need for change and improvement in the Department. I quote from that report of May 1989:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many comments have been made to the Committee regarding the negative image of the Department and its clients within the community and the media portrayal of social security recipients.

<PARA>Then later the report said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any campaign which promotes a `crackdown on welfare fraud' can indirectly malign legitimate users of the social security system.</PARA>
<PARA>I have read those points from the House of Representatives report, known as the O'Keefe report, because they refer to a process that has been under way for many years by this Government called `targeting social security payments' in which there has been a crackdown on welfare fraud. This has been at the base of almost all of the moves that have been made in social security legislation in the past five or six years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In being encouraged to do that by the Opposition, an ethos has been created in the community which has led to the maligning of legitimate users of social security. At the same time, the number of legitimate users of the social security system has ballooned. As Senator Patterson has said, one-third of Australia's population finds itself, by one means or another, a client of the Department of Social Security. In this context, the pressures on departmental officers have increased remarkably. The first page of the Minister's statement states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department has coped well with the pressures of increasing numbers of people using DSS offices.</PARA>
<PARA>I fear that statement, which remains under challenge. I would point out that I do not wish to reflect on individual employees of the Department who are concerned and caring members of staff. I simply wish to say that the pressures are enormous and those pressures include the sense that has been created that the social security recipient is somehow or other a second-class citizen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1989 the House of Representatives report to which I have referred noted that the Department had substantial problems in contact with clients. This contributed to its negative image, not just amongst its clients but in the wider community as well. The picture has not changed a lot. As I said, the pressures have increased. We hear from welfare rights organisations, pensioner groups, community lawyers and social security recipients the constant complaints about long waiting times, unsympathetic attitudes, invasions of privacy, intrusive and rude behaviour by field officers, a lack of consistency or accuracy in the information provided by the Department and a reluctance to advise clients of their rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The O'Keefe report highlighted a number of areas that needed to be addressed. It is a sorry indictment that three years down the track much of that report has been ignored. In addition, I would like to note the work of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs which reported in June 1990 on a reference from the previous year on debt recovery. Many similar comments were made in its report, as was the following major recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Government fund welfare rights units, community legal centres and like bodies to provide competent and independent advice to those relying on the social security system for relief.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a most important recommendation. The statement by the Minister&mdash;in a context very well articulated by Senator Patterson which has, in essence, come out of the blue and which was not intended to be discussed in the Senate today&mdash;appears to me to be an attempt to demonstrate that something significant is being done. It well might be that, indeed, something significant is to be done, if all of the necessary actions surround the establishment of teleservice centres. However, the questions abound; the answers are somewhere in limbo&mdash;they are certainly not in the statement put down by the Minister. As I said, Senator Patterson has covered that wide range of questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that there has been a pilot program but we are not told of the high level of concern in that pilot program&mdash;that trial in Queensland.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our discussions with the Department of Social Security and other relevant people subsequent to the most recent privacy breaches, which have already been referred to in this debate and about which my colleague Senator Bell will have more to say, have indicated to us that pressures on staff&mdash;those same pressures that have been identified formally in the parliamentary context since 1987, and informally even earlier&mdash;have been, in large measure, responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can have all the whiz-bang technology we like but if we do not have sufficient numbers of human beings who are well-trained and supported, those technological systems will break down, systems in which one-third of our population, in this Department alone, are caught up.

That has always been of great concern to the Australian Democrats, a concern which we will continue to express and pursue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, my colleague Senator Bell will have a little more to say on the privacy question.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My contribution to this debate is based upon a question which I asked of the then Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, on 20 August last year. For the benefit of honourable senators, I will repeat my question and Senator Richardson's answer. I asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What measures are being and will be taken by the Department of Social Security to maintain the privacy of clients and the confidentiality of information supplied by clients to that Department? Can the Minister guarantee that action will be taken to ensure that there will not be a recurrence of a recent event in Hobart when a recipient of social security payments received, within a letter addressed to him, other letters addressed to other clients of the Department relating to personal matters?</PARA>
<PARA>The nature of the personal matters that were contained in the letter by mistake was details of levels of sole parent payments, income details, details of marital status, date of birth, address, et cetera. The letter was received by my constituent in such a way that in reading it he cast his eye over the details and said to himself, `These are not correct. These are not the details about myself and my son. They've got it wrong'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having read the details carefully again and again, he checked to whom the letter was addressed. He found that it was addressed to a young lady up the street and that these were her personal details, in which he was not at all interested. The details had been placed in his knowing by the Department. He was concerned. He had not known the status of the young lady up the street and he certainly had not been interested in finding out. This information had been impinged on his knowledge by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When he explained the matter to me, his concern was whether anybody else throughout the country was being told details about other people.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shared that concern and asked the Minister the question to which I have just referred. I remind honourable senators of the answer that was given to me by Senator Richardson:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously the Department has placed great emphasis on privacy and confidentiality over many years, but particularly in more recent years as the use of tax file numbers has increased and the necessity for paying that extra attention has increased. Considering the almost 100 million payments that are made each year, I think that by and large the attention to privacy works and that the privacy and confidentiality provisions of our legislation are observed and maintained. With the extraordinary number of payments to be made, it is always possible that an error can occur. If an error has occurred in Hobart, I shall obviously endeavour to ensure that it is not repeated.</PARA>
<PARA>As far as I am concerned, that endeavour has been insufficient. As Senator Patterson said, if protection of client privacy has the highest priority in the Minister's Department, that priority has not seen any dividend whatsoever. We are overwhelmed with examples of its failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter that concerns me was also raised by Senator Patterson. She mentioned the teleservice, which to me is a further development of the image of a faceless, heartless bureaucracy. I share Senator Patterson's concerns. Also relevant is the development of the electronic lodgment of payments into bank accounts. The retrieval of that money from the third party&mdash;the banks&mdash;obviously places another hurdle in the path of people who might need to seek an explanation of what their payment has been or who might have any one of a number of other problems. The banks have no capacity to deal with these immediate problems. The recipient has to take several extra steps and has to go past another institution before any concerns that he might have can be satisfactorily addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I am concerned, the answer lies in the provision of more staff who are better trained and who have better conditions. It is not sufficient to say that the fault has been a result of a computer error or a systems failure, although that is the excuse we often hear. It is the operators and their level of stress or the amount of work that is required of them. I suggest that reducing the non-service aspects of the staff's work would be a very good place to start. By this I mean the letters designed to pursue the so-called targeting policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question I asked, and the fundamental basis for my contributing to this debate, did not relate to payments made. That was the central part of the Minister's answer; he spoke of 100 million payments. That was not my concern at all, nor was it the concern of my constituent in Hobart. One of the letters designed to check up, one of the letters designed to facilitate, this targeting process was the very nature of the problem. The fact that staff had been engaged in doing this targeting or checking up demonstrates that extra work, rather than service delivery, was being required of this Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the carrying out of that extra work, the failure of this targeting strategy was demonstrated quite clearly. The penalties which the clients of the Department suffer as a result of this strategy are greater than have been properly evaluated by the Department. I suggest that the Department needs to reassess the value of this so-called targeting policy because the ramifications of its failure are greater than just the invasion of privacy of a couple of people. The whole system can be compromised. We saw a demonstration of that in the events in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am relieved to hear that the statements regarding timeliness and quality should be made public. That may address some of the problems. But I am yet to be convinced that the idea of targeting, with the expending of so much extra effort which places the departmental staff under so much extra stress, is worth the potential mistakes that it has obviously brought forward. I look forward to further contributions from my colleague Senator Lees, who doubtless will have a lot to add on the resumption of the debate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that there are others who would wish with me that the report of the National Museum of Australia 1990-91 went a lot further than it does and that it was able to report being much nearer the establishment of the museum and the development of the buildings which would make that possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To recap a little, the Museum of Australia was established by the Museum of Australia Act of 1980 and an interim council appointed. It was dealing at the time principally, I think, with the report prepared in 1975 by Mr Pigott relating to museums and their future in this country. A report was then prepared, the plan for the development of the Museum of Australia, and presented to the Parliament in December 1982. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The site was determined during 1982-83 and presented in the Museum of Australia annual report for that year, the site at Yarramundi having been chosen from some 12 sites which were put to the council at that time by the National Capital Development Commission. The council of the museum looked at all of these possible sites and chose the one that is now known as the museum site at Yarramundi Reach, on the banks of Lake Burley Griffin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time it has been unfortunate that there have not been funds which would have enabled the construction to proceed. For a time money was being made available to the museum to add to its collection, but even that dried up. I wish to refer to those parts of the report that deal with matters they have been able to proceed with. Page 26 deals with the collections catalogued. I am pleased in particular to note the women's cricket collection that has been acquired by the museum. I only wish it could all be on display. Appendix 3 indicates a number of items donated to the museum by individuals, things which will be well kept and which will ultimately be made available. So there is no doubt about the interest of Australians in what this museum will do. </PARA>
<PARA>There are also the Friends of the Museum, who are very active indeed in promoting its development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that Mr Piggot, who prepared the report I referred to earlier, and Dr Ryde, who appeared in the annual report 1989-90, were not reappointed to the council. That was a great pity, because both of them had made a particular contribution. Both of them were very committed to the museum being developed on the site at Yarramundi Reach. </PARA>
<PARA>That is referred to in this report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question of the appropriate location for the Museum was raised by the National Capital Planning Authority which proposed moving the Museum to the Parliamentary Triangle.</PARA>
<PARA>One of these days I hope we get to the bottom of why the site is under consideration when previously it was determined to be on the most suitable site, that is, Yarramundi Reach. The council said that it was seeking funds to proceed with the report in relation to this. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Council is seeking planning funds from the Government in the coming Budget to achieve this objective and is encouraged by the strong support received from Ministers Kelly and Simmons, the Opposition, the Australian people and the Canberra community in particular.</PARA>
<PARA>People generally are not in favour of the site being changed. By all means, we should go ahead with the museum, but I think there is considerable opposition to this plan for changing the site. I have not yet got to the bottom of the reason for it. It is referred to in this report for the first time. I believe it is a retrograde step. I remind those thinking they can put it in the Parliamentary Triangle that before they can do so it will have to be approved by this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of things the museum can be doing. I just wish the council did not have to be diverted by the question of the site when it had previously made up its mind about it. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION (AMENDMENT) BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will amend the child support legislation in a number of respects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will give effect to the Budget announcement that there will be an administrative review process available to all persons named in child support assessments who seek to depart from an assessment raised by the Registrar of Child Support. The grounds for departure will be the same as currently available in a formal process to the court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further amendment was also announced in the Budget context relating to a one time option for a pensioner custodian to opt for the private collection of amounts assessed by the Registrar. This Bill amends the law to allow this option to be exercised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A series of amendments will enhance the powers of the Registrar to  recover amounts that are due. The power of garnishee will enable debts due to be recovered directly from persons holding money on behalf of a payer who has an outstanding child support debt. A facility is also to be included in the child support legislation which is modelled on a similar provision in the Family Law Act 1975 to enable the Registrar to seek an order from a court to set aside an instrument or disposition which has the effect of reducing or defeating a person's capacity to pay child support. These measures have become necessary to ensure that those persons who do not meet their responsibility at law to provide for their children cannot continue to ignore that responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition the Bill contains a number of other amendments to the existing legislation designed to enhance the working of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The child support scheme has brought about a substantial turnaround in the attitude to, and the payment of, child support for children in single parent families since its inception in June 1988. The outcome has been to see disposable incomes of custodial families increased for the benefit of the children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The detail of the amendments to the legislation I will now outline further assists children in single parent families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCESS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will allow a custodian or a liable parent to have an assessment of child support reviewed free of charge and without legal representation by an independent child support review officer who will be employed by the Registrar for that single purpose. The intention is that the parties be able to have an assessment reviewed in the light of their individual circumstances. This review will be a mandatory first step in the general appeal process allowable under the law. It may be exercised at any time during the currency of any assessment which is effective from and after 1 July 1992, but may only be based on the grounds that are presently set out for appeals to the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the grounds that are already prescribed exist, it will be possible for a determination to be made by the Registrar departing from the assessment in force in the same fashion as a court can order a departure from an assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further rights of appeal to the court are retained against determinations that may be made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of major importance in this amendment is the proposal to allow and encourage the parties during the course of this mediation and review process, to agree how the amounts of child support, either in the form of periodic or non periodic amounts, should be paid. It has never been the intention of the assessment process or the scheme itself to limit people agreeing to arrangements for the support of their children. The most satisfactory and unobtrusive way is for the parents to agree to those arrangements themselves with, however, appropriate revenue safeguards in place for custodians who are in receipt of an income tested pension, benefit or allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Financial impact: This amendment has an estimated cost of $0.08m in 1991-92, $0.32m in 1992-93 and $0.45m in 1993-94.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PRIVATE COLLECTION OF MAINTENANCE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present it is a mandatory requirement that pensioners register for collection by the Child Support Agency an amount of child support that arises from an administrative assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will end that mandatory requirement and allow a pensioner to choose to have the payments made direct. Pensioners may still choose to register the assessment for collection from the outset if that is their wish. Providing that they report to the Department of Social Security that payments are being made in full under the assessment they may continue to receive the payments due privately and directly. If they report that payments are  not being made as required, the Department will then require them, as part of the reasonable action for maintenance guidelines, to register the assessment for collection and once registered it must remain registered until the liability ceases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Financial impact: The estimated cost of this measure to the Agency is $0.60m in 1991-92, $1.2m in 1992-93 and outyears offset by estimated savings to Department of Social Security of $0.48m in 1991-92, $2.98m in 1992-93, $2.42m in 1993-94 and $2 6m in 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ENHANCEMENT OF THE RECOVERY POWERS OF THE REGISTRAR.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The methods of collection of amounts due each month to the Registrar are either by deduction at source of income for salary and wage earners or by direct payment to the Registrar from those employees for whom the Agency has not been able to identify an employer or all those liable parents who are not employees for the purposes of the taxation laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The power to recover amounts of child support that have not been paid to the Registrar when due is presently limited to actions in the court and by intercepting refunds of tax due on assessment under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will enhance the power to recover overdue amounts by making provision for the Registrar, by notice in writing, to require a person who is holding money on behalf of the person who has a child support related debt, to pay so much of the money that is held in satisfaction of the debt that is due. The provision will also provide the scope for the Registrar to require amounts that would, in other circumstances, be deemed to be salary and wages, to be garnisheed from time to time to the extent necessary to pay amounts of child support that are due to the Registrar.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are other occasions when the Registrar must act quickly to ensure an opportunity to collect amounts due is not lost. Very often the Registrar becomes aware of amounts being held for the liable parent by a third person, a settlement is due in which the liable parent is to receive a cash amount or of the existence of cash in an account at a financial institution. When all efforts to collect have failed, or in the judgment of the Registrar, it would be appropriate to garnishee funds held it will be possible to do so administratively without seeking an order of the court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Allied to this change is a complementary change to allow the Registrar to garnishee amounts from funds held in  Australia for persons who have a child support debt in Australia who, for the time being, are not in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures should result in an improved rate of receipt of child support for the benefit of children where these opportunities are detected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Financial impact: This amendment is at no cost but an unquantifiable reduction in Social Security outlays could follow.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE OTHER AMENDMENTS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONSENT ORDERS TO BE SUBJECT TO THE SCRUTINY OF THE COURT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An appeal may be lodged with a court concerning the outcome of an assessment, and, after passage of this Bill, against a determination on an administrative assessment made by the Registrar. The present legislation provides that the court must state reasons for making an order which are then required to be entered in the records of the court. This does not apply to orders made by consent and it is therefore possible that pensioners can arrange to depart from an assessment without the new arrangements being subject to the scrutiny of the court. This could undermine the thrust of the legislation in this area. A determination, if any, made by the Registrar will also have to be considered in this way for pensioner custodians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will therefore amend the law to require consent departure orders entered into by pensioners to be subject to the scrutiny of the court as is the case when the court has itself been asked to make an order.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similar amendments are made to other parts of the law to complement this change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Financial impact: There is no cost in this amendment but it ensures Social Security outlays are protected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PAYMENTS MADE OUTSIDE THE AGENCY ARRANGEMENTS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provisions exist to allow the Registrar to take into account payments directly between the parties against the liability to pay the Registrar. This is a popular provision and is much used by clients of the Agency, even though it is the cause of problems from time to time. It is a provision which allows, in special circumstances, the payer to support the children directly as the need arises. The provision is limited in scope and this Bill will open up the range of payments that can be brought to account by the Registrar. In particular payments to third parties from which the custodian and the children receive a benefit will, after the agreement of the parties, and if the Registrar is satisfied, become allowable as credits against the liability to the Registrar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Financial impact: This amendment will have no cost but an unquantifiable reduction in Social Security outlays could follow.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ENFORCEMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT DEBTS WHEN PAYER IS NOT PRESENT IN AUSTRALIA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Child support debts registered with the Agency are debts due to the Commonwealth and this fact has caused difficulty with enforcement in some European countries. They have not been prepared to enforce debts in these circumstances. A minor machinery type change is made to separate the concepts of who is due to be paid child support and who may receive i.e., collect the amounts that are paid in these cases. The change ensures in law the money is due to the payee but it is to paid through the Commonwealth acting as agent for the payee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Financial impact: This amendment will have no cost but an unquantifiable reduction in Social Security outlays could follow.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SETTING ASIDE TRANSACTIONS TO DEFEAT CAPACITY TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A provision exists in the Family Law Act 1975 to enable a court to set aside transactions, whether already made or proposed to be made, the effect of which is to reduce or defeat an order of the court in a maintenance matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill inserts a similar provision in the child support legislation to ensure that the Agency can, in any proceedings under the child support legislation before the court or, by separate application to the court, have the court set aside such transactions, the effect of which has been or will be to reduce or defeat the payer's capacity to pay child support at all or the amount due under any liability that has been established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Financial impact: This amendment is at no cost but an unquantifiable reduction in Social Security outlays could follow.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ELECTIONS TO END A CHILD SUPPORT LIABILITY</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also proposes to remove the ability of pensioners to elect to end the liability of the non custodial parent who is required to pay child support. Because assessment of child support is now mostly an administrative process there is a need to have an administrative method of ending a liability. An example arises where a couple reconciles and it takes no more than an election under the appropriate section in a letter to the Registrar to end the liability. However, pensioners may be unduly influenced by the non custodian to use this election to simply end their legal liability, or of their own volition  pensioners might want to end the liability of the non custodian so as to maximise their pension entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ability to elect to end the liability is to be withdrawn for a pensioner under this section, but, in the event that a liability should be properly ended and the custodian is a pensioner, there are separate provisions called terminating events under which the law operates automatically to end the liability in all of the likely circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Financial impact: This amendment is at no cost but will ensure Social Security outlays are protected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OVERLAPPING PROVISIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will eliminate the need for the Agency to have to offset liabilities that arise, one against the other, when there is both an assessment and an order of the court or an agreement for payment of maintenance in force for the same child for the same period. The offsetting process is now believed to be unnecessary and the new provision to be inserted in its place will have the effect of terminating liabilities under any order or agreement if an assessment has been issued for the same child and for the same period.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial impact: This amendment is at no cost.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS'  AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT  BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for the social security  measures announced in the Prime Minister's February 1992 Economic Statement. One aspect also applies to certain veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is recognised that the current recession has made life more difficult for families with children and for those on a pension or benefit who have to pay rent. With this in mind the Government is keen to target special assistance to these groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first of these initiatives is a one-off payment of a family allowance bonus to all those in Australia who receive a routine family allowance payment on or in respect of 2 April 1992. The bonus will be an amount of $125 for a family with one child; $175 for a family with  two children; $200 for a family with three children; $225 for a family with four children; and $250 for a family with five or more children. A one-off amount of $125 will be made for each child in an approved care organisation who attracts payment of family allowance to the organisation on 2 April 1992. The family allowance bonus is payable only to those whose family allowance is usually paid to an account in Australia or otherwise is paid in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be possible for the Department of Social Security to recover any overpayments of this family allowance bonus but it will not be subject to deductions by the Department to help satisfy any other debt a person may owe to the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This one-off payment will prove useful to those who have dependent children and will also provide an early stimulus to the economy as the money is spent and enters the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second of these initiatives is to increase the child amounts paid to certain pensioners, beneficiaries and recipients of family allowance supplement. The Government has decided to increase these amounts by $3 a child per week except for a child who attracts a frozen rate of payment. Those who will benefit from this initiative will be:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">all recipients of family allowance supplement except to the extent that the rate includes a frozen amount;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">all social security pensioners and beneficiaries with dependent children whose rate of pension or benefit includes a child add-on except to the extent that a child add-on is a frozen rate; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">all veterans' affairs service pensioners with dependent children whose rate of pension includes a child add-on except to the extent that a child add-on is a frozen rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes will take effect on the first payday after 2 April 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a part of the legislation to be introduced shortly to bring about the integration of family allowance, family allowance supplement and pension and benefit child add-on amounts, this $3 increase will become a permanent part of the family payment rates. Speaking in the terms of the current legislation, the intention is to increase from 15% to 16.2% of the combined pensioner couple maximum basic rate the benchmark used in indexing family payments in respect of children aged under 13 and from 20% to 21.2% of the combined pensioner couple maximum basic rate the benchmark for indexation of family payments in respect of children aged 13 to 15 years on 1 January each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is another payment targeted to groups which, because of the cost of bringing up children, the Government has judged to be in particular need at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third initiative involves the abolition of all rent assistance waiting periods for social security recipients except those waiting periods which apply to single beneficiaries without dependent children who are aged below 18. In the 1991 budget it was decided that the existing 26 week waiting periods should be reduced to 18 weeks as of 20 March 1992. This new decision supersedes the 1991 Budget decision for all except those aged single beneficiaries under 18. Some beneficiaries will still serve a de facto waiting period where the standard one week waiting period, or other longer waiting periods, for payment of a social security benefit are involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This package of social security measures continues this Government's proud record of increasing social security and veterans' payments required by those most in need. This package is a compassionate response to the current recession and will help to stimulate economic activity by injecting $317 million into the economy in April. Ongoing extra expenditure will be $65 million for the rest of the current financial year, $290 million in 1992-93, $301 million in 1993-94, $299 million in 1994-95 and $304 million in 1995-96.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the lunch break, I was giving a run-down on the differences between the industrial relations policy of the Government and the industrial relations policy of the Opposition. The Construction Industry Reform and Development Bill 1991 is supposed to be part of the Government's micro-economic reform. Of course, we have tried this before. The Government has tried with the waterfront. I am sure Government members will remember how hard it tried to have micro-economic reform on the waterfront. Senator Collins was given the job of reforming the waterfront. He accepted that with great enthusiasm, and went so far as to promise to resign if he did not succeed. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there has not been a significant amount of improvement on the reform process, I will resign one year from now.</PARA>
<PARA>We all know what happened. Senator Collins is still with us; he is still the Minister. He did not resign. We still have waterside workers on the waterfront working 21 hours a week for a salary of over $47,000 a year. I am sure many people would say, `Good heaven's, I'm in the wrong game'. These workers do not need any particular skill, and they will get a very nice tax cut from Mr Keating's statement of last Wednesday. Indeed, they will get a tax cut of $43.70 a week, but someone on less than half of that&mdash;just under $20,700 a year&mdash;will not get 1c. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I digress further, I point out that, whilst Senator Collins claims that he has done a lot on the waterfront, many of the shocking work practices are still there, and I will give one or two examples. We have idle time, which is when the waterside workers play cards or do whatever else they feel like doing. That idle time has gone up from 11 per cent to 30 per cent, and they are being paid for it. Senator Collins has accomplished a lot in the micro-economic reform area that the Government has put forward as the be-all and end-all of what can be accomplished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of that type of work practice, which is really unbelievable, we have New Zealand importing sugar from Thailand instead of Australia because the cost of transhipping across the Tasman is so appallingly high that New Zealand cannot afford to import it from Australia. A Tasmanian farmer tried to send a container of peas over to Fremantle. The lowest quote he got for sending that container to Fremantle was nearly double the price of sending it to Europe. That is the sort of reform that Senator Collins has been able to achieve. One would think that Senator Collins would have resigned, but no, he has not. As I said, the waterfront was involved in the first attempt to restructure the more radical side of the trade union movement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I have allowed Senator Walters to go on for a little while, wondering what the connection was between what she was saying and the Construction Industry Reform and Development Bill before the Senate. The Bill relates to the building and construction industry. The responsibility for that Bill rests with Senator Cook. Senator Collins does not have anything to do with this. The building industry is not part of his portfolio. Although Senator Walters likes to go on about Senator Collins, that is totally irrelevant to the matter before the Senate. I ask you to ask her to address her remarks to the building and construction industry reform and not to Senator Collins.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think he was just chatting. I said that the Bill that we are debating was part of the Government's micro-economic reform. On a previous occasion, the Government's first try at micro-economic reform was conducted by Senator Collins. So how successful the Government was with its first attempt at micro-economic reform bears very heavily on this Bill. I have just pointed out that the Government was so highly unsuccessful that it really worries me whether I will ever be able to understand anything.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Giles)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Senator Walters, I wonder whether you would allow me to make a ruling. I did note that you had wandered on to the waterfront and off the construction sites, with some threat to continuity. But perhaps you were stretching the relevance to the Bill a little. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before Senator Bolkus called a point of order, I had just said that the Government's first attempt at micro-economic reform was to review the more radical side of the trade union movement and that when that failed it decided to have a go at the construction industry. The Government realised that the New South Wales Government, Mr Greiner's Government, was setting up a royal commission into the productivity of the building industry. The Government guessed, and guessed very rightly, that what would come out of that Royal Commission would not be too darn attractive to the construction industry. So it thought it would pre-empt that Royal Commission by setting up this reform strategy, as it calls it. So the Government decided that this Bill would have to come before the Senate. Was that clever? I do not think it is as clever as it is cynical, but there we have it; that is the way this Government works.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has introduced this Bill as a diversionary tactic to the New South Wales Royal Commission. It realises that that Royal Commission will bring out a tremendous amount of dirty washing. This Bill is to establish a 40 member construction industry development council and a 10 member construction industry reform agency as part of the Government's attempt at reform. This agency will have a limited life and will cease to exist on 30 June 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How much has this building industry reform strategy cost us so far? It was first announced in September 1990 by Senator Cook and it involved a number of departments. A number of committees have been set up which had to have published reports. There were draft</PARA>
<PARA>codes, in-principle agreements, a number of seminars, et cetera. I will read to the Senate a list of the publications that have resulted from the reform strategy and honourable senators will understand where all the money has gone. In September 1990, the first edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Building and Construction Industry:</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Background Discussion Papers</EMPHASIS> was published by the Department of Industrial Relations; in November 1990, it put out a second edition. In 1990, the Department published <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Building and Construction Industry Reform Strategy: Statements by the Minister for Industrial Relations</EMPHASIS>. In December 1990, the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, the Department of Administrative Services, and the Department of Employment, Education and Training also put out reports. In December 1990, the Department of Industrial Relations published <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Proceedings from Ministerial Presentation and Industry Responses</EMPHASIS>. In April 1991, the Department published the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Industrial Relations Working Party: Report to the Minister for Industrial Relations</EMPHASIS>; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Industry Development Working Group</EMPHASIS>; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Skills Formation Working Group</EMPHASIS>; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Contracts Working Party</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report</EMPHASIS>; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rise and Fall and Cost Reimbursement Clauses</EMPHASIS>; and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of the Workers' Benefit Scheme in the Building and</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Construction Industry</EMPHASIS>. I wonder how many trees had to be cut down in my State to publish all those reports. Where has it got us? It has got us absolutely nowhere. We are aware that this process has already cost several million dollars and that an additional $10.8m will be spent over the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad point about the Bill is that, like the Waterside Workers Federation which ran the waterfront reform, the Building Workers Industrial Union is running this reform. It has no desire to deal with the main problems facing the industry. It is only intent on maintaining its own standards, its own workers compensation, superannuation, redundancy payments and compulsory unionism. It is interested only in  turning all those Sydney and Melbourne standards into national standards. Unfortunately, the danger is that the agency could close the industry to all those firms that refuse to comply with its behavioural criteria. It also threatens to lock out small specialist contractors, particularly the skilled tradesmen and professionals. As a result of this, several small organisations have refused to sign the in-principle agreement and to join in the council. At least one of the industry organisations is only participating under duress. This, of course, is said privately; they would not be game to say it publicly in that particular industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This industry is very sceptical about the possibility of sorting out those dreadful industrial relations problems that have grown over so many years. The Government should have waited for the result of the New South Wales Royal Commission before it brought legislation into this Parliament, because there is already considerable concern regarding a $1.5m transfer from the construction employees redundancy trust to the building construction industry reform agency, an agency set up by this Bill. I would like to see what the Royal Commission has to say about the legality of that before the legislation comes in. The whole thing might just collapse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, the Opposition is not interested in going along with this farce of a reform because it is obvious that the Government, once again, is creating a diversionary tactic. If the Government were serious about wanting real reform, then we would support it. If it allowed voluntary unionism, then we would support it. But it cannot be talking seriously about workplace bargaining or enterprise bargaining&mdash;whichever words it likes to use&mdash;while it continues to insist on compulsory unionism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there is compulsory unionism, this industry will never be able to allow the firms to deal directly with their employees. This is the very basis of democracy. When the Government comes to the realisation that what people want is not a Labor-style democracy but a true democracy&mdash;that is what the people want, and they should be given the choice&mdash;we will go along with its legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to support my colleagues on this Construction Industry Reform and Development Bill, I make the point that it seeks to establish two distinct bodies: firstly, a Construction Industry Development Council and, secondly, a Construction Industry Reform Agency. While it involves a number of the larger employer and employee organisations or unions&mdash;the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors and the BWIU, amongst others&mdash;it is notable that a number of the smaller organisations in the building industry declined the invitation to become involved because they anticipated what was going to happen in terms of this legislation. Of course, it is about cementing relations between big unions, big government and big business. It will do little in the future to improve the productivity and output of the building industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some aspects of the Bill that I would particularly like to comment on. It is interesting to see when looking at the Bill that clause 17(1)(b) states that the function of the agency is `to assist in the implementation of industry agreements', while under (c) it goes on to state that its function is `to develop, and assist in the implementation of, industry codes and practices'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question I have relates to industry agreements and the function of the agency. I am glad the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) is in the chamber. As my colleagues, particularly Senator Walters, have pointed out the strategy has been operating for some time. There has been expenditure of $3m, and it is anticipated another $10m or so will be spent over the next few years. Are we really talking about industry agreements? The charter under which it has been operating comes from the Department of Industrial Relations and refers to the creation of a single award for the industry as recommended by the AIRC full bench inquiry into the building and construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Will the new agency be guided by the national wage case decision of October 1991, when the enterprise bargaining principle was established, will it be working under the industry statement that the Minister delivered last October or will it be operating under the guidelines, as one can interpret them, contained in the One Nation package?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seems to be a moving feast with the industrial relations system of this country. There are a number of aspects relating to the national wage case decision. The part of the decision which interests me is that which refers to the agreement not involving a reduction in ordinary earnings or a departure from the Arbitration Commission standards of holiday pay, annual leave with pay or long service leave with pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the recent announcement by the Minister to the effect that the public interest clause of the current legislation will be modified, I ask whether that part of the decision will still stand. When one looks at establishing an industry standard, one must question the current position of the Government and how it fits in with the reference in the One Nation statement to workplace agreements. It is rather difficult to understand how we can have an industry agreement, yet at the same time have workplace agreements. It would seem to me, as far as building site operations are concerned, that it would be far more appropriate to look at workplace agreements. There are certainly very distinct contradictions in the various positions that have been put before us: the Full Bench decision; the Minister's statement of October last year; and the position which is spelt out in the One Nation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that when I questioned the Minister on this on Monday of this week we received a very confused answer which did not spell out clearly the intention of the Government. Perhaps tonight the Minister can spell it out more clearly than he did then because, in essence, all he said then was, `we will be amending this; we will be amending that' without actually specifying what he was going to amend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this indicates, when we look at the three positions, is that the industrial relations policy of this Government is in total disarray. It is not sure what it is operating under. The Arbitration Commission must be totally confused with the moving feast we have before us. I would suggest that the time has come to clarify the matter. One can interpret in the One Nation statement an enormous move towards the Opposition's industrial relations policy, and I would like to spell that out quite clearly here. It is not what the Minister said today in Question Time. The Minister has continued to misrepresent the Opposition's industrial relations policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has said on numerous occasions&mdash;Dr Hewson, Mr Howard and others&mdash;that its position on industrial relations is, first of all, to bring an end to compulsory unionism; secondly, people will have the option of staying in the current system or setting up their own voluntary employment agreements. Nothing can be clearer than that. For the Minister to continually make the sort of comments that he has made is a total misrepresentation of the facts. What does the establishment of the agency really mean? Is it working under a single industry proposition or, as is suggested in the legislation, under industry agreements? How will those agreements operate? Will they in fact be workplace agreements, as stated in the One Nation statement, or will they relate to the statement that the Minister made last October?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to comment on a couple of other aspects of the debate. I am glad that Senator Bell is in here with us, because he likened the Construction Industry Development Council that is being established to the Cattle Council and I think he said the Wool Council. Certainly it was one of the National Farmers Federation's affiliated bodies. There are vast differences between the Cattle Council, the Wool Council or any of those National Farmers Federation's affiliated bodies, and this proposed Construction Industry Development Council. To begin with, they are voluntary organisations. They are not funded by the Government. They are funded within themselves by contributions from the members, who, of course, are the cattle producers, wool producers or whatever. Also, these bodies are not involved in a tripartite exercise of enshrining the things that I mentioned before&mdash;the position of big business, big unions and big government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the fundamental problems we have with the proposal before us is that it will enshrine the closed shop mentality that we have in the construction industry today. We have seen it in all capital cities around Australia. We have seen it in Perth. One can walk through Perth at any time and see signs up on building sites saying, `No ticket, no start' or, `No ticket, no job'. This Development Council will not go to the heart of overcoming that problem. In fact, I would go so far as to say that it is a fundamental waste of taxpayers' money. It would be far better if we moved down the path of getting rid of compulsory unionism by allowing the employers and employees in the various aspects of the industry to work out their own workplace agreements or voluntary enterprise agreements and get on with the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect is that it will severely inhibit subcontractors in the operations that they carry out. I believe we will find the heavy hand coming down on top of them, forcing them into a situation whereby they have to become part of the union movement or comply with the rules that are established within it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To return to my initial comments on the Bill, it is interesting to note, as other speakers have, that the Government did not wait for the report of the Gyles Royal Commission, and it is most unlikely that that Royal Commission would recommend this course. In fact, the Government has pre-empted the recommendations that will come from that Commission, and it will be interesting to see, when those recommendations are brought down, whether or not the Government is prepared to change course in terms of the legislation we have before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The guidelines that are set out here in respect of industry agreements will do nothing to improve workplace agreements; they will do nothing to improve harmony on building sites. Until such time as there is freedom of choice as to whether or not individuals belong to a union, and whether or not the various companies operating within the industry have to comply with the bully tactics which have been a feature of the building industry in this country for many years, we will not get proper reform in the building industry and we will not get increases in productivity and efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, this particular Bill and the motions that we are going through will continue to cost the Australian public significant amounts of money. It will continue to enshrine the worst features of our current industrial relations system. It will not allow the opportunity for true enterprise bargaining to be developed, or true voluntary employment agreements. In fact, with the current position as I have outlined it&mdash;with the October decision of the Full Bench of the Arbitration Commission, the statement by the Minister in October and also what was said, although it is not clear, in the One Nation statement&mdash;there will continue to be much confusion in this country for a considerable period, until such time as the Government makes up its mind what its industrial relations policy actually is.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. I am sure that the pearls of wisdom that I have to impart to the Senate will be worth all of this commotion. The reform process that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) is embarking upon and announced last year is, of course, an outrageous joke to just about everyone involved in the construction industry in Australia. It is a case of closing the gate after the horse has bolted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have just seen, during the late 1980s and early 1990s, the construction of thousands upon thousands of square metres of office space in capital cities around Australia. Indeed, in my home State of Western Australia, where Senator Knowles, Senator Crane and I have the pleasure of living, we have some 250,000 square metres of brand new office space available for lease at the moment, construction having just been finished&mdash;an area of some 60 acres of office space which has been completed in Perth but cannot be leased because of the effects of the recession that Senator Cook's Government wrought on Australia's business community and the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane we have a very similar situation. We have thousands upon thousands of square metres of office space all constructed within a construction industry and under an industrial relations system characterised by rorts, restrictive work practices and the domination of the sites by trade union boss thugs&mdash;one could not use any other word to describe them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the reform that should have taken place should have been done at the beginning of the last decade, not at the beginning of a decade when construction in the capital cities of Australia will be negligible because there is no-one to fill the space because of the recession that this Government inflicted upon the business community of Australia. So here we are embarking upon on a reform process, as I said, at the beginning of a decade when there will not be much construction. There will be virtually no construction in the capital cities of Australia for at least the first half of this decade, and probably not until a few years after John Hewson has been made Prime Minister and gets this country back on the road again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perth has a vacancy factor of 30 per cent and other major capital cities have vacancy factors of between 15 and 25 per cent. So we have had the building boom. This Minister purports to be concerned about reforming the construction industry&mdash;an industry that in his former incantation or incarnation he had a lot to do with ensuring was very unstable, particularly in his home State of Western Australia. It is a joke and a farce and it is almost hypocritical for this Minister to be involved in this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to look back at the effects of what happened during the late 1980s and early 1990s on the very need for a reform process. During that era we had for the financing of construction enormously high interest rates of 20 per cent or more. We also had large multimillion dollar construction contracts; some of the projects were in excess of a quarter of a billion dollars. The large construction firms were almost forced into a corner to give away enormous amounts of concessions to the building workers and the unions to ensure that the buildings were finished on time. Of course, virtually no building in Australia was finished on time because the building firms were all strung out by the thug bosses of the union movement who control the construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now see right around Australia the major construction firms having to compete for what little business there is left. They are now competing with the smaller construction firms, all of a sudden realising that the sort of concessions they gave away to the building unions during the late 1980s just are not the real world and cannot be lived with. All of a sudden these concessions are coming home to roost. Perhaps that is a very good thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic imperatives caused by the decline in the rate of construction around Australia will probably do more to reform the industry and work practices than any quango set up by this Minister under the guise of trying to reform an industry that should have been reformed 10 years ago. I guess it is fair to say that it is a reflection on the lack of progress made on that industrial relations reform by the Fraser Government that has left Australia in the mess it was in during the 1980s. The Liberal Party should perhaps take some of the blame for not doing what it should have done in reforming industrial relations back in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this Minister and this Government after some nine years in power really should not be taken seriously when they talk about reforming the construction industry. In fact, most of the reforms they talk about, be they micro reforms or tax reforms or anything else, should be taken as a joke by the Australian community. The Government has been around for nine years and all of a sudden it has realised that it has been doing things wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the atmosphere on a construction site, which is a reflection and a monument to the sorts of industrial relations practices that occur in the construction industry. In my last 10 years in private practice, I had the job of going on to construction sites virtually everyday. I can tell those who have not been on a construction site that virtually anywhere in Australia when one walks off the footpath and crosses the barricade on a construction site it is like what it would have been like walking into eastern Europe. The atmosphere on the site is one of intimidation. The union shop stewards, the people who control the site, basically make anyone who is not a member of the union feel like an interloper. Quite frankly, when one leaves a construction site anywhere in a capital city in Australia, it is like a breath of fresh air because one is back again in a free world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Entering construction sites around Australia is basically like stepping into a communist nation where people's individual rights, and certainly the rights of people who are not members of unions, are repressed. One only has to ask the surveyors, those who enter construction sites as couriers or anyone who is not a member of the union what it is like to walk into a construction site to learn that it is like crossing the border into an eastern European country or Cuba. People's rights are infringed, they feel intimidated, and it is virtually the same wherever they go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long term effects of this on Australia in the 1990s should be remembered; they are not obvious. Australia had a construction boom. We had a chance to develop some management practices and factor competitive advantages in our region of the world. Because we were doing so much construction we had a tremendous opportunity to develop an advantage in our international competitiveness in the area of construction. However, as a result of the industrial relations provisions and the way that the unions behaved in concert, almost in conspiracy, with the major construction firms in Australia, we ended up with a situation where Australia's construction industry by and large is now not competitive in the south-east Asian and Asia-Pacific region. It is an industry that I suggest to the Parliament and the Senate could have had great export potential for Australia in the 1990s&mdash;an era when we need export opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Korea is a great example of a nation that has developed a competitive edge in the area of construction management and project management. It is exporting those talents to the rest of the south-east Asian region. We have lost an enormous amount of our potential advantage in being able to export the expertise that we have developed in that area. Basically, the project managers and the construction firms did not have the flexibility that they needed to learn to manage properly. Most of the flexibility was taken out of their hands by the union movement and the union thugs who control that movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The export of materials could also have flowed from developing that competitive advantage. We could have used Australian construction materials such as the granite that is being mined up in the north-west of Western Australia and on the Nullarbor. The mined granite and other building materials could have been exported to those whom we exported our management expertise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a very professional, competitive and dynamic interior design business. Interior designers go into the empty shells of buildings and fit them out with partitions, furnishings and so forth. It is another downstream, value added industry that could have followed in the footsteps of our construction management and project management expertise, had we had been able to export it to the south-east Asian region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say that that is not happening at the moment. There are certainly some architects, interior designers and construction project managers who are able to get into the rapidly developing Asia-Pacific region. They are forced to do so due to the total lack of work in Australia which stems from the recession caused by Senator Cook and his Government. They are making progress overseas, but the architects and builders that I have been speaking to in the last few weeks say that their impact has been very small. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to some of the work practices on building sites that are still happening today as I speak and which need reforming. They have not been faced up to and will not be faced up to until we get rid of the no ticket no start principle, union monopoly of power on construction sites and centralised control over the work practices and terms and conditions of employment on building sites around Australia. As all my colleagues have mentioned&mdash;Senator Durack said it in his address and Senator Crane and Senator Walters reinforced it&mdash;until the monopoly of control over labour on construction sites is removed, no other problems will be solved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for the community to realise what happens on building sites. As I said, it is like crossing no-man's-land to get into the building sites in Australia because of the hoardings around them. Most members of the Australian community are sick and tired of hearing about the sorts of work practices we have on our construction sites, they just do not care any more or they do not find out about them because they all take place behind those hoardings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some practices would appal people. Some awards say that construction must stop if it starts raining. That is probably quite sensible if men are 30 storeys up on the Central Park site or the QV1 site and they are trying to move steel or something else around a floor slab. It can get slippery and dangerous in the rain, and there is a safety issue for sure. That is probably a sensible place to start, but on construction sites around Australia it does not take a shower or a rainstorm to get people to stop working; it takes a few drops of rain falling on the newspaper of someone sitting down having a cup of tea for the call, `Right, all out; let's stop'. Then there is a four hour waiting period in which it is decided whether that rain was a passing shower or perhaps even a seagull flying over the guy's newspaper and those on site go back to work. That may also be sensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But to take it a step further, if the people sitting in their air-conditioned sheds waiting to decide whether it is going to be a rainy day are rained on, if they have to go to another part of the site during a four-hour waiting period, then the whole site closes down for the entire day. That has happened on Perth construction sites for the past few years, and I presume it has happened in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and every other construction site around the place. Although the people who are sitting in the amenity shed waiting to see whether or not a shower passes may be approached by a project manager or an officer of the construction firm who says, `Look, we'll give you an umbrella so that you can get from your amenities shed to wherever you are going and keep yourselves dry', they still close the whole site down for the entire day. One can imagine the enormous amount of money that is tied up in a quarter of a billion dollar building site by these delays&mdash;the capital equipment, the crane hire and the concrete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example concerns employees who are asked to continue work by transferring to air-conditioned areas on a building site to continue work. All employees go home if they have to pass through an area that is not air-conditioned. On many building sites it is impossible to air-condition the lifts. An employee working in an air-conditioned area on, say, floor 21 of a construction site may be asked to go up to floor 30 to do some more work&mdash;and that would be quite reasonable as it is another air-conditioned area. It might be a hot day but the employee works in an air-conditioned environment like everyone else in the world. If he is required to jump in an unconditioned lift for 2 1/2 minutes to go up to the thirtieth floor to continue his work, it is a case of all out, the site closes down and, of course, money is lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, another outrageous situation concerns a situation in which a courier delivering, say, another set of rivets to a site is not allowed to take the rivets off his truck unless he is a member of the BLF or the Building Workers Industrial Union, or whatever the case may be. It is quite outrageous and quite an infringement of the courier's individual rights and freedoms. He cannot unload his own truck if he is not a member of this union. It is a case of no ticket, no start, not only for the construction workers but for other people who come on to the site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of other things that I would like to mention. There are excessive demands when it comes to things like protective clothing. A recent case in Perth involved employees who needed to wear sunglasses when working outside in the bright sunlight. This was a quite reasonable demand. Most people in industry who need sunglasses&mdash;for example, airline pilots&mdash;go out and buy them themselves. But not in the building industry. The unions say that the construction firm has to supply them&mdash;not just any sunglasses, but the award insists that they have to be Bolles. So one goes down to a boutique and buys Bolle sun glasses for all one's construction workers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is pretty good stuff. It is pretty hard to get one of those jobs now because there are not many buildings being built any more. Of course, they are demanding moon suits and so forth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the unions are taking what are called technical issues to absolute extremes. Technical issues are used to disrupt sites when awards, pay increases or some other matters are being negotiated. Some of the issues which have been used to close down entire sites in the last couple of years include examples like the fact that the coat hooks were too close together in the amenities shed; a lunch table was 10 millimetres too short&mdash;this excuse was used to close down an entire multi-million dollar construction site in Perth in recent years; insufficient chairs in a lunch room, resulting in a day's strike; a lunch room being demanded for a small team of shop fitters in an established shopping centre; double-time payments for shift work; the rostering of employees taking sickies&mdash;instead of just taking sickies when one is sick, the building union actually sets up a roster of when people will take sickies; and shutting down cranes and so forth due to windy conditions which were not windy at all&mdash;just that somebody felt a bit of wind go past, probably a bit of wind from a shop steward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One of the worst aspects of this problem is the total inflexibility in the work force. Account is not taken of the local conditions, the economic climate and what is going on in the community where projects are being built. Rostered days off&mdash;of course, one day off every four weeks is another rort&mdash;cannot be flexibly handled. An employer cannot align a rostered day off with a weekend; he cannot arrange the week's work. If a concrete pour or some sort of major work is being done on the Monday, he cannot go to the union and say, `Let's have the rostered day off after we've finished this concrete pour' or `after we've finished this slab' or `after we've put the glazing on'. There is absolutely no flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what has to take place. There needs to be flexibility. The managers need to be able to manage. The workers have to be able to become part of a team. It cannot be `us and them'. It cannot be the building owner or the project manager versus the people who are building the building. It all has to a team effort. The construction industry works as a team. We need to have sensible arrangements site by site, building by building, project by project. Flexibility needs to be is built into the terms and conditions of the workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the process that Senator Cook is embarking upon and seeking the Senate's approval through legislation for, is, as I said 15 to 20 minutes ago, a joke and outrageous because it will not change any of this. It will not allow the managers to manage. It will not allow Australia's construction industry to become world competitive. It will not allow us to build buildings to best international practice standards. It will ensure that it will cost Australian industry more to build our buildings than it costs any other nation. It will ensure that, until you get rid of the `no ticket no start' rule and union control of construction sites, the reform that just about everyone in Australia except for the union movement wants just will not take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I conclude by repeating: this legislation is a joke, it is outrageous and it really should be condemned as a farce. We have just spent nine years with an industrial relations system that probably should have been, as I said, reformed under the Fraser Government and it was not. If this Minister is interested in reforming the industry, he should have started nine years ago; and if he is interested in reforming it now, he should look at the real problems&mdash;and they are union domination and control; inflexibility; and uncompetitive work practices. He should start there. He should not start by setting up another quango. Australians have had enough quangos, they have had enough government waste, they have had enough of high taxes and they have had enough of this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I reiterate what has just been said by Senator Campbell&mdash;that the Construction Industry Reform and Development Bill really is a charade, a sham and a facade for substantial legislation. It does absolutely nothing about the fundamental problems that the building industry has. It does nothing about competition, proper micro-economic reform or voluntary unionism. It does nothing about breaking the nexus between being compelled to be a member of a union and being allowed to work in this country. It is like collective bargaining, productivity based agreements and micro-economic reforms which are being dragged inexorably from this Government in a very incremental sluggish way which guarantees that we will have a continuing lack of efficiency in the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the building industry, being a largely non-traded sector, is not subject to the efficiency disciplines which result from other competition. It is not subject, naturally, to import competition. The additional costs cast upon the industry due to the various inefficiencies that prevail are passed on to owners and, of course, inevitably, guarantee that there will be a misallocation of resources and this impacts upon the competitiveness of other industries. Some people have estimated that the cost of over-regulation and inefficient regulatory systems within the building industry cost Australians about $1 billion a year. Restrictive work practices will always flourish wherever an industry or government service is protected against competition or where unions have the muscle to keep other workers off their patch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that Senator Cook's legislation is a creature of intention to be put in place prior to the findings of the Royal Commission into Productivity in the Building Industry in New South Wales. It is, by any measure, a shallow attempt in the name of economic reform to reduce inefficiency. It is an example of attempts which have given micro-economic reform a bad name. Nothing has been done about either the inflexible industrial relations or the lack of competition in the industry between employees, workers and contractors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to a report on big city office construction jobs made last year by the Industry Commission, evidence was provided, albeit in confidence, that annual wages for crane drivers were between $130,000 and $160,000 a year, with dogmen earning $100,000. That is not because of a commercial judgment that a crane driver is worth $160,000. It is not the result of some economic based decision that the value of his contribution manifests itself in $160,000 a year. It is simply the amount of wages that he is able to extract from his employer under the threat of industrial disputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the fundamental industrial relations problems is the entrenched system of full pay during walk-offs. I think it was Senator Campbell who made some comment about how judgments are made in respect of whether employees continue to work during rain periods. The standard test is that one puts a cigarette paper outside the shed and, if one gets three drops of rain on it, that by definition means it is a wet day and all the workers are off the site.</PARA>

One of the great scandals of the last three decades is that 40 per cent of lost man-time was due to alleged safety issues. It is not without significance that when the Queensland Electricity Commission banned or stopped full pay on stoppages over safety issues, the number of bomb hoaxes suddenly stopped overnight. We have seen the same problem all around Australia. Senator Cook saw the same problem with the casino in Western Australia, where almost daily there were bomb hoaxes. </PARA>

It would be more shameful if one could establish that the employees themselves were making phone calls that a bomb was about to explode somewhere on a construction site and then walking off the site for a day or two while the police went through a monotonous, tortuous and difficult search to ascertain whether or not there was a bomb.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my knowledge&mdash;and Senator Cook might correct me&mdash;there is no other country that pays full wages for walking off in the case of bad weather. In Germany and Sweden workers receive about 65 per cent of their standard pay. In other countries it is between 50 and 75 per cent. In the US it is zero because I think workers in that country have an in-built loading in their pay rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could go on ad nauseam citing all the examples of the litany of abuses that take place&mdash;abuses which are inevitable in an incestuous environment where, to be allowed to work, one has to become a member of the union. The unions have divine control over the employers who pass on the costs to the owners. Therefore, we have a dislocation of resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will do absolutely nothing about that; I suspect that it is not intended to do so. Probably it has about the same status as this Government's micro-economic reform&mdash;the same status as its productivity clauses in industrial relations agreements. It is very much like the One Nation statement&mdash;a token attempt to pretend that something constructive is being done. But until this Government is prepared to accept that there are inherent and fundamental problems in the building industry that require total change, there will be no significant improvements in efficiency, costs or competition. I say with the greatest respect to Senator Cook that this legislation is nothing more than a cynical attempt to purport to be making a change which the Minister and this Government know is not taking place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;The Senate is now concluding the debate on the Construction Industry Reform and Development Bill 1991. It has been an extraordinary debate. Many Opposition speakers I have heard have said that they oppose this Bill, and I understand that the Opposition will vote against it. Opposition members have proceeded to lay down a series of incidents or examples to demonstrate why, in their view, there is considerable need for improvement and reform in the building industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without accepting all those examples, because many are emotional and highly coloured, I would make the point that nonetheless they support the basic contention of this Government. The building and construction industry in Australia is one of the most significant industries in this country. It is an industry that we have sought to reform over the period of our Government. In fact, we were the only government in Australia that moved in the end to deregister by legislative action the Builders Labourers Federation because of its role in creating industrial disharmony and resorting to illegal tactics in the industry. We did that, and indeed we did it twice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recognition of those changes there is a need to go further and build on them to make it a more competitive industry. Yet we have had this extraordinary display from Opposition members in which they say they oppose the Bill but, nonetheless, trot out all the reasons why reform in this industry is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not an industrial relations exercise. It is an industry exercise. The Bill is about reforming the industry. That means, therefore, that it looks at industry development and research and development&mdash;the industry spends less on research and development than any other industry in Australia; it looks at training; it looks at how we should sort out regulations which in some senses prevent the efficient operation of the industry; and, of course, because it is complete, it deals with industrial relations too. But it would be wrong to assume that one can solve problems in the industry by simply concentrating on industrial relations matters and that there are some simple, glib industrial relations explanations. There are not. Industrial relations problems reflect the problems of the whole industry and this requires a holistic approach to deal with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are proposing to set up a reform agency which will look at improving productivity in the industry quite significantly, because that needs to be done. We seek to ensure that contracts are delivered on time and on cost. We will promote the building and construction sector in Australia as an export industry. We will engage in innovation by nominating, with the agreement of the parties, demonstration sites or special sites in which new methods of work can be trialled. New ways of doing things can be experimented with so that we can learn how to do things better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill depends on there being a degree of cooperation in trying to achieve the purpose of reform. What we have heard from the Opposition is that one ought to make war on unions. I would not want to contend that there needs to be no reform on that front, as there does need to be reform. However, I do not think there needs to be the sort of, for want of a better word, reform that the Opposition preaches. Certainly I do not think one can reform the industry by trying to eliminate the trade union movement from it, as the Opposition seems to be arguing here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key element of our reform process is that we succeeded in doing something significant before this Bill saw the light of day. We had extensive consultations, ranging over most of last year, with all the industry organisations and with the consumers of the industry. I refer to the Building Owners and Managers Association and the major investors in the industry. We went through that process exhaustively. We achieved an in-principle agreement which they have all signed. They have all committed themselves to the goals of the in-principle agreement&mdash;stretch targets, hard goals&mdash;set down in black and white. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the Opposition's contentions in this debate is that there has been insufficient commitment to this concept from the industry. I do not know what Opposition members have been reading or how they interpret insufficient commitment, but not only is the Commonwealth Government committed to it, but also the signatures of the governments of Victoria, South Australia, the ACT and Western Australia appear on the in-principle agreement. The signature of the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors, the organisation representing the major construction companies in this country, appears on the agreement, as do the signatures of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Metal Trade Industry Association, a number of trade unions involved in the industry, the Building Owners and Managers Association, the Building Industry Specialist Contractors Organisation of Australia, the Australian Earthmovers and Road Contractors Federation of Australia and the Master Plumbers and Mechanical Services Association of Victoria. We have a commitment by organisations representing the stakeholders in this industry to arrive at the reform targets that we have set down. This is an example of cooperative reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said in this debate that we should have waited until the New South Wales Royal Commission reported. We proposed this initiative&mdash;and if there be any question on this point one should refer to the Ministers of Labour Advisory Council agenda in April 1990&mdash;to the New South Wales Government before it announced its own Royal Commission. We were first in the ring before the New South Wales Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad history of the industry has been that over the past 15 or so years there have been 22 separate inquiries into the industry; the Royal Commission is yet another. The trouble with inquiries is that they entertain and inform while they are in currency, but their reports have gathered dust on the shelves of libraries after the inquiries have been completed. The big gap relates to the implementation of recommendations and achievement of reform. We did not want to be in what grew in New South Wales to be partly a political exercise, partly an exercise of scapegoatism and partly an exercise directed at real problems in the industry; and we did not want to be in yet another inquiry. There was no appetite for another inquiry, but an appetite for change, improvement and reform. That is why the organisations have come forward so quickly to commit themselves to the proposal that we have put forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Wednesday night the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), at about this time, rose in the House of Representatives and put down the One Nation statement. By putting through this legislation, we will position the country to ensure that the massive commitment in that statement to infrastructure development goes ahead in the most efficient way. The Government will commit itself to ensuring that the greenfields agreements necessary for that reform to occur can be in place when the infrastructure developments start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are in a flat period of building activity; that is true, and it has been referred to by a number of speakers. This is the time when the structural changes in the industry ought to be made so that the efficiencies can be achieved now, when there is a recognition that work is scarce, and so that the reform proposals, having been achieved, can be presented to would-be investors and this industry can come out of its slump sooner in a new guise and be reborn. That is why it is absolutely essential to move now and not hang back and wait for a royal commission's report, which may or may not make useful suggestions about reform, which may or may not be able to be implemented straight away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government makes this undertaking: if anything comes out of the New South Wales royal commission report that is worthwhile and should be adopted, we will pick that up as we go. We will not delay this process. Australia cannot wait any longer; we want to get on with it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During Question Time I asked Senator Collins whether the Government would consider a request by the Australian Professional Cycling Council for funding in respect of litigation in which it is involved with one Martin Vinnicombe. The Minister advised that the request would be judged on its merits but that thus far no request had been made and that therefore the question was academic. I suspect that Senator Collins had no reason to know this, but my understanding, subsequent to that question and answer, is that a request has been made by that Council and that the litigation starts tomorrow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make no comment about the substance of the litigation except to say that in the event that Mr Martin Vinnicombe is successful, it means that the price he has paid for cheating on other athletes will be three months suspension. He would be back in the saddle after that and he would escape the penalty which is imposed by the Australian Sports Commission, the Australian Olympic Committee and the Australian Amateur Cycling Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not purport to be making judgments about the moral conduct of Mr Vinnicombe, but by sheer accident I observed last night on one of the television programs Mr Vinnicombe complaining that perhaps he had just made one small mistake. He wanted to know what price he had to pay for that one small mistake. He was extolling what he had done for Australia. This seemed to be&mdash;in my words, not his&mdash;a pretty shabby reward for his endeavours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stand here on behalf of those athletes who were denied their proper rewards for competing on their merits, for those athletes who chose not to cheat. I think now of some obscure cyclist who, but for the cheating of Mr Martin Vinnicombe, may well have been a silver medallist in Edinburgh. I think of the obscure cyclist, whose name I do not have, who may well have been denied a bronze medal at the Olympic Games in Seoul save for the fact that Mr Martin Vinnicombe defeated him. The life endeavours of an athlete and the ultimate reward are snatched from him by a man now shown&mdash;not necessarily on that occasion&mdash;to have been prepared to cheat, not only on his own country and on his own supporters but also on the athletes who opposed him in fair and what they thought was open and proper competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps one of the redeeming features of Mr Vinnicombe is that he at least admitted straight up that he was a cheat. But he did not admit that some little time ago. He was asked in an interview in mid-April about the controversy and he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Oh, I've had trouble with all different riders all the way through, accusing me of drug taking. If it's not steroids, it's something else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If steroids hadn't been heard of, there would be something else.</PARA>
<PARA>Here is a man who says that this controversy that has dogged him for some time is because of jealous competitors who do not have, in his mind, the same ability as he does. Referring to a matter which has previously been touched upon in this chamber by my colleague Senator Baume, involving a controversy in 1987 regarding a complaint that had been laid against him, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was in 87 I think. A cyclist in our team reported me for supposedly offering steroids for sale. People quite often look for excuses for their own lack of ability or lack of dedication or whatever. So there had to be an excuse why I'm better than them. If they can blame a small tablet they will. That's the stupid thing about it because all the equipment and all the drugs are available to everyone.</PARA>
<PARA>I have read the evidence in that matter and, while I do not make a definitive judgment, on the balance of probability I came to the conclusion that Martin Vinnicombe had sought to sell drugs to Gary Neiwand. Now Mr Vinnicombe tells us that he has been harshly dealt with, yet in April of 1981 he was saying that those who had made the accusations against him were only jealous of him. On the Jana Wendt program, for which he was paid $8,000 for these little pearls, he was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So you are telling me you have never taken steroids before?</PARA>
<PARA>Vinnicombe replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, that's correct.</PARA>
<PARA>He got $8,000 for telling that lie. But perhaps Mr Vinnicombe did not know at that stage that there was a prescription available which was made out on 27 May 1987 by a Dr Daisy Balm for a substance called primabolin. Anybody who knows anything about anabolic steroids knows that primabolin is an anabolic steroid which is used by athletes to enhance their performance and to cheat on their fellow competitors. Mr Vinnicombe now claims that it is unjust that he should be disqualified for two years for cheating in this way. It seems to say something for Mr Vinnicombe that, as I look back at his history, when he was being asked about whether he had any remorse about what he had done to other athletes and what he had done to Australia he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why should I be punished for one stupid f. . . mistake? But hell, had I not been caught and gone on to become world or Olympic champion, people would have been none the wiser.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, had he not been caught he would have been, in his mind, the world champion and the world would have been his oyster. Now he is in litigation. But he was only saying some little time ago&mdash;earlier this year, if I recall correctly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm banned from amateur cycling, not professional cycling, so they can get f. . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That was the level of remorse Mr Vinnicombe had for the pain and suffering he has brought on not only his own family but also his coach, his supporters, his competitors, his fellow athletes&mdash;those he cheated upon&mdash;not to mention the taxpayers' funds of which he had been a significant recipient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should be particularly concerned if I thought that the Australian Professional Cycling Council was unable to litigate this action with Mr Vinnicombe because of a lack of funding and because of what it judges to be his substantial resources in this matter. It would be a grave matter if Mr Vinnicombe were able to get back in the saddle and become a professional cyclist without suffering the same sort of penalty as every other athlete who cheats on his colleagues. I hope that ultimately, if there is funding necessary, it will be made available to the Council to deal with this matter in the way that it ought quite properly be dealt with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take the time of the Senate tonight to raise a small matter in relation to the operations of the Civil Aviation Authority, particularly as they relate to safety. On many occasions I have expressed a concern at the direction the Civil Aviation Authority has taken and I do not wish to expand on that tonight beyond reaffirming my position. I think the level of professional expertise within the Department is the lowest it has ever been in modern times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my major concerns is about safety. We had the extraordinary situation in the Department of the adoption of a policy of affordable safety as the doctrine for the last two or three years. As an old airman, I simply do not know what affordable safety means. Does it mean that we can afford safety provided that one's wife or one's children are not killed? It is a concept that I do not understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I understand about aviation is that it is one of the most unforgiving of all environments in which human beings operate and that we cannot pay too much attention to the requirements of safety, design, maintenance and operational practices. It has been by relentless pursuit of those objectives that the high safety level has been reached in Australia. The concept that somehow or other we can quantify safety in monetary terms and set a standard of affordable safety is something that is quite alien to me. I do not wish to go down that path tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relevance of that is that one of the changes that has come to the Department has been the professed belief that officers of the Department are not policemen; they are there as friends and any infringements of operating practice would be met by counselling and education. Last year we approved the introduction of administrative fines, so there was a third barrier introduced before people went to court. We had great assurances from the Minister that the Authority was kind and  benevolent and understanding and certainly not there in a hectoring or bullying mode at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In two of the recent Bills that have been through this Senate I have raised the matter of the qualifications of inspectors for the CAA. At page 5353 of the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 21 June last year I made the point that we were giving great powers to inspectors. In the committee stage Senator Collins responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, for obvious reasons it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>meaning the CAA&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">does not appoint to these positions people who are not suitably qualified.</PARA>
<PARA>At page 5354 he went on to say about people who were inspectors for the CAA:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . they are investigating breaches of civil aviation regulations and, therefore, they are expert in the aviation field.</PARA>
<PARA>Later he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people are expert in the areas that they have to implement. But it is unnecessary in this legislation to spell out the qualifications of inspectors as it would be in a police Act . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I know of at least one inspector who, before he got into that position a year or two ago, had no aviation experience at all, yet he was investigating technical breaches of aviation matters. Putting that aside, my concern is this business of how the Department reacts. I received a letter recently from a constituent in Queensland. The letter was written to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, and it will, in time, be a public document. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sir,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I write to inform you of the CAA's actions against me. I am a farmer and was flying over my property when I discovered a group making an illegal stock movement through my property. They had undone the fences to facilitate their movement, they were not on a stock route and had not sought permission. It was a blatant trespass.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I realised I had caught them red handed but from my altitude of 500 ft I could not see who they were. So I descended and made a low pass to have a look.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I went to the police who said that the law of trespass was full of holes and there was little I could do. The trespassers complained to the CAA and now I have a summons for flying below 500 ft. Where is the justice in the system? It was suggested by my local member of parliament that if I had witnessed a murder being committed and flew below 500 ft to try and stop or apprehend somebody, would the CAA treat me in a similar way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Norman Brown</PARA>
<PARA>I find that absolutely astonishing. We have a farmer flying over his own land; he sees a group of stock illegally on his property&mdash;permission has not been sought. He sees that fences are down. What would any normal human being do? If that happens over my property and I am flying over it, I will certainly do everything within my powers to determine what is going on and take whatever actions I find appropriate to apprehend those people. I find that astonishing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worse than that. The Civil Aviation inspector came out to his property and said, `We've got a few little questions we would like to ask you&mdash;nothing serious'. The farmer said, `That's fine. Come in, have a cup of tea'. So they sat down and they spent hours talking about it. The farmer told the inspector precisely what he had done and what the circumstances were. In other words, he incriminated himself. It would have been quite possible for the farmer to say, `I don't know anything about the incident; I am not prepared to discuss it'. Then it would have been up to the people illegally moving through his property to somehow establish that he was below 500 feet. He could have claimed that since it was his own land he would have been legally entitled to land on it and that his pass was an approach for a precautionary landing or something like that. He could have covered himself in a thousand different ways, but being an honest person he just told the truth. His thanks for that is to have a summons dropped on him by the Civil Aviation Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That incident does nothing at all to encourage air safety. It does nothing to encourage people to be frank and open with the Department when they have problems. This man has had 18 years of flying experience. He has had no brushes with the CAA, no infringements, no breaches of the law at all. I find it quite extraordinary that that should happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association had a matter of concern in relation to the stated policy of the Civil Aviation Authority. On 16 August 1991 it received a letter from Mr Ron Cooper, the general manager of safety and regulation standards. It had made an inquiry as to what procedures&mdash;this was in advance of the farmer's incident&mdash;would be followed by the Department in the case of breaches of the law. The reply of one paragraph by Mr Cooper to AOPA says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your recollection of my words is correct and we will be following the sequential process of education, counselling, administrative fines, prosecutions.</PARA>
<PARA>There from the man who is in charge of the Department is reaffirmation of the policy the CAA and the Government have given us on the operations of the Civil Aviation Authority. I support that policy. I think it is wise to talk to people and tell them where they have gone wrong, to counsel them so that they do not make mistakes. Most of these mistakes are generally made out of innocence or ignorance; they are not done intentionally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have this facility of fining, which is something like a traffic fine. The Government introduced that last year. Finally, we take them to court, which is a last resort. This was not followed in this case. I bring it to the attention of the Senate tonight because I do not think it aids the operations of the Civil Aviation Authority to have that sort of incident occurring in its name. I do not think it aids the advancement of safe operating practices in the country when someone is persecuted in the way this man is going to be because he was obviously concerned about his farm and his own stock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very hard to make a living off the land at present. One of the notoriously  sensitive areas to any cattle owner, as Senator Brownhill would know, is the matter of cattle</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I advised the Minister that I would be saying something about the Civil Aviation Authority.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Multiple Agency Processing System (MAPS) is a Department of Social Security (DSS) computer system. Its function is to pay Formal Training Assistance (FTA) to some participants in formal training courses approved through Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">FTA consists of a living component, equivalent to a participant's entitlement to Job Search Allowance or Newstart Allowance (JSA/NSA), a training component ($30 per week for full-time trainees over 21 years and sole parents) and ancillary allowances such as Fares, Living-Away-From-Home Allowance and compulsory course costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">MAPS pays the FTA training component and ancillary allowances to those trainees who are not in receipt of JSA/NSA, for example pensioners. Currently, part-time trainees who do receive JSA/NSA are also paid their FTA training component and ancillary allowances through MAPS; however, this group will be paid through the DSS Newstart system in the near future. MAPS only pays the $30 training component and ancillary allowances. MAPS clients continue to receive their general income support through normal means; for example pensioners continue to receive their pensions from the DSS Pension system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) MAPS makes FTA payments in response to client data input from DEET's MAPS Data Input Unit (MDIU). The MDIU receives this data from claim forms sent to it by CES offices. The MDIU commenced operation early in July 1991. As of January 1992, DEET has spent some $24,000 to establish and operate the MDIU, excluding salaries, whilst DSS has spent $36,500 on the development of MAPS and a further $24,500 in ongoing maintenance and enhancement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The previous system of payment of FTA became redundant with the incorporation of FTA payments in Job Search and Newstart Allowances from 1 July 1991. The MAPS system was developed for FTA clients not in receipt of JSA or NSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) DSS's Newstart system was established in July 1991 to pay JSA/NSA. FTA recipients in receipt of JSA/NSA are paid their entitlements via the Newstart system. Non-JSA/NSA clients and part-time trainees (that is MAPS clients) could not be paid by the Newstart system without costly system re-development. This re-development could not be justified considering the small group of clients involved. MAPS was developed to pay FTA to these clients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Before 1 July 1991, all FTA recipients had their claims processed in a way similar to the current MAPS system through DSS Central Benefits Offices located in capital cities. The great majority of FTA recipients, who are in receipt of JSA/NSA, now have their claims processed via an electronic interface between CES offices and DSS regional offices. This innovation has resulted in a major reduction in payment delays and problems for the large majority of FTA clients. As substantial changes to the method of payment of FTA to nonJSA/NSA clients were not made, extensive system trialling was not necessary. The MAPS computer system has operated effectively since its introduction, and has been free of any substantial technical misfunction.</PARA>

A number of FTA trainees did not appear as current clients on DSS's system at the time of transfer and therefore their records were suspended, causing payment delays. In addition, since then, there have been reports of payment delays, generally caused by inaccurate provision of financial institution codes, tax file numbers, and bank account numbers by clients on their FTA claim forms as well as some miscoding by CES staff.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The fees and Medicare benefits applicable for an operation which consists of two or more surgical procedures carried out by the one surgeon (or more than one surgeon where they assist each other) and performed on a patient on the one occasion are calculated according to the `multiple operation formula'. That is, the Schedule fee for the second and subsequent procedures are discounted by 50 and 75 per cent respectively and Medicare benefits are then assessed on the aggregate of the fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 15 of the Health Insurance Act 1973 specifies the multiple operation provisions. This legislative requirement has been part of the health insurance arrangements since 1953.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reduction in the fee for the second and subsequent procedures takes account of a number of</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">factors. Although the actual operating time for each procedure may be the same, there would be no additional time involved for the surgeon in arranging and preparing for surgery, and such procedures would have a common after-care period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is felt that the Medicare Benefits Schedule fee structure, of which this rule is a component part, reflects a reasonable return for surgical services. It is relevant that the Australian Medical Association also advocates the application of the multiple operation rule in its List of Medical Services and Fees.</PARA>
