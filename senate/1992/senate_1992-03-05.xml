<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">INTRODUCTION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the 9th September 1991, I introduced a draft of a Bill to establish mechanisms to protect endangered species and to redress the processes in the bush that are threatening the extinction of a large number of our uniquely Australian plants and animals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intent of introducing the Bill in draft form was to give the parliament and the community sufficient time to consider the contents of the proposed legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation and the necessary government and community support structures are absolutely vital if we are to begin the long process of protecting and restoring the great biological diversity on this continent which has contributed greatly to our material, spiritual and cultural well being.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The draft Bill has been circulating in the community for some 6 months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During that time, over 3,000 copies of my accompanying speech and over 2,000 copies of the draft Bill have been distributed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am heartened and gratified at the level of interest expressed in what this Bill hopes to achieve. We have received over one hundred submissions from conservation and farmer organisations, and many letters of support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of this consultation I have made a number of substantial amendments to the draft Bill. These changes will be discussed later in this address.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But first, I think it is important to reiterate some of the reasons for introducing such legislation into the parliament at this time, and to remind Senators of the context in which the Australian Democrats see such legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to the United Nations Environment Program, "Estimates of the number of living species on Earth vary from 5 million to 30 million, of which only 1.4 million have been identified and classified. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They state that "though there is no precise estimate of the number of species that have been lost,. . . experts believe that 25 percent of the Earth's total biological diversity is at risk of extinction during the next 20 to 30 years. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This current problem applies as much to Australia as anywhere else. In the past 200 years, since the settlement of this continent by Europeans, Australia is known to have lost 30 large and visible animals and 100 plants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Professor Harry Recher from the University of New England notes that<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> "Most Australians view the continent as vast, unspoiled and underpopulated. Yet in historical times, no other continent has experienced the massive changes in the distribution and abundance of such a large proportion of its vertebrate fauna as has Australia.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many people think that the great extinctions of our wildlife and their habitats occurred in the very early days of European settlement and that damage has all but stopped.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This view could not be further from the truth. The rates of extinction on this continent are as rapid now as they were at any time in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The historical evidence is that most extinctions occurred in Australia within 20 or 30 years of an area being settled. We are still colonising areas, and this same pattern is set to be repeated, particularly in the south-west and north-west of the continent as settlement of these regions intensifies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Traditional conservation methods have not dealt with the problem of species and habitat loss adequately. This has been recognised by the IUCN when it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The best way to slow the loss of biodiversity is through diverse, coordinated, and participatory programs that attack the problem at its roots, builds support among wide-ranging institutions and individuals, draws on the best modern science, and establishes biodiversity conservation in its rightful place as a basic prerequisite of development policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">This statement provided the thinking on which the structure of this Bill is based.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we have in this Bill is not just legislation to protect an endangered species, but wide ranging programs to protect species, populations of threatened species, and the ecological communities on which they depend for their continued survival and evolutionary development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">A 5 STEP PLAN TO SAVE OUR BIODIVERSITY</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my speech introduced with the draft Bill, I announced a 5 point plan that I believe can and should be adopted to reverse the threatening processes in our natural and rural environments. The Threatened Species Bill is one important part of this plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>What we had in Australia 200 years ago was an ecological balance. That balance has been disrupted by the massive modifications brought about by European Australians since then.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The more we move away from that balance, the less stable our environment and the greater the chance of major environmental problems occurring. This suggested five point plan is about beginning to redress the causes of the disruption of that original balance and to help the continent to establish a new balance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Extinction occurs at the level of populations and not at the level of species. It is a symptom of larger problems with the way we manage our environment in an unsustainable manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of this, conservation strategies must focus on managing for population viability. Fragmented, one off solutions to environmental management have failed. We need a new approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Democrats 5 point plan for protecting the life support systems on which our society and economy is based consists of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* increased funding for threatened species;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* increased funding for Landcare groups;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* increased funding for biological research;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* better management of renewable natural resources; and finally</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* federal legislation to protect endangered species.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Step 1: Funding for threatened species</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government proudly boasts an Endangered Species Program, and provided funding of $5 million this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This represents 0.005% of the Federal budget. The Federal Government's current funding for endangered species represents about 31 cents a year for each Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current Labor Government spent more on landscaping the grounds around Parliament House, than they have spent on saving species in Australia in the past three years. And even the $5 million budget is about to be slashed by 20 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a nation, we were able to plan a 25 year Snowy Mountains Scheme to help improve our economic wellbeing, but it appears a far simpler task of providing funding certainty to repair our natural environment cannot be done. That of course is a nonsense&mdash;the problem in not the inability to provide certainty, it is the lack of political will to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia must prepare, in consultation with conservation, industry, farm, fishing and forestry groups, a 200 year Australian conservation plan, which contains action plans, and funding targets for a least the first 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 200 year plan must integrate the management of all extinction threatening processes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* the loss of habitat;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* protecting endangered species, populations and ecological communities, and;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* controlling the numbers, type and range of many feral animals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By 1994-95 funding for this threatened species program should reach $100 million per annum:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* $40 million should be for habitat protection;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* $30 million should be to ensure the survival of species, and;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* $30 million should be for the control of feral animals and introduced plants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Step 2: An enhanced Landcare program</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing Landcare program is an excellent initiative of the government, in that it encourages local communities to become directly involved in the conservation of their local environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However the funding of Landcare is not adequate to meet the task.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CSIRO for example, claims that "since European settlement some 52 per cent of Australia's agricultural and pastoral lands have been degraded and are now in need of reclamation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current program should be expanded and restructured. Funding levels for this program should commence at $90 million in 1991-92 and increase to $170 million by 1993-94.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This proposal has received a deal of comment from the community, particularly as people are now beginning to recognise after the massive problems with the blue-green algae infestation in the Darling and Murray Rivers, that our catchments are under great stress and in urgent need of repair.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of these submissions, the Australian Democrats will soon be calling for comment on processes that should be put into place to help our rural landholders improve the ecological health of our catchments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Step 3: Biological information</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is critical to the management of our natural environment that we know what it consists of and how species interact with each other. Without the basic information about the environment which we inhabit, it is impossible to plan an ecologically sustainable future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However the level of funding given to this task at present is so inadequate that the work will not be completed until the year 3000!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is clearly ridiculous and the government should set a priority to have the data base of all known flora and fauna completed in time for the bicentenary of Federation in 2001.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This can be achieved with funding of a paltry $24 million per annum, providing such funding is guaranteed for the next 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Step 4: Sustained yield harvesting</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government should get serious about the long term management of our natural resources through proper research, monitoring and setting sustainable catch/harvest limits on our renewable resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not occurring at present and they are simply depleting our environmental capital to hold up a poorly managed economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government should abandon its proposed Resource Security legislation. Instead it should be placing a real price on the value of our publicly owned renewable resources, such as the timber in our native forests, and allow plantation forestry to become economically viable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the moment it is actually subsidising an inefficient and environmentally destructive industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Step 5: Legislation to protect endangered species</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Step 5 is the legislative component of the programs just suggested, which can be implemented by the Federal Government supporting a Bill to protect endangered species and their habitats.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation which is proposed in this Threatened Species Bill gives the Federal Government power to protect threatened species and their habitats.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It encourages the States and Territories to establish their own Threatened Species legislation, and provides for Commonwealth financial assistance to do so. It also gives the Federal government overriding powers to protect species if the States fail to take appropriate action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">CONTENTS OF THE BILL</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The draft Bill which was circulated for public comment in September last year has had a number of substantial amendments. The major amendments relate to addressing the financial impact that this legislation is likely to have on rural landholders, and on the structure and administrative processes in implementing the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Objectives</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The objectives of the Threatened Species Bill are to redress the fundamental problems facing Australia in the continuing loss of its biodiversity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill identifies six objectives which address this problem. They are to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) ensure that threatened species, populations and ecological communities can survive and flourish;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) ensure that threatened species, populations and ecological communities retain their genetic diversity and potential for evolutionary development in their natural habitat;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) prevent further species, populations and ecological communities from becoming endangered;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) encourage the States by way of resources and financial incentives, to introduce complimentary threatened species legislation;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) provide programs-</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) of community education in the conservation of flora and fauna; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) to encourage co-operative management of flora and fauna between government authorities, corporations, landholders, community groups and individuals; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) assist other nations and negotiate international treaties to protect the biological heritage of humankind.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We, the Australian Democrats, believe that government alone cannot achieve the conservation of biodiversity. The community must be involved in all aspects of planning, development and implementation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, we have developed structures and processes in this Bill which facilitate community co-operation and involvement, not only in the listing of threatened species, but also in the management of plans to protect them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Commonwealth Threatened Species Management Committee is established which is to have a major influence in the management of threatened species. This Committee comprises three government appointed officers, two people representing conservation organisations, two people representing rural interests and two people representing the scientific community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The responsibilities of the Management Committee include overseeing the preparation of a Commonwealth Threatened Species Conservation Strategy, managing the Threatened Species Conservation Fund, and recommending to the Minister the signing of Species Recovery Plans and Threatening Process Action Plans. These will be discussed in more detail in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recognition of the role Australia should play in maintaining global biodiversity this Bill establishes an Australian International Threatened Species Advisory Committee. The purpose of this second Committee is to give guidance to Australian representatives on international agencies and to assist international bodies in the implementation of international treaties relating to the protection and conservation of threatened species. It will not play a role in the protection of Australia's threatened species, which is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Threatened Species Management Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To help the Management Committee deal with the purely scientific aspects of protecting threatened species, and to assist the Minister in determining whether to list a species, population or ecological community, a Scientific Advisory Panel is established to make purely scientific judgements and recommendations concerning the listing of threatened species.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>The Bill also ensures the on-going function of the Endangered Species Unit (to be renamed the Threatened Species Unit) within the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is felt that the specialist nature of threatened species recovery warrants the continued functioning of a separate unit within the ANPWS. The Unit is to provide administrative resources to the Commonwealth Threatened Species Management Committee, the Australian International Threatened Species Advisory Committee and the Scientific Advisory Panel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am confident that this Bill will take species conservation out of the hands of the bureaucracy and place it firmly in the care of the people who have the greatest interest in conserving our native species, namely the landholders of Australia, conservation groups and the scientific community. These groups will provide an appropriate and comprehensive level of protection to Australia's threatened species.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Threatened Species Action Plans</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The purpose of the Bill is to identify and then implement programs to protect threatened species, populations and ecological communities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To do this four distinct mechanisms are proposed: A Threatened Species Conservation Strategy; Action Plans (to remove threats to species); Recovery Plans (to help protect species in the wild); and Habitat Management Agreements (to help landholders help the recovery process).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>Commonwealth Threatened Species Conservation Strategy<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Threatened Species Conservation Strategy is to ensure the survival and evolutionary development in the wild of all species, populations and ecological communities, and to promote the importance of conserving biodiversity through a community education program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>Recovery Plans</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of a Species Recovery Plan is to devise specific strategies to protect and conserve a threatened species, population or ecological community. A Recovery Plan must state what has to be done to ensure the recovery of that species, population or ecological community to a position of viability in the wild.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, a recovery plan may be developed for the bilby which identifies the bilby's recovery range and actions to take to protect the recovery range. Each plan will also provide estimates of costs, the time period of each plan, and the assistance and compensation to be given to landholders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Action Plans<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Threatening Process Action Plans are to be developed to identify and reverse the processes which pose a threat to biodiversity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The difference between Recovery Plans and Action Plans is that Recovery Plans are species, population and community specific, whereas Action Plans are aimed at redressing more widespread processes that are causing species to become threatened.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two examples of threatening processes are the impacts of feral animals such as foxes, cats and rabbits, and the clearing of native vegetation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without such Action Plans, activities which threaten biodiversity will continue to accelerate and Recovery Plans will simply represent islands in an ever rising sea of threatening processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Threatened Species Management Committee will have to prioritise Action Plans within the financial constraints imposed on them by their budget allocations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those Plans that are likely to positively affect the largest number of species in the shortest available time should receive the highest priority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Habitat Management Agreements<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for Habitat Management Agreements<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>which are vehicles to encourage landholders to assist in the implementation of Recovery Plans and Action Plans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agreements are to include provisions for assistance and compensation to landholders<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>, and incentives for one or more persons or public authorities to enter into Habitat Management Agreement<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>s. I will describe these in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Funding</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Threatened Species Conservation Corporation and Fund are also established. The Corporation's purpose is to raise money from the private sector to help finance the conservation measures provided for in this Bill. The fund will consist of money raised by the Corporation, money appropriated by Parliament, penalties payable in respect of offences against this Bill and fees payable in respect of applications for a permit to interfere. I will discuss this permit procedure later on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I discussed earlier, funding for threatened species conservation is abysmally low. The Democrats have developed a 10 year budget for the funding of the Commonwealth Threatened Species Conservation Strategy which we believe will provide funding levels commensurate with the importance of conserving our unique biodiversity. According to this budget, in 1992-93 a total of $50 million should be allocated to the Strategy. By 1994-95 the total amount should be upgraded to $100 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that Australians will readily support the expenditure of $50 million of public funds in the first year to implement the provisions of this Bill if they are satisfied that the money will help protect our precious and irreplaceable Australian wildlife.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Three dollars a year for each Australian to save and repair our natural heritage is, in our opinion, a deposit on the heritage we leave to our children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Compensation and Assistance for Landholders</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats believe that individual landholders should be provided with appropriate levels of compensation and assistance to<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS> carry out species conservation measures on behalf of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The draft Bill made provision for compensation to landholders where Interim and Permanent Conservation Orders are established. However, the limited extent of this compensation was strongly criticised by landholder groups, such as the National Farmers Federation, the United Farmers &amp; Stockowners of South Australia, and the Tasmanian Farmers &amp; Graziers Association.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have given serious consideration to their criticisms and have, on balance, found them to be valid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have therefore, substantially amended the draft and now include provisions for full compensation to landholders where any action taken under this Bill would have an adverse financial impact on the legitimate existing use of a landholders property.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, if a landholder was asked to destock a portion of the property to protect a threatened habitat, then the landholder could legitimately claim compensation for the loss of productive capacity from that part of the property, even though the land would still remain in his or her ownership and management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was put to me strongly, and I fully respect the argument, that if a landholder's property happens to include threatened species, it is not exclusively that landholder's responsibility that the species is now threatened.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is therefore a breach of natural justice to require that landholder to suffer a financial loss to preserve a species on behalf of the entire Australian community. It is a national responsibility to protect threatened species, and landholders who are asked or required to assist in their protection should receive full compensation for interference with their economic production.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Landholders will be compensated for any financial loss suffered as a natural, direct and reasonable consequence of the making of an Interim or Permanent Conservation Order. The amount by which the value of the land will be increased or decreased will be taken into account by the Minister in deciding the landholder's entitlement. The compensation may be given in the form of a payment of money or provision of labour, goods or other services. In addition, any costs associated with a claim for compensation will be met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, landholders who enter into voluntary Habitat Management Agreements will be eligible for financial or other assistance in three areas:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* the restoration or regeneration of native vegetation on their land; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* research in relation to the preservation, enhancement or management of threatened species, populations or ecological communities on or visiting their land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We feel sure that this Bill has improved the financial protection and assistance provided to landholders and that no individual landholder will be financially disadvantaged by any component of this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Permit to Interfere, Environmental Impact Assessment and Licence to Interfere</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill recognises that there will inevitably be situations where actions need to be taken which have a minor impact on threatened species. It therefore provides for a `permit to interfere' with threatened species. The Director of the Threatened Species Unit will only issue permits if he or she is satisfied that the proposed action will not impede the recovery, threaten the extinction, or significantly affect the habitat of Australia's threatened species, populations or ecological communities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a person breaches the permit or if the Director has not rejected an application for a permit outright, the Bill requires the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement. The intent of this section is to require an EIS for new developments that might have a major impact on a species. Where the Minister finds the EIS acceptable, he or she may issue a `licence to interfere'. The developer must enter into an assurity or bond arrangement whereby the impacts of any approved interference must be properly rehabilitated.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The importance of community involvement in species conservation cannot be overemphasised. This component of the Bill will help to nurture an ethic of conservation that is already growing in the Australian community.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Commonwealth Powers to Protect Threatened Species</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill requires the Commonwealth to fully exercise its constitutional powers to protect threatened species, populations and ecological communities.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Species extinction is irreversible. Our present generation is witnessing an alarming rate of species extinction and habitat loss both in Australia and overseas. Determined and enlightened government and community action is required to stem and reverse this loss, both for the sake of future generations and for the preservation of ecological integrity on which we all depend.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current system of conservation reserves in Australia is inadequate to conserve the full range of species existing in Australia today. Management for conservation and development, that is ecologically sustainable development, must be adopted across all industry sectors in order to provide full protection to threatened species. This Bill recognises that, as an island continent, Australia is one interconnected system. It also recognises that the processes that threaten native species do not respect institutional jurisdictions. It therefore provides mechanisms to protect all threatened species, populations and ecological communities across the continent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Global warming poses new and unprecedented threats to biodiversity. The diversity of life on our planet is a result of highly complex interactions between biological, physical and climatic processes. Over many tens of thousands of years, climates have changed quite dramatically, however, the pace of change has been sufficiently slow to allow species to adapt. We are now faced with the prospect of an accelerated greenhouse effect. Uncertainty exists only about the speed and scale of change. Scientists have warned that the rate may be too fast to allow species to adapt. Climate zones are likely to move, leaving whole ecological communities to the mercy of weather patterns to which they have not adapted. Without the adoption of effective precautionary action, massive increases in species extinction are likely. To hedge against this alarming prospect, the government must act now to set in train processes which protect our most threatened species.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Future generations of Australians are relying on this government to take a bold step and to conserve a part of our heritage that once lost can never be replaced. The loss of any species due to human action or inaction diminishes our humanness. I urge you all to give your serious consideration to this Bill which we, the Democrats, believe will provide a strong and effective role for the Commonwealth in the protection of Australia's threatened species. Future generations will thank you for doing so.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill now before the Senate seeks to implement three initiatives announced in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> statement. First of all, all recipients of family allowance, as of 2 April 1992, will receive a one-off lump sum payment. This payment will be $125 for families with one child, $175 for families with two children, $200 for families with three children, $225 for those with four children, and $250 for those with five or more children. This one-off payment will cost $317m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, the rate of family allowance supplement and the family allowance supplement component of pensions and benefits will increase by $6 a fortnight. This increase will be implemented on 3 April for pensioner and beneficiary families and 16 April for low income working families. The increase will be indexed for inflation when the Government introduces legislation to integrate family payments. This initiative will cost $50m this financial year and upwards of $250m for each subsequent financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Third, from 20 March 1992, the Government will abolish the waiting period for rent assistance for all pensioners and beneficiaries apart from those aged under 18 years who are not married and have no dependent children. The decision will cost $15m this financial year and between $34m and $50m for each of the three subsequent financial years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I comment briefly on these three initiatives, I would like to reiterate the Opposition's support for this Bill. As Dr Hewson pointed out so clearly and succinctly in his reply to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> statement, Australian families are suffering greatly as a result of Mr Keating's deliberately engineered recession. There are 920,000 people who are officially unemployed in Australia, while another half a million people are unable to get the hours of work that they want. One in three young people cannot find work. Over the past year, the number of families where the chief breadwinner is unemployed has risen by 40 per cent to 262,000. There are now 218,000 Australian children living in families in which no-one has a job. I should repeat the figure because it is alarming&mdash;218,000 Australian children living in families in which no-one has a job. That is a 40 per cent increase on the figure just a year ago. They are damning figures for this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this setting of personal hardship, it would be niggardly for the Opposition not to support these changes, which will, to an extent, alleviate the financial hardship currently being felt by hundreds of thousands of Australian families. In spite of the coalition's support for these measures, we have a number of concerns which need to be put on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The special family allowance bonus will be paid to all family allowance recipients, irrespective of income. As such, it verges on a regressive payment. A family with one child and an annual income of $62,000 will receive the same $125 one-off bonus as a family with one child and no income will receive. Likewise, a family with five children and an income of $74,000 will receive the same $250 one-off payment as a family with five children and little or no income will receive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This one-off payment could never be described as an efficient means of targeting government assistance to the most needy in the community. It is quite the opposite, in fact. Families who will remain virtually unaffected by the current recession and enjoy a relatively high standard of living will receive a one-off windfall from the Government in early April. Those families who have been able to shield themselves, relatively, from the effects of this recession will get this as well. Whether these families will spend the windfall payment on necessities and not luxuries is highly debatable. The question must be asked: how much of this $317m of taxpayer's money will be spent by higher income families on luxury purchases and entertainment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A significant proportion of this handout will go to families that do not have a dire need for it. Analysis of the 1986 ABS income distribution survey, with subsequent income updates in line with the CPI, reveals that there are some 700,000 Australian families with incomes over $40,000 a year receiving family allowance. This includes some 100,000 families with incomes over $60,000 a year. The survey reveals that some 530,000 families have incomes under $20,000 a year, while 790,000 families have incomes between $20,000 and $40,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be pointed out that the Department of Social Security does not release its own figures on family allowance recipients broken down according to income. The figures from which I have quoted show that 35 per cent, or over one-third, of families receiving family allowance have incomes in excess of $40,000 a year. A significant amount of money could have been saved by targeting this payment to families in greatest financial need. Even in the case of lower income families, who in the main will be able to put this payment to very good use, such as paying off bills and buying necessities for their children, it will not mean an ongoing improvement in their standard of living. To an extent it may minimally alleviate the hardship for a short time. However, once the one-off payment has been spent, these lower income families will again face the harrowing task of paying bills and dealing with a constant flow of demands on their limited resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the $317m the Government is spending on this initiative it could have given over $5 to every family allowance family for a full year; better still, it could have targeted this assistance to lower income families and provided them with a substantial and sustained increase in their overall standard of living. Only last November the Government introduced an assets test for family allowance, claiming the need to target assistance to families who are most in need. But now, in the run-up to both the Wills by-election and a Victorian State election, and with the knowledge that Fightback has captured the support of what is called middle Australia, the Government has opted for a one-off across the board payment to all family allowance recipients. Mr Keating's self-styled prescription for social justice, which is evident in his decision, is most identifiable in the One Nation decision to exclude four million people, or nearly half of Australia's taxpayers, with incomes under $20,700 a year from the Government's tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A final point needs to be made about this one-off family allowance payment. Because of its arbitrary nature, it discriminates against needy families who are not eligible for family allowance on 2 April 1992. For example, in the 1990-91 Budget the Government announced that from 1 January 1993 the family allowance would not automatically stop when a child turned 16 but would be paid until the completion of the student's secondary schooling. As this initiative will not commence until 1 January 1993, these families will not benefit from the one-off payment on 2 April 1992, even though they have already been earmarked for family allowance in the 1990-91 Budget and are just as needy as those families who will benefit. Presumably the Government's 1990-91 Budget decision to extend family allowance to school students aged 16 to 18 is based upon its own recognition of the large increase in school retention rates. However, by arbitrarily applying this one-off payment to eligible families at 2 April and not applying it to secondary school Austudy recipients, the Government is in effect choosing to ignore the increased costs being borne by families due to the large rise in school retention rates during the current recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's one-off payment, irrespective of income, has to be compared with the targeted increase in family allowance outlined in Fightback. Rather than a one-off payment of between $125 and $250, a coalition government will double family allowance for families with incomes under $30,000&mdash;not a one-off payment; a doubling of family allowance to enable a sustained increased in standard of living. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To respond to the interjection from Senator McMullan on the other side, who said that this would help us pay for the GST: families on low incomes have been paying a whopping increase in wholesale sales tax since Labor has been in government and there has been no compensation for that at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike Labor's one-off payment, the increases in family allowance contained in Fightback are targeting low income families. Unlike Labor's one-off payment, Fightback will mean a sustained improvement in the ongoing standard of living of Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to spend a lot of time talking about the $6 a fortnight increase in the family allowance supplement contained in this Bill. As I said earlier, the coalition supports this initiative as it will help to alleviate some of the hardship faced by families in the current recession. However, unlike the one-off family allowance payment, it is targeted at lower income families and will mean an ongoing increase in their standard of living. For these reasons it is welcomed by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be pointed out, however, that this Government does not have a mortgage on compassion for low income families. Far from it. Fightback provides for a 6 per cent increase in the family allowance supplement. It also provides an 8 per cent increase in all pensions, including the sole parent pension, and a 6 per cent increase in all other benefits, including Jobsearch allowance and Newstart allowance. Fightback also provides a $300 increase in the dependent spouse rebate for one income families with children who have an income under $75,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, and unlike Labor, the coalition's tax cuts quite deliberately and unashamedly favour low income earners. Under a coalition government, 95 per cent of taxpayers will pay tax at the marginal rate of 30c or lower. The coalition is offering the largest tax cuts in this country's history. Under the coalition's tax regime a person earning up to $75,000 a year will face a lower marginal rate of tax than now applies to those earning just $20,701 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In stark contrast, the Government's tax cuts announced in last week's One Nation statement did not even apply to the vast majority of families who receive the family allowance supplement. Mr Keating's tax cuts will apply only to people who earn more than $20,701 a year, and I presume that, if Labor stays in government&mdash;which it will not&mdash;wholesale sales tax will keep increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Will Labor tell us all the things in the supermarket on which wholesale sales tax is increasing? I can think of one thing, without naming it, which is used very frequently, and  is bought in supermarkets and in pharmacies, which has increased, I think, by $1.57 to $7.00 because of a wholesale sales tax increase from 20 to 30 per cent. Do not tell the public about those things, Senator McMullan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Government has deserted its traditional heartland. It is giving to low income earners in one hand by increasing the family allowance supplement but taking from the other hand by excluding these very same people from its proposed tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third initiative in this Bill is the abolition of rent assistance waiting periods for all beneficiaries, excluding people under 18 who are unmarried and without dependants. The coalition supports the initiative, given the fact that there is little hope of finding work in the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of points need to be made about the abolition of rent assistance waiting periods. It needs to be remembered that only in the last Budget the Government decided to reduce these waiting periods from 26 weeks to 18 weeks. That was only in the last Budget. By now abolishing waiting periods altogether, the Government is in effect admitting that at the time of the last Budget it underestimated the financial hardship faced by people caught up in the recession. I suppose that some people in the bureaucracy believed Mr Keating's repeated promise that we would somehow come out of this recession; the J-curve would come into effect; that he would bring home the bacon; that there was just a bit of effervescence in the glass and everything would be okay. Even Mr Keating's own bureaucrats began to believe the myths that he was putting forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it must be pointed out that the relaxation of rent assistance waiting periods proposed in this Bill does not appear to be a temporary initiative to alleviate the extra hardship resulting from the recession. This is a disturbing phenomenon. For a number of years both the Government and the Opposition have considered it appropriate for rent assistance to be available as soon as a person became eligible for a benefit. This thinking has been based on a common concern that making rental assistance a de facto benefit would merely increase the incentive for people to rely on welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a deep recession such as this, I do not believe that such an argument is as relevant because it is virtually impossible for people to switch back and forth between employment and welfare benefits at will. In fact, it is very difficult for people to get employment at all. However, the apparent permanency of this decision to abolish rent assistance waiting periods does indicate a significant change-around in the Government's policy. I think that the Minister should confirm or deny that the Government intends to return to its previous policy once this long running recession is over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of concern to me that the benefits given, in the first part of the Bill especially, are not targeted more effectively. I believe that the Australian public will see the One Nation policy for what it is: a sham and a vote buying exercise, rather than a realistic vision for turning this country around and ensuring that those people who are now unemployed have more hope in the future and that the one in three young Australians currently unemployed have a hope for their young adulthood and their later life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill contains the mechanism for the introduction of the three social security measures announced as part of the Government's One Nation package: the one-off payment of a family allowance bonus to all those families presently eligible for family allowance; an increase in the child amounts paid to certain pensioners, beneficiaries and families receiving family allowance supplement; and the abolition of rent assistance waiting periods for most social security recipients.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to explore these three separate measures in some detail. However, firstly, I want to look at the more general social justice implications of the One Nation package. This package is really a most disappointing one for those people in this country who have borne the brunt of Paul Keating's recession and who are now unemployed or trying to survive on very low incomes. Perhaps the best that can be said for the One Nation package is that it has marginally more to offer the low and middle income earners in particular than does the Opposition's Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is really the great tragedy of the standard of the political and economic debate in this country at the moment. We have finally come down to some sort of contest&mdash;an auction, if you like&mdash;between two packages that are not much more than the same tired old economic theories tarted up, wrapped up in fancy packaging, trying to look like something new. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, both the Government and the Opposition's packages really fail to come to grips with the basic issue facing us today; that is, how can we pull ourselves out of the present recession by pursuing both sustainable economic development and greater social justice? It is this latter point about social justice that I particularly want to take up in the context of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there may be room for debate about the comparative merits of some other aspects of the packages, one thing is pretty clear: genuine social justice for those Australians and their families relying on social security payments or other sources of low income is well and truly on the bottom of both the Government's and the Opposition's agendas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Geoffrey Baker observed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> earlier this week: . . . both the Government and the Opposition have wept crocodile tears over Australia's poor&mdash;and structured their economic packages to maximise the votes of the relatively affluent majority rather than to seriously improve the relative position of the poor minority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So Australians concerned about social equity in income distribution are really facing a choice between the lesser of two evils.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact of the matter is that Australia's poor will not find much to celebrate in either the Fightback or the One Nation packages. The former is a blueprint for putting the coalition's scorched earth economic policies into practice, while One Nation is an exercise in political survival&mdash;long on rhetoric and populist appeal, short on the real courage needed to change economic direction and to place our first priority on getting this country as close as we possibly can to genuinely full employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn back to the specific measures that are dealt with in this legislation. Firstly, I refer to that one-off payment. The Government proposes to pay a one-off bonus to every family eligible for family allowance on 2 April. The bonus payment ranges from $125 for a family with one child up to $250 for a family with five or more children. Although the bonus will undoubtedly be welcomed by the families receiving it, this is really a somewhat bizarre move by the Government. It comes wrapped up in the guise of a social justice measure, but one can only ask: what is the real purpose? Is it a bribe? Is it a bit of pork-barrelling? Does it have anything to do with a by-election that seems to be rapidly approaching? Is it tokenism of the worst kind, or maybe an off-beat attempt to stimulate the economy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Its political appeal is obvious, and I for one do not begrudge families what is really pretty minimal assistance, no matter how cynically it has been engineered. But the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) have presented this measure not only as one being useful to people with dependent children, but also as one providing an immediate boost or kick-start to consumer spending.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is rather difficult to see how this claim can be seriously upheld. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, the additional $300m is a mere drop in the ocean of consumer spending. In addition, many of these families will not use the payment to buy consumer goods, despite the urging of the Government. They are far more likely to use it to pay off the debts that they have been accumulating. If they are able to afford to spend this payment, the real risk is that this money will go on imported goods. If the Government is really expecting the payment to stimulate the economy, the least it could do is urge families to use the payment only to purchase Australian goods. As it stands, the $377m boost will, as Ken Davidson put it in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> last week, `hardly cause a ripple on total consumer spending'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a further problem with this bonus and that is that, yet again, many farm families will be missing out. Because of the inequitable way the assets test on family allowance operates, there will be many well-off city families who will be receiving this bonus while families earning very low incomes, in particular farming families, will be excluded. The problem continues to be the failure of the Government to address an equity problem inherent in the family allowance assets test; that is, the continuing exclusion of the family home, but not the family farm, from the test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have urged and argued in this chamber again and again, this exclusion means that city families could own a home of any value, worth any amount, and have many hundreds of thousands of dollars in non-productive assets before they would be caught by the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Patterson has already highlighted a number of other inequitable problems that this supposed targeting of this particular benefit will cause. For example, a family with one child living in Melbourne could have a family home worth $200,000 or $300,000, they could have another $20,000 worth of assets and an annual income of $62,000. No problem; they are eligible for family allowance and therefore they will receive a bonus payment of $125 a week upwards, depending on the number of children.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our problem is that a farm family with an income of only $10,000 will be cut out, while a city family earning $62,000 will be able to receive this payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I believe that the way in which this payment is being made demonstrates very clearly this Government's inability to come to grips with the structural problems of poverty. Yes, families are going to be assisted, but where is the help for those families on very low incomes who have no children? Where is the help for the single people trying to survive on minimal incomes? We certainly welcome the increases in family allowance supplement, the boost for funding for welfare agencies and a reduction in rent assistance waiting periods. We have been calling for such measures for some time. But these are somewhat hollow gestures in the context of a package that accepts around 8 per cent unemployment for at least the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that long term prospect in mind, what does the package do by way of addressing the structural problems of poverty? The short answer is absolutely nothing. Here was a chance to tackle some of those structural problems. For example, the Government could have increased the amount people on pensions and benefits are permitted to earn before losing their entitlement to payment. It could have reinstated young people's incomes back up to the adult level to help them survive. It could have reduced or removed all existing waiting periods for income support, which are constantly causing so much poverty and putting so much pressure on welfare agencies. But the Government has not gone for genuine social justice for the victims of its recession; instead, it has gone for the easy option, the social justice gimmick&mdash;the money, not the structural box. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Before I move on to rent assistance waiting periods, I refer to farm families. There are two ways that we can now make sure that this package will go to those needy farm families. We can either look again at removing the tools of trade from the family allowance assets test or&mdash;and this will help only some of those children in need, but at least it will help some&mdash;we can link the payment not only to the family allowance but also to those children who are currently being assisted under the isolated children's scheme. They are two amendments that we will be pursuing when this Bill moves into the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Turning to rent assistance, the move by the Government to abolish the waiting period for rent assistance for most pensioners and beneficiaries is a most welcome one. It is long overdue, but it is gratifying to see the Government finally acknowledging the hardship and suffering that these waiting periods have been causing. The Democrats are particularly pleased to see this move because we have been calling for the abolition or substantial reduction of social security waiting periods for many years. Over the past two years we have continually moved amendments to social security legislation to give effect to the reductions in waiting periods, only to see those amendments opposed by both the Government and the Opposition. It is quite clear that waiting periods cause considerable and unnecessary hardship and that the sole rationale for their existence is to cut costs rather than relieve the suffering of those people who are forced, through no fault of their own, to turn to the Government for income support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am very pleased to hear Senator Patterson also supporting this measure. It has been most unfortunate that in the past the Liberals seemed determined to see these reductions as some sort of subsidy to the private rental market. I find this quite strange once I look through the Fightback package. The Opposition's desire is actually to reduce the public housing sector, and I wonder where it thinks low income earners are going to live. This view also very conveniently ignores the fact that housing costs consume the highest proportion of low income earners' incomes, especially if they are renting in the private rental market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Data collected by the national housing strategy clearly pinpoints the enormous stresses that housing costs place on many low income families, particularly in times of recession when the breadwinner is unemployed. The strategy's data indicates that about 10 per cent of all households in this country are suffering from very severe housing related stress and that many people are paying out up to 50 per cent of their income on rent. I highlight one big problem with rent assistance, and that is that it is not going to be available to those under 18; they have been left out yet again. I ask the Government why, when this age group has been one of the hardest hit sectors of the community, with one in three unemployed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak only briefly on the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill because I spoke on the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) last Wednesday. This legislation implements that part of the Prime Minister's statement designed to help families kick-start the economy. It contains three elements. The first is a one-off family allowance payment of $125 per child; the second is a $3 increase in the family allowance supplement and the third is the abolition of all rental assistance waiting periods for social security recipients except those waiting periods which apply to single beneficiaries without dependent children who are aged below 18 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition agrees entirely with these measures. However, it seems that this is meant to be the Government's answer to the Fightback package. If that is the answer to the Fightback package in relation to families, it certainly is not enough. I will give a brief description of what the Fightback package does for families, as opposed to what the Prime Minister's package does for families, particularly low-income families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the Government does nothing in relation to tax cuts for people who are on $20,700. A person on that income is paying over $49 and does not get 1c back. The poorest in the community do not get a tax cut; they get not a cent back under this Prime Minister's package. Under the Opposition, someone on $20,000 a year would get $814 back. Taxpayers would not be paying the present 20c in the dollar; they would be paying 16.2c above the initial tax-free amount. Secondly, petrol excise would be abolished and the 15 per cent GST would be applied. So there would be a saving of 18c or 19c for every litre of petrol a family used. There is nothing about a reduction in the price of petrol in the Prime Minister's statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Opposition, the dependent spouse rebate would be worth an additional $300; there is nothing like that in the Government's statement. Indeed, the dependent spouse rebate under the Government would not go up at all. Under the Opposition, the family allowance will be doubled. There is nothing comparable in the Prime Minister's statement except a one-off payment. Senator Lees is quite right; that one-off payment, no doubt, will be used to pay off the odd debt. Under the Opposition, there will be a 6 per cent increase in the family allowance supplement. Under the Government, it will increase by $3 a week. Under the Opposition the increased family allowance will not only be paid to the poor; part of it will be paid to families on incomes of up to $40,000. The Government does nothing for the poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing in the Prime Minister's statement at all about superannuation incentives. We will abolish the tax on lump sums and there will be many incentives for those on low incomes to take out superannuation. People under 35 buying their first home can dip into their superannuation fund for that purpose to the tune of 75 per cent. Under the Opposition, $2,000 will be given to low income earners to help them buy their first home and 50 per cent of the home's valuation will be not be subject to the GST. There is nothing at all in the Government's statement for home buyers. Under the Opposition, that group can save up to $2,000 tax free. There is nothing at all like that in the Government's statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as health goes, we all know that under the Government the problems with Medicare will continue. Nothing is being done about it at all. Under the Opposition, the waiting lists will go. Health costs will be zero rated, so there will be no GST on them. If income earners on $20,000 choose to take out private health cover, they will get a $300 tax credit. There are nearly two million contributors to private health funds, people who put priority on private health cover. They will get a tax credit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no comparison at all between the two policies for low income earners. Our policy will give them a tremendous boost. Under the Government's policy all they get is a one-off payment for family allowance and an additional $3 a week in the family allowance supplement. That will not kick-start the economy. All it will do is allow the people to pay off their debts a little more. Even though we support the measure thoroughly, we say the Government has not gone nearly far enough. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. This Bill, of course, follows last Wednesday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It is an attempt to match the vision and breadth of the coalition's Fightback package and, needless to say, an attempt which falls hopelessly short of the mark.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will, in fact, have very little impact on the veteran community and highlights the fact that Paul Keating's title for his statement, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS>, is a complete misnomer. The discriminatory approach which has been taken with respect to low income Australians has already been well canvassed by my colleagues and by me. The statement provides no tax relief to nearly two million women on low incomes or to the nearly half a million Australians aged 65 and over on low incomes, a substantial number of whom are veterans and war widows. Veterans or war widows would search the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> statement in vain for any measures directly concerning them. There are none. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question must therefore be asked: where do veterans fit into Mr Keating's concept of one nation, of a country, in his own words, civilised enough to take care of those in need?  Surely such a nation can also be civilised enough to properly recognise those who fought to defend its interests. But such recognition is not to be found in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> statement or in the Bill before us. I do not think it can be any coincidence that at the same time as the Prime Minister was launching his statement he was attacking Britain and pushing a republican agenda. He was keen to divert and deflect attention from an inadequate statement and instead to embroil Australia in a debate on republicanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one disputes Australia's status as an independent country with an increasing focus on the South East Asian region. But veterans and war widows have rightly expressed anger at the insensitive, provocative and most unstatesmanlike manner in which the Prime Minister was seeking to make that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before us will increase the add-on payable to a service pensioner in respect of each child by $6 a fortnight. This increase will take effect from 16 April 1992. While I welcome such an increase for those who will benefit, it is interesting to look at how many are affected. As at 30 June last year, approximately 2,100 veterans were receiving an additional pension for children. In a veteran population of several hundred thousand, a little more than 2,000 gain an increase in pension of $6 a fortnight as part of a measure not devised to benefit veterans, in particular, being more a consequence of a general increase in family allowance supplement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So if no account has been taken of the veteran community in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> statement, as reflected in the paucity of the Bill before us, what account has been taken of veterans in the coalition's Fightback package?  I can assure the veteran community that in the measures contained in the Fightback package the coalition has recognised the special standing of veterans in our community and the debt our nation owes to those who fought for our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for a package as broad in its scope as Fightback is plain.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is currently experiencing the worst recession in 60 years. The impact is being felt in all areas of the community, including the veteran community. For example, in 1990-91 the number of veterans applying for a service pension actually increased over the previous year for the first time since 1983-84. This reflects the increasingly difficult circumstances faced by self-funded retired veterans in a time of national recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has never been a greater need than now for a positive program to turn around Australia's economic fortunes, and the coalition's Fightback package is just such a program. It contains plans for tax reform, incentives for business to employ again and many other measures to rebuild Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the interests of veterans are an important element of the package. For instance, an important concern for veterans is the cost of living. It is stated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document that the cost of living increase due to the introduction of a 15 per cent goods and services tax will be a one-off 4.4 per cent. This has been shown by the Government's own analysis to be a conservative estimate. The Government estimates that one-off increase to be only 3.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the important question for repatriation pensioners is: do the compensation proposals put forward by the coalition package ensure that they are not financially disadvantaged as a result of the introduction of a goods and services tax? The answer is yes. When we were framing our package, a particular concern of the coalition was to ensure that veteran pensioners be more than compensated for the one-off increase in the cost of living. Thus, rather than simply increasing all allowances and pensions by 4.4 per cent, we will be increasing them by 6 per cent and 8 per cent respectively. This means that all service pensions, disability pensions and war widow pensions will be increased by 8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a full service pensioner this will be an increase of more than $600 a year. For a TPI pensioner the increase will be more that $1,100 a year and for a veteran receiving 100 per cent of the general rate, the increase will be $435 a year. War widows will have their pensions increased by $678 a year. Veterans on part service pensions and earning non-pension incomes will have their part pension indexed by 8 per cent and will receive a GST tax credit. This will ensure that, after taking into account non-pension incomes, they are fully compensated for the price impact of the GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important concern for retired veterans is protection of the savings they have accumulated for their retirement. The Fightback package ensures protection of such savings by granting a one-off payment to veterans over 60 and earning less than $30,000. I might add that that is not restricted only to veterans over 60; it will be for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the present tax system, TPI veterans and certain other ex-service personnel are not required to pay wholesale sales tax on non-luxury cars and essential spare parts. The coalition is mindful of this special recognition of veterans, and consistent with the coalition's philosophy of at least maintaining present veterans' entitlements and, where possible, enhancing them, this special recognition will be continued after the introduction of the coalition's Fightback package. TPI veterans will not be required to pay GST on new cars or essential spare parts, in line with the eligibility conditions currently in operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Veterans, like many Australians, will benefit from the new tax free savings scheme. Many veterans and their families will be able to earn up to $2,000 in interest on new savings tax free. Veterans who currently do not qualify for any repatriation health benefits will welcome the decision of the coalition to extend the pharmaceutical benefits card to all those aged 65 and over who are currently not receiving any Government concessions and whose incomes are less that $40,000 a year if single and $50,000 a year for a married veteran couple.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Service pensioners will also further benefit from a number of other measures. For instance, the coalition will maintain the current pension indexation arrangements and make the assets test fairer. Service pensioners who wish to remain in the work force beyond the age of 60 and who qualify for the service pension and agree to defer it will receive a bigger pension as a result, at the rate of an extra 8 per cent for each year of deferment. The income and assets test limits applying to service pensions will be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that pensioners are encouraged to earn additional income to supplement their pension without losing benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also contained in the Fightback package are commitments to reform in two important areas of the Veterans' Affairs portfolio. The first is the reform of the repatriation artificial limb and appliance centres, or RALACs. Reviews of the provision of artificial limbs and appliances pointed to serious shortcomings in the efficiency of RALACs and the difficulties facing private manufactures. The coalition believes that positive action must be taken by the Government both for the veteran population and the community generally. The coalition is committed to operating RALACs on a commercial basis with no restrictions on the number of private manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Veterans will benefit from better quality and more efficient supply of artificial limbs and appliances. Veterans can be assured that RALACs will continue to be operated by the Commonwealth and that they will still be able to attend the RALACs if they wish to. Of course, limbs and appliances will continue to be available to veterans free of charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second significant reform to the Veterans' Affairs portfolio in Fightback concerns the claims system. The effectiveness and fairness of the claims system is a matter of great concern to veterans and war widows everywhere. The Government concedes that the system is not operating nearly as well as it should and admits that it has no real solutions. One has only to look at the extraordinarily high percentages of Repatriation Commission decisions overturned by the Veterans' Review Board. In Western Australia, for instance, the Veterans' Review Board in 1990-91 overturned 72 per cent of Repatriation Commission's disability assessment decisions&mdash;obviously totally unacceptable. The Department concedes that the real problems lie at the first level of the determining system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition proposes to reform the system, with a central change being to include more ex-service input into the decision making processes. We believe that if veterans and war widows feel that they have had a fair hearing at the first level and that the system that is confronting them is not unnecessarily legalistic and adversarial, then the Government will be more nearly fulfilling its charter of a commitment to a caring and generous approach in addressing veterans' needs. Importantly, the coalition will discuss at all stages with the veterans' community any changes to be made to the claims system. Veteran input is essential if the changes are to be made in a sensible and timely manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have gone about the country speaking to veterans about the coalition's proposals, and in reading correspondence coming into my office, I have found the overwhelming sentiment to be one of support. Veterans know that the Fightback package offers a real and credible program for dealing with the problems confronting Australia. They also know that the coalition has been particularly sensitive to veterans' concerns. Through deliberately generous increases in pensions and allowances, tax credits for non-pension income, protection of retirement savings and an improved claims system the coalition has reaffirmed its longstanding commitment to the veterans of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its management of the Veterans' Affairs portfolio the Government is going to have to demonstrate greater imagination than it is currently showing if it is to meet the increasingly diverse needs of veterans; just as, if Australia is to emerge from the recession as a country with a sound future for our young and the capacity to care properly for our aged, the Prime Minister is going to have to demonstrate a good deal more imagination and vision than was contained in the One Nation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us today will be passed by the Parliament. However, the path to prosperity for the people of Australia, including those who fought to protect our freedom, is to be found in the Fightback package, a package which will be fully implemented by the incoming coalition government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we really need to focus upon is the fact that the family, and particularly the one-income family, has shouldered an undue portion of the burden of this recession. What are the facts? Before I go into the detail of the Bill, let us take a look at the facts. I will enumerate 10 facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first one is that, for an average family, family allowances are worth only two-thirds of their original value. Mr Acting Deputy President, bear in mind the fact that when the family allowance was introduced in 1976 it was done with money which the Government saved from abolishing the tax rebate system. In other words, in most families, it was simply out of the hip pocket and into the purse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then, successive governments have been purloining, stealing, from the purses of Australian mothers. Currently, from the purse of a mother of four, the Government is stealing $50 per fortnight which was put in there in 1976 because of the abolition of the tax rebate scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fact two is that the weighted average minimum award rate of pay for full time adult employees has fallen in real terms by $60 per week in the last six years. Fact three is that two-thirds of those forced out of the paid labour force recently have been women, many of whom were there because of financial pressure on the family. Now, because of the recession, they are being forced out. My State alone has had a drop in the labour force of 8,100 people in the last three months; 5,300 of them have been women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fact four is that job creation has not helped people on unemployment benefits. These jobs have largely been taken up by others. Fact five is that changes in 1992 to parent contributions, school fees, university charges and book costs have all placed additional burdens on parents and students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fact six is that there are 5,000 fewer jobs for young people&mdash;15- to 19-year-olds&mdash;in Tasmania now than there were in January 1990. This is a drop of 25 per cent and is a further burden on the family. Fact seven is that the Government is no nearer to recognising the economic value of housework, which five years ago was calculated as being worth $150 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fact eight is that thousands of families have been forced to relinquish private health insurance because they cannot afford the premiums. In 1984, 54 per cent of Tasmanians were covered. Now the percentage is only 48 per cent. Fact nine is that the family allowance supplement is touted as a help to families, but only one in eight Tasmanian families who receive family allowances are eligible to receive this payment. Fact 10 is that the latest ABS figures show that since September 1991 the recession, as I indicated before, has put 8,100 people out of work, out of the labour force, 1,800 of them in the last month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the background to this Bill. If we are talking about social justice, should those facts not have been considered?  The Government is not talking about social justice; it is talking about kick-starting the economy. I am not criticising the Government for that; that is important. I agree with the Government that getting the money into the hands of families will mean money being expended. However, we should not lose sight of the issues of social justice and both vertical and horizontal equity in these areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This table shows that, were the Government to have allocated a one-off payment on the basis of social justice rather than necessarily kick-starting the economy, those with more children would not have been so unfairly treated. For example, under the provisions of this Bill the mother of two children will get $175 whereas, based on existing proportions, the payment should have been $250; for three children, instead of $200 the payment should have been $375; and for four children, instead of $225 the payment should have been $542, on the basis of existing proportions. If one is talking about justice and equity, one must remember that it is not the Government's money but somebody else's, on the basis of the tax rebate for children being abolished; that is, it is money belonging to the families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I say that the fight for the recognition of the rights of the Australian family must continue, until full economic and social justice is achieved and there has been an official recognition of the economic value of the work of the home-maker. We have seen that many of the mothers who have been forced into the paid work force have, because of the recession, been forced out of the paid work force. Where is the net to catch the problems there? Who is going to pay the bills? I accept, acknowledge and agree with the increase in the family allowance supplement. But, as I indicated, only one in eight Tasmanian families is eligible for that. And there are a whole range of families, particularly one-income families, who are finding the struggle almost impossible. That is an issue which must be faced up to by the Government and by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well to say that the majority of families now are not one-income families. That may or may not be the case at any given time. But at some time most families go through a period when they have to rely on one income. That is what we have to have a look at. That is of concern not only to those families but to every family now. It is of concern to my shop assistants union members. The older ones know that their sons and daughters will go through a period in which their families will have to rely on one income. The younger members of my union in the shops know that they at some stage, although they are now working, will have to go through a period when their family will have to rely on one income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been the percentage change in real disposable income for different types of families on certain taxable incomes? The differences have been quite significant.  Let</PARA>
<PARA>me talk about families on incomes of around $30,000. Honourable senators might think that families on incomes of around $30,000 should be able to cope reasonably well. But they are not coping, particularly if they are renting or have a mortgage repayment. And what has happened to those in real terms? I will give that information at some other stage. I have commissioned other research on this matter. But I will now show honourable senators what has happened in terms of the percentage change in real disposable income between 1982-83 and 1989-90 for different family types on a family taxable income of $30,000 per annum on one income and on two incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result for families on one income is on this graph which I have here. Look at it&mdash;it is down.

Is it not of concern to the Government that, when families go through a period when they have to be on one income, they will suffer a substantial decline in real disposable income? Is that fair? Is that equitable? Is it indeed sensible in the circumstances when there are more people in and seeking paid work than there are jobs available? That will always be the case. We can have all the rhetoric we like. The Government can say how many spare time jobs it has created. But it does not look at the number of full time jobs it has knocked off.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 is important because it at least recognises the plight of some millions in the community who are suffering as a result of the recession, and to the extent that we can do anything to alleviate the plight of families in particular, and those who are out of the work force in general, any action ought to be commended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not quite understand Senator Harradine's logic in saying that he will suspend judgment until after the Budget, because that Budget, as we know, is another six months away. We are talking about families being in severe financial difficulties right now, and we are being asked to pass judgment on a Bill which will reflect what the Government is doing for them over the next six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we know is that the Government in the area of family allowances is throwing $125 at most families. If that is not an election gimmick, I do not know what is. The timing is exquisite, being in the lead-up to the Wills by-election. It goes completely against what the Government is always talking about in the area of social security, namely targeting. What  shows the height of cynicism is that, when we look at the people who are most in need, as reflected by the demands placed on the voluntary agencies, we see that they are being given a derisory $2m to tide them over during this financial year. That is probably not much more than the cost of postage when this cold, heartless, callous Prime Minister starts sending off cheques in the lead-up to the by-election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put it in perspective, $317m is going in a one-off electoral bribe and $2m is going to the agencies which are by far best placed to target assistance to the families requiring it. There is simply nothing in this payment to indicate that it will be directed in any way towards demand stimulus, or paying off debts, or consumer spending. As Senator Lees said, it will probably go first towards paying off debts. However, if it is available to people with incomes of around $65,000 to $75,000&mdash;as it is; people with five children and an income of $74,000 are entitled to this payment of $250&mdash;what do they do with it? At that level they really do not need it. It does not make a great difference to someone on $74,000. Maybe they could buy another hub-cap for Paul's Mercedes, but other than that it is a purely token and unnecessary payment at that level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those people at the bottom end it could make a much greater difference but, again, it is not going to do much more than tide them over for a week or two. So it is utterly regressive, which of course goes against all the rhetoric of the Labor Party. It is a one-off gimmick which does not address the ongoing financial difficulties of something like 1.9 million families who currently receive family allowance, nor does it target those who are most in need&mdash;those who require emergency relief and various other forms of emergency assistance, as identified by the voluntary agencies. Instead, they get the ultimate in tokenism, not even enough, I would have thought, to tide them over for a week. That is really the calibre of this sort of bribe. I think it is little more than a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan and his cohorts are keen to talk about `a fistful of dollars'. Well, this is hardly a fingernail's worth but it is certainly in the same mould. To pretend in any way that this will do anything to alleviate any level of poverty is fanciful in the extreme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at what the Government has proposed in its `One Job', Paul's job, `Two Nations', rich and poor, statement, we find that something like half the taxpayers in this country will receive no benefit at all. Certainly, those who are on incomes of less than $20,700, which used to be what the Labor Party regarded as its traditional constituency, are getting nothing at all by way of tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What sort of explanation do we get from people like Senator Button and Senator Richardson? When we boil it all down the answer is, `Look, they got a pretty good run during the eighties and that's it'. Translated, that means,`They've had it too good for too long. There are no more votes there. Let's move on to the middle classes and see whether we can pick up a few there. We'll throw this sort of money&mdash;$250&mdash;at families with incomes of $74,000'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that that is obscene&mdash;to use a term much favoured by the former Prime Minister&mdash;because in no way does it try to alleviate the problems faced by low income earners. It basically ignores them. It is nothing more than a pitch at Wills in the short term and, in the longer term, at the majority of the voters, as the Government sees them,</PARA>
<PARA>the people being crushed by Labor's economic policies, the people who had never even contemplated unemployment&mdash;white collar workers&mdash;quite frequently now suddenly find themselves redundant and with virtually no future. They are the sort of people that Labor is desperate to get back into the game. As a result we get this totally untargeted and totally unjustified payment being made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said all that, I want to make it clear that we are certainly in the business of providing substantial and permanent increases in family allowances. That is why the Fightback package specifically provides a doubling of family allowance payments to families with incomes below $30,000 and, for those families with incomes between $30,000 and $40,000, a 50 per cent increase. Above that figure, the increase will be 6 per cent, which will be more than the inflationary impact of 4.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, in every respect we have targeted increases in family assistance to those people who most need them. On the other hand, the Labor Party has gone precisely in the opposite direction. I would hope that when members of the Labor Party are alone with their consciences and wonder what their Party philosophy is all about, they will at least have some second thoughts about how they ought to approach this in the next Budget and beyond and look at what market they are really into. The polls might tell us one thing, but I can assure honourable senators that even middle to high income earners expect some compassion from government and do recognise that the most vulnerable are those on low incomes. Those people will not comprehend why the Government is throwing its money around in this fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An amount of $317m, which could have been more effective if spent in almost any other way in the social security system, is instead simply going to be thrown up in the air in effect&mdash;the ultimate in non-targeting, the ultimate in transience. As a result, of course, this will be long forgotten beyond the by-election in Wills. But, no doubt, the Government hopes that it will have some sort of psychological effect there; that people getting a cheque in the mail in the lead-up to the by-election will somehow be grateful. Well, I do not think that they are so gullible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the $3 per week increase, again no-one would gainsay the proposition that people on low incomes are in need of assistance through the social security system. Of course, we could make it $3, $6 or $9 a week; it really would not matter. If the Government is not going to fund it, at the end of the day it has to come from somewhere, so there will be increased taxes paid by those people as well, no doubt, or there will be a blow-out in inflation or the Government will simply have to print money to cover the cost of it. On that basis, it is a Mickey Mouse arrangement. Unless these things are funded, it is really rather meaningless. So $3 is fine, but unless it comes from somewhere it is nothing more than a short term palliative; it does nothing about longer term assistance for those groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By and large, people do not want an extra couple of dollars a week. They want not just income security; they want job security, a stable economy and a low inflation rate. They do not want Mickey Mouse schemes that throw some money at people on an unfunded basis. I cannot possibly imagine anyone being other than utterly cynical about that sort of payment. Nonetheless, it is a Budget measure and no doubt the Government will try to claim some credit for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We take the view in regard to the abolition of rent assistance waiting periods that this involves much better targeting. In a sense, it is a nonsense to be making a payment to people after they have been out of the work force for six months. Indeed, people have said to me that they could not understand why they were on what used to be called unemployment benefits and then six months down the track suddenly found that the Government was paying them a bit more to be staying out of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, what the Government is trying to do is rationalise the system. However, to suggest that this will do much more than enable landlords to jack up the rent is, I think, overstating the virtue of the initiative. Once again, it does not do much for structural reform. It is really just another way of providing a backdoor increase in allowances and benefit rates from day one. Again, I am sure that if we asked people they would say that that was not the major problem. They want the economy fixed up. They want properly funded initiatives. They want the economy back on track. And they want jobs. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nature of the stimulus and the way it is being paid constitute an absolutely orthodox economic method of giving quick stimulus. There is no other way of so quickly providing economic stimulus than a direct payment to facilitate consumer expenditure. It is much better than tax cuts and much better targeted than tax cuts. The Opposition's obsession with tax cuts is to do with an entirely inappropriate priority. This way is much better targeted, much more effective and much quicker. The assistance goes to the people who need it most directly and it works very successfully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we have chosen to do it through family allowance and family allowance supplement is the reason that Senator Harradine referred to&mdash;that it is both a stimulus and a targeted stimulus. He was absolutely correct about that and that is what this does. It is a very straightforward thing. People can pore over it to find all sorts of complex motivations and get themselves in a lather&mdash;and I hope they do because it probably stops them from doing any more serious mischief&mdash;but it will not advance the course of public debate in Australia at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us just look at this objectively within the broad parameters of the One Nation package. This is a very simple, straightforward economic stimulus of a very orthodox economic nature which is targeted very successfully to people in need. There is some view that people will use it to just pay off their debts. I have to say that that is not a crisis. It will reduce but not remove the element of stimulus within it. When we see the vox populi on television and families being asked what they are going to do with this, they have not been saying, `We are going to use it to pay off the debt'. They have been making very sensible statements about things which they will do with it to assist themselves, to assist their families and children. That is a wise thing for them to do and it is what they are most likely to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I might refer to something of a diversion from Senator Lees, it is also why it is unlikely to flow into imports. Of course, any expenditure has a propensity in some part to flow into imports. That is inevitable. But the sorts of expenditures that are likely by people who are getting the money are much less likely to flow into imports than are many other sorts of stimuli&mdash;including,  I  might say, tax cuts. Even if the money goes to pay off debts, it changes the capacity of those people subsequently to enter into other commitments. The money, when it goes to pay off debts, does not disappear. It stays in the economy as a stimulus applying a little more indirectly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the motivation, one sees that it is primarily a quick stimulus which will, by all the conventional economic analysis, create some several thousand jobs. It is targeted directly so that the money goes to those in need, as everybody has agreed it should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There are other worthwhile initiatives: the continuing increase in the family allowance supplement and the change to the rent allowance. There has been no Opposition criticism of those proposals. I welcome their support. </PARA>

However, it is misrepresentation for the Opposition to say that these expenditures compensate people for the GST and then at the same time laud itself for giving people increases. If it is compensating people for the GST, it is not making them better off; it is simply changing the nature of the cash flow in people's family budgets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a little controversy, with people getting a bit agitated, because I said that under the GST the price of food will go up by 8 per cent. The Treasury analysis, which Opposition senators have quoted when it has suited them during this debate&mdash;Senator Newman is entitled to do so; she picked those parts of the Treasury analysis with which she agreed and quoted them&mdash;makes it quite clear that under the GST package the price of food will go up by 8.9 per cent: fruit and vegetables by 10.1 per cent; clothing by 11.2 per cent; other necessities such as electricity by 10.7 per cent; and post and telephone by 8.1 per cent. </PARA>

Senator Harradine used a slightly different emphasis than I would, but nevertheless he was correct. He said that what we are spending is not the Government's money. Every dollar we spend is, in one sense, taxpayers' money. We should spend it in the knowledge that we are the trustees of other people's money, rather than thinking of ourselves as a source of generosity, giving away our own money to people who may well deserve to receive it. I think the taxpayers of Australia would agree that that is an appropriate way to be doing it. But it is important to put on the record from time to time that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people think we are mugs enough to believe that we are going to get a great rash of electoral support for these expenditures, they underestimate us and they underestimate the Australian voters. The Australian electors will support these measures to the extent that they think it is a sensible thing to do and that they are good policy. I think they will support them. But to say that people are going to flock in droves to change their vote because their bank account gets a direct injection is an extraordinary proposition; it is a measure which has never worked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987 the Opposition tried it with an extraordinary set of tax cuts that were funded by a very unfair set of expenditure cuts. The voters, quite understandably, rejected it. The opinion polls made it clear that the voters said, `Yes, I understand that I would be better off under this proposal, but the country will be worse off'. They voted against it, and they were absolutely right to do so. They will do the same with regard to Fightback as the year advances and the choice is made between the options that are before the Australian people. I remain optimistic about the choice they will make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the debate on this Bill and the support for the measures within it. I reject some of the motives attributed to the Government, but let us not quibble about that. I am pleased that people are supporting the legislation.

<PARA>I also have great problems with Senator Alston's amendment. I worry sometimes when I agree with Senator Alston on issues, but I also have great problems with the targeting of this legislation. I think we really do have to look very carefully at the motives behind it. For example, if there were $300m going, we could have looked at more than the welfare agencies, which, in many cases, are not able to give relief on anything more frequent than a three-monthly basis. They turn people away and those people have to wait three months before they can get any further assistance even if it is only a food voucher that they are seeking. If the money were not going to the welfare agencies, it could go to the rural sector, to single parents or to a number of other areas that I mentioned in my speech. Therefore, if we take out any reference to the Fightback proposal, which I also have considerable reservations about, the Australian Democrats will be supporting the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1991. This is an omnibus Bill covering, once again, a wide range of taxation measures, some highly technical and, consequently, quite complicated. Before I go into that, the March 1991 statement, especially the depreciation provisions, was designed&mdash;over 12 months ago now&mdash;to kick start the economy. Unfortunately, because of the problems in framing legislation, procrastination and delays, we are only today seeing the legislation to cover some of the outstanding issues of the March 1991 statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result has been that many corporations have actually delayed, rather than brought forward, their investment programs. I remind the Senate that there will be a further delay as a result of the further changes to depreciation announced in the One Nation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, measures which were designed to kick-start the economy will not have the effect that was intended because there is going to be no legislative base. Mr Deputy President, you will recall that this morning I put before this chamber a notice of motion calling on the Government to bring forward its legislative program, particularly in relation to depreciation, in order that companies can have some certainty and encouragement to bring forward, rather than delay, their investment programs. Unfortunately, the changes are just seen as another delaying technique. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us at the moment has been introduced to plug loopholes, to correct anomalies and to address a number of outstanding issues. In doing so it has created a number of new flaws and new problems. This has added a great deal of confusion for the taxation profession and to companies seeking investment. It will be necessary to introduce new amendments to cover the depreciation changes announced only last week in the 1992 Federal economic statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is incumbent upon the Government to introduce speedily legislation which will, for example, remove the delay as to the future of the 20 per cent loading that has been enshrined in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1991. With all the changes announced in the One Nation package, the coalition is concerned that there will also be a resultant legislative bottleneck later on in this session and we can only hope that there will be appropriate time allowed for discussing, in this chamber, some of the difficult provisions that arise from the February One Nation statement and that will have to be brought before the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us today does not cover the 1992 economic statement. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1991 is dealing with measures announced largely in the March 1991 economic statement, by earlier press releases and by some unannounced items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill contains over 16 significant amendments which include changes to depreciation allowances, anti-avoidance provisions relating to deduction recoupment, balancing adjustment, partnership roll-over relief under the capital gains tax, dividend rebate and deferral of deductions from prepayments of trading stock, as well as changes to the tax file number system. There are also changes in the taxation of foreign source income and substantiation discretion in relation to the fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The depreciation amendment figures most significantly. For a year now industry has been writing submissions and complaining about the constant watering down of what was originally announced last year. Today, we still have before us what I call an interim result. Why? Because the Government will be making further changes to the depreciation regime following this February economic statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a government to bring to fruition legislation announced 12 months ago and then announce changes again is a tragedy. Some time ago the Australian Taxation Office developed the slogan&mdash;and I complimented the Office on it&mdash;`A service orientated office'. Again, it is unfortunate that this Government, which administers the Australian Taxation Office, does not show the same commitment to its taxpayers or to its constituents as does the Australian Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why? We have had questions on taxation issues on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> for up to five months and they are still outstanding. In an environment of self-assessment which demands a regime of certainty, the Australian Government is simply taking the Australian taxpayers far too cheaply. Already most parliamentarians' phones and fax machines have been running hot with requests from accountants for knowledge about the starting dates and the implications of the new depreciation arrangements, particularly in relation to the effect these arrangements will have on the Bill now before us. There is confusion and uncertainty. This seems to be the outcome of most things the Government touches, especially in the taxation field at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us and the expected legislation make a mockery of this Government's comment in last year's statement when Prime Minister Hawke said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have radically overhauled depreciation provisions to bring them more in line with business realities.</PARA>
<PARA>It certainly attempted to do that then and has again because it did not get them right. Mr Keating continued in the same vein, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These reforms will have many positive benefits as they provide taxpayers more discretion, greater certainty, and enhanced simplicity.</PARA>
<PARA>People should have a look at the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1991 and see whether it brings about more simplicity. The industry does not have simplicity, certainty and more discretion. In the present economic situation and the announcement once again of the country's imports rising and exports declining in this month's balance of payments figures, businesses are looking towards the Government for incentives to encourage Australia's export performance. We are getting these things on paper and in press releases but we are not getting them into legislation sufficiently quickly to give businesses the certainty to go ahead with these so-called programs. This is because the statements are phrased in such a way as to lack clarity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian companies, therefore, are choosing not to enter the export markets. Why? Because Australia's inhibiting tax laws are destroying investment potential. The changes announced last month to depreciation regimes were intended to boost exports. This week's current account figures certainly do not testify to the achievement of that grand objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 24 January, Martin Soutter from the Business Council of Australia described Australia as having basically a repair and maintenance-type economy, whereas dynamic economies are those constantly replacing capital stock with state of the art equipment. He states that part of the reason we have done as we have done is the way our tax law works. This Government did start with some change to the depreciation regime last year, but unfortunately it could not get it right. Therefore, I now wish to examine the technical aspects of the Bill and point briefly to the areas which need re-examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend to use the committee stage of this Bill later this month for a deeper and more meaningful explanation of the technical aspects. I think it is unfortunate that we have this Bill before us without any amendments. I believe that amendments could be introduced at the committee stage and I look forward to them. If the Government cannot produce the amendments to cover a number of deficiencies, the Opposition certainly will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed meaning of `effective life' leads the list. Last March, the new definition of effective life under a system of self-assessment was introduced. By September, the newspaper headlines were crying, `No significant changes to depreciation rate'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present arrangements, as outlined in this Bill, will only add uncertainty to a taxpayer's calculation of effective life. Every taxpayer will be expected to determine effective life objectively by reference to the use of the item of plant and equipment, not only by himself, but also by future owners. The limiting aspect of the definition is the property's use for income producing purposes by any person&mdash;a great qualification which is put on the initial person who acquires that plant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus, the life of second-hand plant restricts the value of the amendment to the first purchaser of the plant. This is regardless of the fact that, on a subjective test, the item may no longer by utilised by a particular taxpayer. The concept of economic obsolescence is not recognised in the proposed definition of effective life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore urge the Government to consider a more appropriate definition, such as a reference to the estimated life of a item of plant or equipment which it will have in the ordinary course of the proposed income producing activities, taking into account such factors as expected circumstances of use of the item by the taxpayer, whether the expected life of the item is restricted by the duration of a particular project in which it is to be used, and predictable obsolescence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A definition along these lines will permit a taxpayer, electing to make a determination as to effective life, to write off in whole the cost of the plant over the period ascertained. For example, a taxpayer permitted to depreciate an item over a five-year period under the existing depreciation rates might determine that the effective life of the plant in his or her own circumstances is perhaps four years. A taxpayer under such a system would not be required to have regard to the possibility that the item might have some alternative income producing capacity beyond the period that the taxpayer regarded as unproductive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the taxpayer sought to write off an item at a faster rate than could be justified, not only at the time of acquisition but also some years later when the auditors come in&mdash;the effective life could subsequently change due to changes in technology or as a result of changes in demand&mdash;an audit adjustment would be made rendering the taxpayer liable to a penalty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Problems also occur with the transitional rules dealing with the introduction of effective life rates of depreciation as they are unnecessarily complex, especially for companies with substituted accounting periods. Companies with substituted accounting periods have simply put off their investment programs because of the uncertainty and complication. The effective life rates apply to property acquired after 1 March but not applicable until 1 July 1991. A company with a substituted accounting period is not able to use the broadbanded depreciation rates until the start of its 1991-92 year of income. Clearly, the record keeping requirements in such a case are overly onerous for a change in the law that was designed to simplify the depreciation regime. They are counterproductive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, problems occur with the new pooling arrangements. Proposed new section 62AAC requires a taxpayer to give a written notice of the creation of a depreciation pool within six months of the end of the year of income. This six-month period is at odds with the general requirement that corporate income tax returns must be lodged within 8 1/2 months of the end of the year of income. There is no reason why the written notice is required any earlier, especially as it appears that, under self-assessment, there is not a requirement to lodge it with the Commissioner of Taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Depreciation of plant which is acquired part way through the year cannot be pooled. Depreciation must be calculated not by the straight line method but by using the diminishing value method. It appears that the new <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> statement will make it mandatory for depreciation to be calculated on a reducing balance method. That is not convenient for a lot of companies with fairly regular and not complex investment programs which might be suited to the straight line depreciation method. These companies will have to switch over and change their computer systems just to suit this particular whim of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With these pooling arrangements, the plant may then be allocated to the relevant pool in the following year. This aspect is unnecessarily cumbersome and requires virtually all plant&mdash;other than that which happens to be bought on the first day of the year of income&mdash;to be depreciated in the normal way before it can be depreciated under the pooling approach. One is losing many of the benefits in the initial year of the pool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This requirement appears to be at odds with the stated objective of pooling, as outlined in proposed section 62AAB, which is to provide a simplified method of depreciation. It is not simplified; it is complicated. I would suggest that an alternative might be to allow half of the normal depreciation rate as a deduction in the first year in which items are brought into the pool. That would solve the problem. I ask the Minister:  what effect will the 20 per cent loading enshrined in this Bill have when we have this new rate? I understand that it is going to be substantially changed for part of the tax scales. This will only add confusion to confusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem which has surfaced is that industry feels confused as to whether it should use the Australian Taxation Office depreciation schedules. Clause 16 repeals section 55 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which currently sets out the basis of depreciation, including how effective life is to be calculated with, in particular, a recognition of the fact that the Commissioner is currently authorised under that section to determine the effective life of units of property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is presently evidenced by income tax order 1217, which sets out a schedule of depreciation rates for various items of property. Because of the repeal of this section, technically a taxpayer has no authority to rely on any rates that may be set by the Commissioner in an ancillary document such as ITO 1217. Consequently, regardless of what is said in the explanatory memorandum, a taxpayer may in fact be open to penalties under the law for adopting such a rate&mdash;how ridiculous&mdash;in the absence of any evidence to support effective life being adopted, because proposed subsection 54A(1), does not contain any words authorising the taxpayer to adopt the rates set out by the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Senator Tate that I trust that the Government will introduce amending legislation to correct this dreadful unintended consequence, and I look forward to seeing the amendment at the committee stage&mdash;I understand it is not ready yet. It is incumbent on the Government to introduce that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus, a taxpayer who used the Tax Office depreciation schedules because they gave a more favourable result will be relying on the goodwill of the Office not to challenge it at a later date. We cannot have such a situation in tax law. Consequently, there should be imported into section 54A (a) a specific reference allowing the taxpayer to adopt, as an alternative, any estimate of effective life set by the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I stated at the outset of this speech, the legislation before us has been produced to overcome anomalies in the present taxation Act. However, in doing so, more problems have been created. This is especially so with the legislation that has been designed to clarify a major area of uncertainty in corporate tax laws. The terms of the proposed section 45Z in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) throw into doubt the availability of rebates of tax under section 46 in respect of dividends received through unit trusts by unit-holders which are resident companies. Proposed section 45Z applies only where the beneficiary is `absolutely entitled' to the relevant shares, and therefore may deny a rebate where the dividends are received through discretionary or unit trusts. That is an impossible situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the proposed section is not amended to secure the dividend rebate to corporate unit-holders, multiple taxation of company profits distributed as dividends will be imposed on this class of investors. Consequently, existing corporate unit-holders may need to sell their units, and prospective corporate unit-holders will not in future invest in the unit trusts which acquire equities. The coalition urges the Government to take immediate steps to expand proposed section 45Z to make it clear that corporate unit-holders in a trust are entitled to a section 46 rebate to the extent that distributions represent dividends received by the unit trust from exempt companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a longstanding practice for the Tax Office not to deny the dividend rebate claimed by corporate unit-holders in respect of the dividend component of unit trust distributions received from public investment trusts. I refer the chamber to past issued rulings of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation which confirm the granting of the section 46 rebate to corporate unit-holders in large `public' unit trusts which carry on investment activities and are division 6 trusts; hence the anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To penalise such unit trust investors when compared to shareholders in investment companies is to discriminate against unit trusts, which are a long established and important sector of the economy for the collection of private savings for investment. Such treatment offends against the basic tenet of neutrality in a fair and efficient taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to note that one correspondent to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on this topic expressed that he was pleased that the Government was finally giving statutory legitimisation so that the corporate rebate on dividends is now available to beneficial owners of shares registered in the names of nominees. The law is to be changed retrospectively to 17 August 1976, the date of the High Court's decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, it effectively removes any personal liability on the officers of the Tax Office for not technically enforcing the law for the last 25 years. I ask Senator Tate what sort of legislation that is. Treating taxpayers equally and protecting officers of the Tax Office who apply commercially sensible practice should be axiomatic in any system. But the question arises as to why it was thought necessary in the Bill to exclude from the benefit of this retrospective legitimisation those few taxpayers to whom the Tax Office had not applied the practice. Why should they be discriminated against? I mention one name which I think is relevant. Why was Adelaide Steamship selected while everybody else was let off the hook? With this legislation we retrospectively let everybody else off the hook. This discrimination is just intolerable in any system, and I note that Senator Tate is nodding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the amendment for anti-avoidance deduction recoupment&mdash;that is, for roll-over relief&mdash;the measures in this Bill effectively force companies that want to transfer assets within a corporate group to adopt market value where those assets are subject to deduction recoupment provisions. There appears to be an overemphasis on the claim that the amendments are required to deal with tax avoidance arising out of these provisions. That is just a nonsense. In effect, with the advent of capital gains tax&mdash;save in respect of motor vehicles, pre-CGT assets and assets which may not constitute separate assets, under section 160P, for the purpose of capital gains tax&mdash;many of the opportunities no longer exist. There may still be some deferral advantage available. In these circumstances, to justify the amendment solely on the basis of anti-avoidance measures must be questioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The combined effect of these measures is to add considerable further complexity to corporate group reorganisations where there appears to be little scope for avoidance. For example, for the vast majority of items of depreciable plant, the market value is not significantly different from the tax written down value. For administrative convenience, assets have normally been treated intra-group at book or tax written down values. This practice has had wide acceptance. In situations where the market value of assets may be greater than their written down value, companies will now be called upon to undertake a separate review to determine the tax impact, or ensure that capital gains roll-over tax is elected, if available. This is just a nonsense&mdash;and extra work for corporations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For taxpayers with high volumes of depreciable plant the vast majority of which would not generate a CGT gain or loss, this is an unwarranted additional burden in record keeping. For taxpayers in groups with less than 100 per cent common ownership because of, say, preference share financing, CGT roll-over is not available. These companies cannot avoid the effects of the deemed market value disposal. The tax impact of this measure to the group can be deferred where capital gains tax roll-over relief is utilised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the balancing adjustment roll-over relief amendment is examined, the coalition fears that there will be situations where it may be difficult for the transferee to obtain full details from the transferor of depreciation previously claimed on an item of plant and equipment acquired by the transferee. That is a practical, everyday problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment highlights the problems that arise when we have a government that insists on legislating by press release. Taxation and business commentators have warned time and time again that the practice is fraught with danger, as so often happens when legislation does not use the words of the press release or the press release is ambiguous. In this case we have a press release proclaiming balancing adjustment roll-over relief of which the tax profession was generally unaware. The explanatory memorandum advises that the measure was announced on 8 December 1990. But on investigation we find this did not occur. Apparently the press release involved, No. 119, was withheld from circulation on the planned 6 December issue as a mark of respect for the sudden death of Chris Higgins, Secretary to the Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 8 March another unnumbered release was announced. The press release in question was also not distributed by the Australian Taxation Office as a result. Fortunately, unless taxpayers have decided not to roll-over because of recoupment of depreciation issues, et cetera, they have not been seriously disadvantaged. They have six months from royal assent to make an election and request an amended assessment. At another time the consequences could have been worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to point out some of the  technical problems, which I shall also raise during the committee stage, associated with several other amendments within this Bill. I am pleased to see that the Commissioner is being granted a discretion when applying the substantiation rules in the fringe benefits tax legislation. This is a further extension of my private member's Bill several years ago, which was subsequently adopted by the Government. At the time it only moved so far as income tax was concerned, although the second leg did relate to the fringe benefits tax. We have had to wait all that time for the discretion that has now been built into the fringe benefits tax regime through this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, I still have some queries with this discretion. The requirement of proposed section 123B(1)(a) is that the Commissioner be satisfied that `a benefit has been provided in, or in respect of, a year of tax in respect of the employment of an employee of an employer'. It is difficult to understand why the Commissioner needs to reach a state of satisfaction as to the provision of a benefit. If no benefit has been provided there will be no need to consider the application of the substantiation rules and therefore no need to ameliorate their impact. That is quite obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Declarations are a significant operational aspect of the fringe benefits tax legislation and have the effect of reducing the taxable value or giving effect to an exemption. They are substantiable materials in another guise. The amelioration provided by the provisions before us should extend to declarations. I am concerned that the full substantiation relief granted by section 82KZAA(1)(c) in the Income Tax Assessment Act is also conveyed in proposed section 123B of the fringe benefits tax legislation. I shall examine this more closely during the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the amendment dealing with the deferral of deductions for trading stock purchases involving prepayments, the most obvious defect in that provision is that, if the goods never come on hand because they are dealt with by the purchaser between the time of ordering them and the time of their delivery when they would ordinarily constitute trading stock, no deduction would be allowed under section 51(1), as it is currently drafted, therefore denying a legitimate deduction. This is another travesty of justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased, however, to see that the Government has allowed for a maximum deduction of up to 150 per cent of expenditure for qualifying plant claimed over three years in three equal instalments if that plant is first used prior to 30 June 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to division 10AB, which was introduced by Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 and which allows a deduction for certain costs incurred in rehabilitative mining, quarrying and petroleum sites, the Bill before us aims to clarify the operation of the division. However, it fails to address one critical aspect, which is the meaning of the word `site'. Considerable uncertainty exists within the mining industry as to what expenditure is covered by the division when site rehabilitation is undertaken. Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) presents the perfect opportunity to rectify the situation, and I hope that we will see an amendment clarifying this definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, as time is fast going I will just mention a few other points of concern: the foreign exchange gains and losses provisions, the capital gains tax roll-over relief for partnerships, the taxation of foreign source income and the tax file numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall the coalition supports the thrust of the Bill but it condemns the number of flaws contained in it and deplores the time that it has taken to bring this legislation into effect. We also condemn the Government for its inability to legislate with certainty and clarity on the depreciation issue. We urge the Government to introduce amendments to clarify the confusion that exists where there is a chain of ownership between companies in a corporate group, and to take into consideration all the other matters that I have addressed during the few minutes that have been made available to me. I look forward to further debate during the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, we are today finally debating Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4). As Senator Watson pointed out, it is probably the longest standing Bill on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. Certainly, we are debating it very belatedly. Although it is still only an interim Bill, it is the first Bill I know of that is likely to be out of date before it has been debated. Although the measures contained in this Bill were announced in the 12 March statement of last year, they have been overshadowed by the One Nation package of February of this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose things have gone so far down the track&mdash;and Senator Tate will probably agree&mdash;that we could just about call it retrospective legislation. The effects of the Bill will not be around for very long because further legislation will be introduced eventually. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aspect of the Bill worst affected by the delay&mdash;Senator Watson mentioned this briefly&mdash;is the one relating to the purchase of plant. In the 12 March statement we were given the idea that there would be far more use of accelerated depreciation of the effective life. People contemplating the purchase of mining machinery&mdash;the mining industry is the one with the most to gain from this Bill&mdash;were all wondering when this was coming into effect, because the 12 March statement put no starting date on it&mdash;although I stand to be corrected on that. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, watering down. What happened then was that the people who wanted to buy big gear&mdash;in mining people do not buy an item of plant, even a very small one, for much under half a million dollars; it is mostly around the $700,000 to $1m mark per item&mdash;could see that there was going to be a change, because there was a bit of talk going around before the announcement of 12 March, and they just stopped buying and waited to see what the rules were going to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then 1 July arrived but still nothing had been done. Senator Watson and I were screaming in this place asking when the legislation would be introduced. But the Bill did not arrive. Between 12 March and July and beyond there was pressure from the earthmoving industry and the people who sell the gear to make the new definition effective from 12 March. The Government agreed to it. I do not know when the Government agreed to do that. I never saw it in writing.I only found out about it when I got the memorandum. Let us say, for example, that the Government agreed to that in October&mdash;I certainly do not know when it happened&mdash;then there would have been a resultant 12 months loss of production due to new machines sitting in yards at, for example, South Guildford in Western Australia, where the Caterpillar gear is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That equipment was sitting doing nothing when it could have been out in mines generating wealth for Australia and replacing older machines. The machinery distributors were left in the lurch. They had servicemen and salesmen doing nothing but waiting for the Government to make up its mind about the legislation. Of course, the gear bought after 12 March 1991 will now have these measures applied to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then get back to the other story: one set of rules applying from 12 March 1991 to 30 June 1991 and another set of rules applying from now on. Equipment will be written off under two different systems. Who wins out of this? I believe that the only winners are the accounting firms. The present Government, with its amendments to taxation legislation&mdash;we have about four changes a year&mdash;has created more work for the accountants and more work and costs for people using the accountants. The situation is heavily in favour of accountants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the finer points of the Bill. I would firstly like to address the depreciation provisions in the Bill. They can briefly be described as the re-definition of `effective life'&mdash;which Senator Watson has already spoken about&mdash;and the broadbanding and pooling of equipment. `Effective life' means the time over which an item of equipment can reasonably be expected to be used for income generating purposes by any person. My experience in regard to buying equipment&mdash;especially equipment with motors&mdash;is that such equipment can be expected to have an effective life of five years. It is written off in a straight line over five years. Although I suppose that, really, with diminishing value it would be written off in about four and a half years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have proposed a change in the meaning of `effective life'. Senator Watson said that we have to have regard to the use to which equipment will be put after the first owner has disposed of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It's a nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an utter nonsense. How can we really tell what condition a machine will be in at the end of that time? How can we tell what sort of use that machine will be put to after it is sold? After the initial five years use of the machine it could be sold, for example, to a contractor who will really work it 24 hours a day and thus get only 12 months use out of it or it could be used on a farm&mdash;say it is a front end loader&mdash;where it will last another 15 years. Who can tell? It is an utter nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that depreciation measures will be far worse as a result of this Bill than they have been before. We need to look at total effective life. I can see no real incentive in this Bill for industry, whether the earthmoving industry, the farming industry or the mining industry, to spend more on new equipment to increase production. There may be incentives by way of an upturn in the economy&mdash;if that is ever going to happen under this Government&mdash;or an upturn in iron ore or gold prices or an upturn in rural production to encourage people to reinvest in equipment. But I can see no reason why business should invest in new machinery more quickly than they had expected because of the measures in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the measures we are debating now, which came out of the 12 March statement, new measures have been introduced to try to improve on the package. As I said at the beginning of my speech, there are no incentives in the One Nation package. Investment allowances are narrowed, and we will debate that. It has only taken the Government from last March to February to work out that the` effective life' provisions and new depreciation schedules were hopeless. The package we are dealing with now went through the House of Representatives only 24 hours before the new package was announced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry is concerned about the Government's effective life provisions. Who is going to work out what the effective life of a machine is when they have to look at what someone else down the track may be doing? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>What one really has to do, I believe, is look at the economic life of the machine. One works a machine for so long until one can see that it is not producing enough and so on. One must look at how it can be improved, technologically or otherwise, not at what it may or may not do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Broadbanding has been covered very well by Senator Watson so I will not go into it in detail. The idea is to reduce the number of scales by which one can depreciate to seven: 33 1/3, 20, 15, 10, 7 1/2, 5 and 2 1/2. Anything over 33 per cent is written off in one year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides that anything up to $300 can be fully deducted in the first year. In the earthmoving game, one starts off at about $500,000 for the first item, and then one goes to the other end of the scale where one can write off immediately in one year anything up to $300. I think this is a nonsense. Having had experience in the game of depreciation and those sorts of things in business, I believe&mdash;to throw a figure into the air&mdash;that anything under $2,000 should be written off immediately rather than setting up a schedule with accounting fees that will go on it. It costs just as much to set up a depreciation schedule for $301 as it does for $33,000 or $300,000. So I believe that the figure of $300 is ridiculously low. It only causes book work for nothing. I believe that a starting figure should be at least $2,000, if not more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to something that this Government is very fazed about, that causes it to jump at every shadow. It has to dangle it in front of everyone to pick up the few idle votes around that it may still be getting. I refer to the anti-avoidance measures. The Minister's second reading speech states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In some instances, the existing law allows taxpayers to nominate as the selling price of an asset the lesser of its market value and its tax written down value. This rule can result in tax avoidance where an asset with a high market value and a low written down value is disposed of by a taxpayer to a related entity at the lower value. If the related entity then sells the property at its true market value, the proceeds cannot be treated as a recoupment of the previous owner's deductions.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Button, in reply to a question, made quite a bit of noise about this last year. However, the Minister in his second reading speech left out a very important aspect; that is, that anyone doing that would have been picked up by the capital gains tax provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I can briefly indicate how this comes about: a machine or an item of plant is written off completely over five years, and on the books it is worth $10 or $100. If that machine or item of plant is sold for $2,000, the difference between those amounts is a profit because the owner has to allow for what he has recouped through his taxation deduction. Of course, that has to be accounted for. The explanatory memorandum shows us how the Government has gone overboard:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .the plant depreciation provisions require a reconciliation to be made between the consideration for a disposal of depreciated property with its depreciated value (ie. the cost of the property less the amount of deductions allowed).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.4. Any excess of the consideration for disposal over depreciated value&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is what the Minister had to say about depreciation recoupment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is assessable to the extent of deductions allowed to the taxpayer disposing of the property. (Any consideration for disposal which is in excess of the cost of the property will fall for consideration under the capital gains tax provisions).</PARA>
<PARA>It is here in the explanatory memorandum for the Government to read. Yet in his second reading speech the Minister very conveniently left it out. I suppose that, for political purposes, if people think there is wholesale taxation evasion around Australia, it sounds good. However, the explanatory memorandum says that it does fall under the capital gains tax provision. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.5. S<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>imilarly, if the consideration for disposal is less than depreciated value, the deficiency is deductible.</PARA>
<PARA>If one loses on it, then it is deductible. It is plain to everyone. Further, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.6. To prevent tax avoidance where property is transferred at less than true value between persons who are not dealing with each other at arm's length, some of the capital allowance provisions required balancing adjustments calculated as if the disposal was at market value. However, others (most notably, plant depreciation allowances) treat such non-arm's length disposals as made for consideration equal to the lesser of market value or depreciated value.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.7. This has resulted in tax avoidance. For example, an asset that has a low depreciated value, but a substantial market value, might be sold for its depreciated value by the original owner to a related entity&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is what Senator Button said&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">eg. a company of which the original owner is the principal shareholder. That transaction would not result in any recoupment of the vendor's depreciation. The related company could then sell the asset for its true market value without being taxed on recoupment of depreciation allowed to the original owner.</PARA>
<PARA>The explanatory memorandum is confusing. Under that last paragraph, section 25A of the Income Tax Act would pick it up and it would then go through as a capital gain. Is any taxpayer going to deliberately put himself onto capital gains tax rather than normal income tax? I just cannot see any reason for it; perhaps Senator Tate can tell me. I believe there would be very minimal advantage in doing that because under capital gains the rate is not taken to be the top tax rate, it is taken to be the taxpayer's rate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>For capital gains tax his income is increased by 25 per cent to get a tax value that the Tax Office can charge him and it applies that over the whole lot. Having done an exercise on it, I can say that it works out to make very little difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just cannot see why the Government and the Tax Office are getting so fazed about avoidance that they include paragraphs in the explanatory memorandum that contradict each other. I would like an explanation from the Minister as to why it is being done. As I have said, I cannot see anyone deliberately going into capital gains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I turn now to deductibility for the rehabilitation of mine sites. As Senator Watson has already pointed out, there is an amendment in this Bill to clarify the position.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been recently drawn to my attention that the Department of Defence has circulated a defence economic brief to the senior hierarchy of the Department which I understand numbers about 60 people. I intend to read some of what it says onto the public record. It is a very short item&mdash;it is short but not sweet. The heading is `Goods and Services Tax (GST)'. The body of the message, as it comes from the Department of Defence, is this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The GST as proposed in the Coalition's "Fightback" package would be levied at 15% and charged on the supply of goods and services in Australia and on the importation of goods into Australia. In essence it is a value added tax where the full brunt of the tax falls on the final consumer of goods and services. The possible impact on Defence could be considerable. If exemptions were not provided, the impact on Defence, based on 1990-91 outlay could be of the order of $740m.</PARA>
<PARA>That went out to the senior hierarchy of the Department of Defence with a covering note dated 19 February, 1992. First of all, the material in that brief is quite untrue and it shows that the Fightback package has not been read by the officials who compiled that brief, or it suggests that they are prepared to misrepresent the true state of affairs. I am concerned that there may be an element of misrepresentation in this because the Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, came into this chamber on 11 December last and made a similar allegation. There and then, my colleague the shadow Minister for Finance, Senator Short, jumped up in this place. I now wish to read some of what he said. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer Senator Ray to pages 15 and 16 of supplementary paper No.5 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>. If he or some of his acolytes had taken the time to read this document; if he had used some of the resources of the Public Service, which were at his unlimited disposal at taxpayers' expense to try to knock holes in this thing; and if they had half a brain and had read the technical manual on the GST, they would have read section 5.4.3 which deals with supplies by public sector bodies. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The public sector is taxable if the goods or services are provided in the course of commercial activity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Goods and services are zero rated&mdash;'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That means that they pay no GST on their input and no GST on their output&mdash;`if they comprise a regulatory activity or are non-commercial in nature, for example'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It lists a number of examples. The last example is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`governmental services like defence, law and order'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer Senator Ray to page 16 of supplementary paper No.5 of the Fightback package. I hope that he will have the courtesy and the decency to come back into this chamber at some stage, admit that he set up the greatest straw man of all time and apologise to everyone who heard him make that absolute furphy.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Ray did not come back to this chamber and make such an apology. I am disappointed that when the inaccuracy of his claim was pointed out to him he did not do so. I would have expected him to have the grace to acknowledge how wrong he was. I would have expected at least that his Department would be reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to see what its Minister had been saying and anything that was said back to its Minister. I understand that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> is circulated to the top echelons of the Department. I would expect them to read it; it costs them money, I think. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> was not read? Why is it that the Fightback package was not read?

I find it completely unsatisfactory that on 19 February, some two months after the Fightback package came out, the financial section of the Department of Defence should be sending this claim, which is so wrong and so misleading, to about 60 senior personnel in the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When are we going to get that apology from the Minister? It is long overdue.

We can surely expect to have honesty in government. Certainly, the taxpayers expect that their funds are not spent on misinformation campaigns on such a serious matter which affects the future good governing of this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1991 the Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures had before it a number of witnesses. One of those witnesses was a Mr Sherry who made false accusations against members of the ETU in Queensland and against the union generally. This view was taken up by Senator Walters when she maligned two officials of the ETU during a session of this Parliament. I believe that those people's explanation and point of view should be not only heard in this chamber but also read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I quote a letter from Mr Robert Henricks, who is the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>Secretary of the Queensland branch of the ETU, to Dr Laing, who was the Secretary of the Select Committee. The letter said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I acknowledge your letter of November 19, 1991. I thank you for the opportunity to respond to allegations made against me by Mr Sherry. I apologise for the delay in replying. However, I was absent overseas until after your committee completed its hearings of evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Sherry alleges that I threatened him on two occasions with physical harm and that he was so alarmed by my threat he was prepared to commit an offence under the Telecommunications Act. He went so far as to suggest that he was "scared for my life". This demonstrates the lack of credibility which any fair minded person would find in his evidence. I never at any time told Mr Sherry that I would "fix him". Nor did I threaten his life. Nor did I intend that he should have any such perception. Nor do I believe that he had any such perception.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I recall a heated discussion with Mr Sherry when, after believing he was a genuine supporter of the Sacked SEQEB Workers, it was brought to my attention that his intentions and reasons for carrying out the research he was performing were not honourable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to his accusations of money collected to support Sacked SEQEB Workers being used to financially support political candidates, which some people have interpreted to infer that some of the money in the so called "ETU Fund" was used for such a purpose, I can confirm after discussing this matter with Sacked Workers who were involved in managing and running that fund (which was not controlled by the ETU but by the Sacked Workers themselves), that to the best of my knowledge absolutely none of that fund was used to support any candidate or any political office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am very conscious of the importance of my position. I am proud of that position with the ETU and of my achievements as a member of the Executive. I certainly made it clear to Mr Sherry that I would be most upset if he used information he had obtained from me to malign that Union or its members. There may have been some words said in heat but in fact I was consciously restrained, as far as I was then able, in my conversations with him.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I did not want anything said or done by me to defeat the hard work and effort put in by myself and by other members of the Executive to this Union of which we are all so proud. For Mr Sherry to suggest, as he has done, that he felt physically endangered can only be the most deliberate of fabrications and proves to my mind what I had come to suspect that his intentions were dishonourable and malicious.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Sherry has demonstrated to your Committee that he is prepared to break the law for his own purposes. In my opinion one of those purposes is to malign this Union and its members. I have no doubt that he is prepared to further break the law to achieve that end. When he was carrying out his research with my approval at the offices of the ETU he arrogantly abused the privileges I had given him. On one occasion I observed his going through confidential records of the Union which were irrelevant to his stated purposes and which he had no authority from me or any Officer of the Union to inspect. When I approached him about that he immediately left the Union's office. He made no explanation and gave no excuse and I took that to mean an admission by him that he knew his actions in that regard were improper. Relations between us became somewhat strained but I assert that the fault was his. I believe that his present evidence so far as it concerns me is false and malicious.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust that the foregoing assists you in relation to your enquiries. Should you require clarification of any issue contained herein please do not hesitate to contact me.</PARA>
<PARA>I now read a letter addressed again to Dr Laing, the secretary of that Committee. It is written by Mr A. Doodney. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Dr Laing</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have received your letter of 19th November. I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to the evidence given to your Committee, by Mr Sherry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The accusations made by Mr Sherry at page 388 of the Transcript are simply untrue. I emphatically deny that I ever offered Mr Neville $50,000 to opt out of the SEQEB dispute. Additionally there was only one fund with which I had any involvement. It was established to assist the striking SEQEB workers and their families. That Fund was administered by the striking workers of whom I was one. The proceeds of the Fund were used to provide financial relief. The administration of this Fund was intensively investigated by the Cooke inquiry. Commissioner Cooke, whilst making some minor criticisms, was obviously satisfied that the Fund complied with the purposes for which it was established.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Sherry clearly fails as a researcher. His evidence from my knowledge is tainted with information which is clearly untrue. The reference to the ATEA on page 388 totally misrepresents the true position. The case there was simply that members of the ATEA allowed payroll deductions to two accounts, one at the Sunstate Credit Union and the other at Credit Union Australia. Those monies were at practical intervals remitted to the SEQEB Strike Fund, administered by myself and several others. A receipt was issued for those monies on each occasion. Mr Sherry is attempting to infer that some clandestine relationship existed between Messrs Kane and McLean. This simply was not the case. In fact Mr Kane had nothing whatsoever to do with the administration of the Fund. Whilst the Executive of ETU assisted in the raising of funds they had no involvement in the administration of the Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having read the Transcript and from my own knowledge of the SEQEB dispute and related matters, it seems that Mr Sherry's evidence can carry no weight. His evidence is, at least on the occasion I have adverted, contrary to the findings of Commissioner Cooke. I trust that my responses are to your satisfaction. Should you require to discuss any matter contained herein at length please do not hesitate to contact me.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In recent days three things which I and millions of other Australians love and cherish have been the subject of demeaning and vitriolic attack. I refer to our Constitution, our Queen and our flag. All of these have been attacked by the man who parades as Prime Minister for all Australians. He has the temerity to talk of one nation when his actions have been to set a Australian against Australian, to create division and to demean our system of governance and the symbols which attend it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Long have I known of our need to be a good neighbour and trading partner in this our Pacific region. Indeed, it is a region far more diverse and complicated than the one embracing the term `Asia' and one which is multicultural by any definition. This is a region in which I have spent more than a decade working and building personal relationships to see us prosper and interact in this our own region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the Pacific Basin is a multicultural region. There are many tensions and differences within it, with some nations remembering Japan's occupation, others maintaining ties with old colonial powers. There are nations that are as independent as we are but value access to international trading markets through their European contacts. I cite Indonesia with Holland and the Philippines with Spain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that Australia, Singapore and Malaysia share a similar legal system and old alumni ties of the Colombo Plan is another example. One does not need, nor should one try, to jettison one's heritage and tradition in order to be a good neighbour and trading partner. To do so in some pathetic attempt to impress a neighbour would cause that neighbour to despise us. Our neighbours are proud of their own heritage and cannot countenance or comprehend those who do not value theirs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paul Keating's rabid attack on Britain is one against an old ally with whom we fought proudly in Flanders and Ypres in World War I, commemorated by the red poppy which we still wear each year to remember; in the Middle East, in Greece and in Crete in World War II&mdash;and, yes, World War II saw us suffer in the POW camps of Malaya and Singapore and on the Burma railway. Part of our tradition is the selfless sacrifice given by so many Australians in so many theatres of war to give us today the freedom we enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My father fought for me and my land in places such as Balikpapan and Borneo. He joined up, together with thousands of other Australians, after war was declared because Germany invaded Poland. Perhaps he remembered that General Monash was of part Polish Jewish heritage. I do not know. But I do know that he believed that the general was a great Australian. I know he believed himself that he was fighting against evil&mdash;the evil of Nazi Germany, of Hitler, of Mussolini. He knew all of that before Japan entered the war. He joined before he knew that his theatre of war was to be his own backyard. He and thousands like him believed in the dignity of the freedom of man and that it was worth fighting for in any part of the world. It was, if you like, an internationalist attitude. It was the sort of attitude we have when we negotiate in the GATT round&mdash;where we call for free and fair trade&mdash;when we appreciate the support of Britain with her attitude to the common agricultural policy and the need to bring down the subsidising of European trade in agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We similarly get angry with our major trading partner, Japan, over contemporary issues&mdash;that she forbids any rice should be imported into Japan. Again we express our anger at the United States of America for her export enhancement program, that is, subsidy by any other name of wheat into our markets. But at the end of the day we trade with them all and in large measure. Never in any of these negotiations is our Constitution, our Queen or our flag a term of that trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, our Constitution is worth fighting for. We have the oldest democratic constitutional monarchy in the world. It was the first of its kind to have full adult suffrage with women entitled to stand for elected office. It has given us a stable, peaceful, tolerant, multicultural society where people have come as migrants and have found a haven from conflict, a new start in life and a society which welcomes the contribution they make. Australia is what she is because of her institutions, the rule of law and the Constitution that enshrines and protects them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current newspaper reports about republican sentiment remind me of the reports that predicted that the last Labor Party assault on our Constitution would be successful. Of course, the referendum in 1988, designed to drastically alter our Constitution, was defeated in every State of Australia by a majority in every State. Australians are sensible people when they are acquainted with all the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been spurred on by a large number of letters that have crossed my desk from ordinary Australians who are enraged by the Prime Minister's remarks and the divisive debate which he is promoting. These letters have raised with me some interesting issues and have indicated the depth of feeling that exists. An example of one such letter poses some very fundamental questions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just how much better off would we be if we were a Republic? Would we have a better economy? Would we have less unemployment? Would a Republic make any difference in the lives of Australians? Would there be more money to open better hospitals?</PARA>
<PARA>These are the real issues of concern to ordinary, decent Australians. They are far more concerned about the state of economy, the tragedy of mass unemployment and the quality of schools and hospitals than they are about the diversion of the republican debate. Another wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My dear mates who died in the Battalion would not believe what has happened. I do not whinge. My sense of humour overcomes pain, but I ask you now, do not add insult to my injuries, by abolishing the symbol which represents the spiritual qualities which invest a nation with nobility and integrity.</PARA>
<PARA>To tear the monarch from our Constitution would mean that we get an elected head of state, and an elected President&mdash;and elected he or she would be, because no matter what method were used the party which wins the election would control the President. No longer would there be a head of state above politics&mdash;the monarch remaining constant and the Governor-General in charge on a day-to-day basis. A President would be in an elected party-political position, with only approximately one half of the population supporting him or her at any given time. Perhaps it would be the ultimate job-for-the-boys, with the government owning the President. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, wish to make some brief remarks in the current debate regarding Australia's Constitution and our flag. This debate will run for years, if not for decades. In many ways this is a pity because there is no doubt that the nation will become polarised over the value of central national symbols and institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make two predictions about this debate. First, it will do nothing for jobs and the reform of the economy. Worse, it is an attempt to distract the nation from these issues. Secondly, the debate will be very divisive. It has been instituted not because of any upsurge in community feeling, but principally because of the internal problems of the Australian Labor Party; a party which we have seen over the last nine years or so is without any clear beliefs or ideology; a party which, in its desperation, has decided to attempt to beat the nationalistic drum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The beat of this drum, however, is very selective and very discordant. At the same time, for example, as Mr Keating bashes the British, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) seems to suffer no embarrassment from grovelling to some countries in our region. As I say, the nationalistic drum that is being beaten is very selective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>There are a number of aspects of this debate on which I wish to comment today. The first relates to Mr Keating's call for an independent Australia. There is no argument from this side of the chamber about the need for Australia to remain an independent and sovereign country. The question I ask myself is whether, by focusing on our independent Constitution, Mr Keating is focusing on the wrong issue regarding the national independence of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have long been an independent country. Indeed, all Prime Ministers of this nation for 40 or 50 years have strongly believed in the independence of Australia, whether they be Labor or Liberal. I suggest that Mr Keating is the first Prime Minister for a long time who seems to have some doubts about this. When I was looking at the debates on the Australia Act which passed into law in 1985, I noticed that the former Labor Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen&mdash;a former colleague of Senator Robert Ray, who is in the chamber&mdash;told us that this Act reflected the fact that Australia had long been an independent and sovereign nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I think there was consensus that Australia was an independent country. But as far as Mr Keating is concerned, this is apparently not the case. I suggest to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that there are major threats to the independence of Australia. These are the sorts of issues that Mr Keating may care to focus on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>if he has some genuine concern about this country, as distinct from a genuine concern about his need to get back into the job after the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first major threat to Australia's independence is the massive build-up of foreign debt in this country, which has risen from about $23 billion when this Government came into office to over $160 billion today. In short, this Labor Government has put us in hock to foreigners. No doubt a number of people will realise the massive irony involved&mdash;that the man who speaks about the independence of this country has, in fact, through his policies put us in hock to foreigners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor members of parliament might ask themselves&mdash;if they have not already seen examples of how having a massive foreign debt effects the independence of this country&mdash;why Mr Keating brought about the recession that we had to have. Why did Mr Keating engineer this recession when he was Treasurer? It was because of the very fear that Australia, if it did not try to slow down the growth of foreign debt and deal with the balance of payments crisis, would have its credit rating downgraded. Foreign debt is a huge problem regarding the independence of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that a second threat to the independence of this nation relates to the sell-off of Australian assets which is occurring. When a company goes broke and is forced to sell its assets, most of us have seen how cheaply they are sold. When a country goes down the road to economic ruin it, too, has to sell off its assets. It has to sell them off cheaply to foreigners to raise money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are real threats to the independence of Australia but they do not relate to our Constitution. As Senator Bishop has so well demonstrated, our Constitution is arguably the world's oldest democratic constitution. It has maintained our national unity for almost 100 years. It is not the Constitution which is our problem. Indeed, our Constitution is our great pride. The independence of Australia is threatened by other factors, principally in the current period by the destruction of the economic standing of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some further aspects of irony in this debate. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper and the Fairfax press are running very strongly in support of the republican movement. In today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> there was a headline endorsing Mr Keating's call for a more independent Australia.

When one looks at the Labor Party logo, one basically sees the Australian flag. A central feature of the Liberal Party logo, the big `L', is also the Australian flag. The great political battles in this country are fought between two major political parties. Yet in the symbols of this fight there is also the symbol, at present, of our unity. Both our parties fly our great flag in their logos. This is going to change. This symbol of unity is going to be dropped. It is going to become a symbol of divisive debate between the parties. It will cause great division in the community. The responsibility may not be Senator Ray's, because he has told us that he supports our great flag; it will rest firmly with the most divisive Prime Minister we have had in our history&mdash;Paul Keating. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In Australia we sometimes express our incredulity by saying, `Pigs might fly'. I intend to inform the Senate of some flying pigs that left me incredulous. It was on a recent flight from London to Sydney, Qantas flight 2. Between Bangkok and Sydney, the breakfast menu in business class included `Canadian bacon and pineapple'. It is quite extraordinary that our national carrier, Qantas&mdash;which makes a big play of what a great national company it is&mdash;should see fit to serve Canadian bacon on its international flights. But worse than that, it sees fit to promote it as Canadian bacon.</PARA></TALK.START>

It may find it to be cheaper in the port that it flies out of. But, whether it is cheaper or not, we should not be describing it on the menu as` Canadian bacon'. It makes people believe that Canadian bacon is somehow better than Australian bacon, whereas the opposite is true&mdash;Australian bacon is a better product. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ray may not be particularly interested in the future of the Australian pork industry but we in the National Party and our Liberal Party colleagues certainly are.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition says that if a product is subsidised it should cop a countervailing duty. For Senator Ray's benefit and the Government's benefit, I note that in the last six months of last year $5.8m worth of Canadian pork flooded into this country&mdash;that works out at 243 tonnes of Canadian pork a day&mdash;not because it is a better product or because Australians want to buy Canadian pork, but because it is subsidised. It is part of the corrupt international trade scene and we let it go on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very serious point to all this that Senator Ray may not have appreciated is simply that we have to stand up to these subsidised products that are coming in from overseas. At the moment, this moribund Government has no interest at all in stopping the flood of dumped produce in this country for one simple reason: it disguises the fact that the Government has no anti-inflation policy. It does not matter if the product is cheaper and puts Australian workers out of the jobs. Provided it helps the Government hold down the CPI, that is fine by it. It is not fine by the people of the National Party or the Liberal Party who are on this side of the chamber.

That would be unlike the policy that this Government has, under which it can tell the customs authority, `Yes, you are allowed to find that the produce has been dumped and that there is material injury to the Australian industry, but you are not allowed to find that the dumping led to the material injury'. It is like finding a dead body with a bullet in it and saying that a causal link between the bullet and the person's death cannot be found.</PARA></TALK.START>

This can be done by going to a supermarket like Woolworths or by looking at the brand name and making sure that the brand is 100 per cent Australian, for example, Huttons or KR. If one is in any doubt, one should look at the label. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the light of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in his statement last week, handing another $51m of taxpayers' money to the highly subsidised textile, clothing and footwear industries, I wish in this matter of public interest debate today to express not only my great concern but also that of a great many people in the community about the failure of Australian footwear manufacturers, and for that matter overseas footwear manufacturers, to meet market demand. I am referring to the failure of both Australian and overseas sports shoe manufacturers to provide a specific or appropriate piece of footwear for Australia's 750,000 women netball players.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Netball, with about 750,000 players, is the biggest participator sport for women in this country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my State of South Australia, there are about 100,000 players who participate in netball. Approximately 10,000 of these suffer some form of injury during a playing season. Parents of school-aged players, players at all levels, team officials and medical authorities have raised this shoe issue with me because the incidence of injuries&mdash;specifically ankle, knee, leg or foot injuries&mdash;is not being adequately met by manufacturers of sports shoes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, obviously, with 750,000 Australian players, a local market which has been ignored for far too long. But apart from this burgeoning domestic market, there are 20 other nations which compete in international netball&mdash;New Zealand, Jamaica, England, the Cook Islands, Canada, Wales, Western Samoa, Scotland, the Irish Republic, Fiji, Vanuatu, Malaysia, Northern Ireland, Namibia, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, the Cayman Islands, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Trinidad and Tobago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Together, these countries represent millions of netball players but sadly they remain ignored by sporting shoe manufacturers.

Of course not. Are women netball players not worth the same investment?</PARA>

Although there are many surfaces on which the sport is played&mdash;for example, grass, flexipave and asphalt&mdash;players say that none of the current general sports shoes available suit.

Has the Minister's attention been drawn to an article by Senator Alston in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 2 March entitled, `Getting real on foreign aid', in which he suggests that the Government improve the quality of its aid program? What is the Minister's view of that article, if he has seen it?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="806" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Alston's article is nothing more or less than an absolutely pathetic attempt to justify the draconian cuts that the Opposition is proposing to make, if it ever gets the chance, to this Government's and this country's foreign aid program. In attempting to justify his Party's policy position in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>, Senator Alston in fact displays his total lack of understanding not only of Australia's aid program but also of the development process overall. In the latter respect, for example, he cites early on in the article South Korea and Taiwan as examples of countries which have developed, as he says, without significant foreign aid programs. He talks about the need for us to get real on foreign aid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He seems utterly oblivious to the fact that both countries in question, South Korea and Taiwan, have, as everyone knows, received absolutely massive assistance from the United States over many years. Most of Senator Alston's claims about the Australian aid program are equally spurious. He claims, for a start, that Australia should concentrate on the quality of its aid program and ensure that it measures up to strict performance criteria. In fact, Australia has an enviable international reputation as a deliverer of quality aid programs. Of course, individual programs have gone wrong occasionally over the years, as they have for every aid delivering country, and the most spectacular example to cite&mdash;and he does cite it, of course&mdash;is the Margarini project in Africa some decade ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Senator Alston should be aware, as he is obviously not, that AIDAB is one of the most prolific and public and respected evaluators of its own activities. Through a whole variety of appraisal, audit and review activities, it is continually assessing its assistance to countries, to sectors, to particular target groups. In fact, AIDAB devotes some $10m each year to various quality control initiatives. Again, Senator Alston, who is speaking not for himself but for the Opposition in this respect, displays a total lack of understanding when he moves on to criticise continuing budget support for Papua New Guinea as being anachronistic and counterproductive. As he ought to be aware&mdash;but manifestly is not, and I do not think Senator Hill is any the wiser on this subject&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought Senator Hill would appreciate that. The Government has reached formal agreement with Papua New Guinea to phase out all budget support by the end of the decade and to replace it with targeted program and project assistance. So there is no foundation whatsoever for the criticism of the present Government's aid program, priorities or policies. The point has been acknowledged for years. We have been trying to bring it about and we are in the process of bringing it about, and it is impossible to make it go any faster than that. Senator Alston should know that, if he does not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, he asserts that Australia should fund projects which build enduring political, economic and social structures. In fact, as he ought to be aware, this has been an absolutely central part of the whole aid program since its inception: targeting sustainable development activities in consultation with recipient governments and addressing quite specific issues that ensure sustainability such as the role of women and the question of the impact on the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, although the idea has apparently only recently occurred to him, Australia's aid program has for many years targeted its assistance on areas of our specific expertise, including agriculture and soil conservation&mdash;claims again that are totally misconstrued and misunderstood in the article. The point essentially is this: the failing of this article is a spectacular example of the kind of failing which runs through the whole policy of the Opposition, generally and more specifically, on aid; a failure to understand that development is achieved through a variety of aid mechanisms, including large development projects of the kind that Senator Alston has totally deprecated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition would reduce the aid budget by $209m over the next two years and, in addition, increase its costs by some $70m by introducing the goods and services tax. It would reduce the dollar value of that aid by $70m through GST alone while taking another $200m off the top. Yet the Opposition has the gall to criticise the Government's aid program. To go as the Opposition is proposing would not only totally destroy our credibility in this area but also damage the relationships we have with the whole developing world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a policy on the Opposition's part that is motivated by any concern for aid quality or any concern for the countries in our own region; it is a cynical attempt to find another area of saving in order to justify and pay for a goods and services tax.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I draw his attention to a call by former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser for all Australians to support the Cambodian peace plan. Does the Minister agree with the call made by Malcolm Fraser? Further, what action will the Government take to help the repatriation of refugees as one of the first crucial steps towards free elections in that country?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition in general and Senator Hill in particular will not be surprised to hear me say that the Government very much welcomes the constructive and helpful comments of former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser on the Cambodian peace process. He has urged all Australians to support the Government's efforts in the implementation of that peace settlement. I express not the expectation, but the hope, that Senator Hill in particular will take Malcolm Fraser's words very closely to heart.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the specific question of the repatriation of the 350,000 displaced Cambodians from camps along the Thailand-Cambodia border, that is a vital component of the overall peace settlement. Its success or failure will be a decisive factor in the implementation of the peace settlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has been designated by the UN Secretary-General as the lead agency for this repatriation operation. UNHCR is appealing for funding for a total budget for that program of $US116m. In response to that appeal, the Australian Government has contributed $1m to the pre-operational phase of the program, and the Government will certainly be considering in due course a further contribution for the operational and reintegration phases. The Government is concerned to see that these displaced persons are given every opportunity to return to their chosen place of residence in Cambodia in security and dignity. We are taking a very close interest in the preparation and conduct of this entire operation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce relates to the report that the English translation of the report of a high level investment team from Japan released on Monday in Tokyo concluded that the `MFP remains an unrealisable dream'. It is also reported that the Australian Embassy changed this translation to describe the MFP as a `project with a lot of potential'. Were two translations produced&mdash;an earlier one and a changed later one; who ordered this change to the English translation of the Japanese; was it done at the behest of the Australian Government and/or the South Australian Government; who carried out the changed translation and where; and did Mr Bruce Guerin play any part in the request for or ordering of the changed translation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answers to these three questions are yes, yes and yes. I am aware that Leigh Purnell of the Metal Trades Industry Association responded to the remarks that were made at a seminar by Mr Ian McLachlan, the shadow Minister for industry and commerce. Mr McLachlan chanted on, as the members of the Opposition are wont to do, that only total labour market reform is the answer to our economic problems. The continuous chant seems to be that total labour market reform is the only answer to our problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, on this occasion what Mr McLachlan got was a blast of reality from the Metal Trades Industry Association, a major employer group at the sharp end of work force reform in this country which was talking about the realities of what is in fact the change that is going on in the Australian community. The Association said that a total Rambo, total labour market deregulation, deregulation at all costs approach&mdash;the sort of chanting mantra that comes from the Opposition&mdash;is not the answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also said that to pretend that the labour market is rigid, that there is not in fact a revolution in work in Australia, is to ignore the realities&mdash;that there is in fact a revolution in work in Australia; that in fact significant change has already occurred, that significant change is in hand, that significant change is in prospect and that that is being done and managed within the existing system. We will shortly amend that system to further facilitate this speed. But what we will not do is throw over the entire system, which is what the Opposition preaches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In truth, we are now witnessing the management of change smoothly in the Australian workplace. We have done that by our processes of the structural efficiency principle, by workplace reform, by a cooperative approach rather than the old confrontationist approach&mdash;the approach that again the Opposition preaches. We have institutionalised cooperation and have put in place workplace and productivity agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that when I talk to industry spokespersons and to industry leaders, which I do very frequently, they all tell me that what they do not want is a reinstitutionalisation of confrontation. They do not want to be pushed into making war on their own employees, which is what the Opposition's policy is. Industries want to work with us to achieve the significant change that is already there, consolidate that and move on to an even better and more productive climate in Australian industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. I refer the Minister to his promise in Question Time on 8 October last year to make representations to the National Food Authority through the Minister for Health for the Authority to review country of origin labelling size. In view of the Minister's excellent progress while Minister responsible in ensuring that unpackaged imported food now bears 4.5 millimetre labels, with  imported fruit juice now being clearly labelled as such, has a National Food Authority review and survey of the rules relating to labelling been commenced? Has he requested the Minister for Health to include a review of country of origin label size? Considering that there has now been an industry application to the Authority to review labelling size, I ask whether this review, which normally takes up to 12 months, could be accelerated as a matter of urgency under section 37 of the National Food Authority Act.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell, along with Arch Bevis in Queensland, has taken a particular interest in the question of the size of labels which indicate whether a particular product is a food product of Australia rather than from overseas. It has been very gratifying to see in the last week that in relation to unpackaged food&mdash;nuts, fish, fruit and vegetables&mdash;there is now a requirement that those unpackaged foods should carry a label of 4.5 millimetres indicating whether they come from overseas. I think that will enable Australians in the marketplace to make choices that aid our farmers and our fisherpeople in their occupations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth noting that only last week controversy arose in Queensland where a particular supermarket chain was forced to withdraw some 9,000 packets of nuts from its shelves after it was accused of misleading consumers about the origin of the nuts. Apparently the chain had a label which in large print said `Produce of Australia', and below that in very much smaller print was a message that read `or China'. That was thought by many to be misleading. I have referred it to the Trade Practices Commission for its investigation of whether this was a practice that could be regarded as deceptive and misleading in the marketplace and therefore contrary to the provisions of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact that the question of the size of the print on the labels indicating whether a product is produced in Australia or overseas has been a matter of some controversy. At the moment it is 1.5 millimetres.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do not forget that it is only a minimum. If Australian manufacturers of food products want to encourage Australians to purchase those products, they should ignore the minimum requirement and advertise that fact in very bold print as an incentive for Australians in the marketplace, the supermarkets, to support their own farmers and those of the fishing industry, for example.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the National Food Authority is considering an application from the Committee of Direction of Fruit Marketing, which I think is a Queensland-based organisation, to increase the print size of country of origin labelling on packaged goods from 1.5 millimetres to a 3-millimetre minimum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The application will be dealt with by the National Food Authority under the public procedures laid down in the National Food Authority Act. That will involve the Authority making a full assessment, after seeking public comment on the application. If it decides to prepare a draft standard of variation of the standard, again it will need to seek the input of interested parties. It has a statutory obligation to make a recommendation in respect of an application within 12 months of receiving that application. In other words, I believe that it should be able to complete this task by the end of the year or a little after that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For that reason, it will not be possible for the National Food Standards Council to consider the matter at its meeting in April 1992. However, I suggest that Senator Boswell and other parties with an interest in this matter should take the opportunity to make further submissions to the Authority. I am quite sure that those submissions will be taken into account in its deliberations.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two key flaws in the Opposition's modelling of the GST. I illustrate those by referring to the Treasury model. First, the Opposition is trying to make one pot of money&mdash;I said this yesterday&mdash;do two things: compensate for the effects of the GST part of the package and compensate for bracket creep with the same amount of money. Secondly, the Opposition has not attempted to fully analyse the distributional effects of the welter of taxing and spending changes it suggests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One very important thing which has emerged in the last day or two is that the Opposition package shows that it does not understand bracket creep. Honourable senators opposite show that they do not understand bracket creep by the questions they ask. They did understand bracket creep when they purported to introduce tax indexation during the last Liberal Government. They introduced tax indexation in response to an election promise and it lasted one year. When they introduced it at the time of the last Liberal Government and it lasted one year, they assessed it on the basis of the CPI, not on the basis of wage movements, which is what the present Fightback proposal purports to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition shows that it does not understand that wage growth and inflation are different things. Senator Hill frowns because these are concepts that he, as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, has never grappled with. Indexation of the income tax scales requires that they be adjusted by the rate of inflation rather than the growth in average earnings. The Opposition has used the wrong figures to calculate the necessary indexation adjustment of the tax scales.</PARA>

The Minister will recall speeches he made to the legal fraternity in Tasmania and other States at functions marking the official opening of the legal year, in which he said that the coalition's Fightback package would reduce the amount of Federal funding for legal aid and result in an increase of 15 per cent in costs to legal aid work referred to private lawyers. As the shadow Treasurer has directly refuted this statement, does the Minister now admit that he was wrong and that he misled the legal fraternity at the most important event in its calendar? If so, will he now publicly apologise to the Australian legal fraternity? Also, was the Minister aware at the time he made those speeches that his Government intended to impose by regulation gigantic fee increases for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Family, Federal and High courts? Those regulations were tabled by the Government last week.

This Government can be extremely proud of its record in that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>

When that is apportioned amongst the legal aid commissions throughout Australia, that must translate to many thousands of cases which will be unable to be funded. This means that when clients approach legal aid commissions for assistance&mdash;for example, in the Magistrates Court when facing a criminal charge, or in relation to Family Court matters&mdash;those legal aid commissions will be $10m less able to provide those particular services.

The Canadians found that the legal aid commissions, as is the case here, are not quite properly described as benevolent institutions, charitable institutions or businesses providing services; they are a bit of a mixture, as Senator Vanstone, Senator Durack and others will know, because of the contributions regime. It is not easy to put them into a simple definition. In Canada, with the GST, the legislature explicitly and expressly in the statute excluded legal aid commissions from the operation of the GST.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of the circumstances described in this question from Senator Lees. To the best of my knowledge, copper sulphate is not applied to river waters. In fact, a copper based algaecide is routinely applied to reservoirs designated as town water supplies and sometimes those waters are used for irrigation, although one would consider that, of course, a copper based algaecide applied to water for human consumption would be unlikely to have an impact on vegetable growth that would put the vegetables above any such limit to which Senator Lees referred in her question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also aware that the algaecide was applied to the river water at Bourke by the Bourke Shire Council, although the New South Wales Pollution Control Commission became aware of it and the Council subsequently stopped this practice immediately. However, there is no evidence that this would cause the problem to which reference has been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not aware of farmers being prohibited from selling crops because of copper contamination, although there is no reason why the Commonwealth Government would be aware of that directly. If that occurred, then in this context the South Australian Government would be likely to be the government made aware of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the third part of the question related to alternative ways of handling algal bloom. The preferred method of controlling algal bloom is to address the underlying cause, which is nutrient accession to receiving waters. Reducing nutrient input is a matter of minimising nutrient outflows from point sources such as sewerage plants, and from diffuse sources such as animal manure from agricultural lands. Those issues can only be addressed in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short term the most practical approach is to manage river flow regimes to minimise conditions suitable for algal growth.

This is entirely in line with the Federal Government's strategy in relation to the provision of primary health care, particularly in rural areas throughout Australia. We know that the question of the oversupply of doctors is not a crude question of numbers; it is also a question of their distribution and their concentration in urban, as opposed to rural, communities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) With reference to the anomaly that exists as a result of a ruling issued by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) with regard to the selling of race horses for more than $5000 are owners now to be taxed on any profit made on the sale of a horse for more than $5000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) If owners are not entitled to a tax deduction if the horse is sold at a loss, why does this unfair and unjustified situation exist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. Where a race horse is owned for personal use or enjoyment and not for the purpose of income production then such a horse is classified under the capital gains tax provisions of the tax law as a non-listed personal use asset. Taxation Ruling IT 2585 explains the operation of the capital gains provisions to non-listed personal use assets, particularly in relation to horses raced as a hobby. Where the cost base or indexed cost base of a non-listed personal-use asset would otherwise be less than $5,000, the cost base or indexed cost base is taken to be $5,000. The effect is that a taxpayer will accrue a capital gain calculated under the normal rules, or calculated as though the cost base or indexed cost base was $5,000, whichever gives the lesser gain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The disposal of a non-listed personal use asset does not give rise to an allowable capital loss. As such assets are primarily for personal use, if these losses were to be deductible against capital gains generally the tax system would be effectively subsidising the related personal consumption expenditures since the stream of services provided by the asset remains untaxed.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the contrary it is Senator Short's question and the Opposition package that contain the flaws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Short does not understand the difference between inflation and wages growth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Point 1: the impact of bracket creep on any particular household is calculated by comparing the tax payable under the legislated tax scales with what would be payable if the tax thresholds had been indexed for inflation since some base period.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just to make that clear, inflation is measured as the increase in the CPI, not by growth in average earnings or the price of a Ferrari.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Treasury analysis, the relevant comparison then is between the tax payable under the Opposition's proposed tax scales and that which would have been paid had the legislated rate scale been indexed for inflation between the June quarter 1993 and the March quarter 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Point 2: in clear contrast to how you index the tax thresholds, the only way to calculate tax revenue from bracket creep is to calculate the growth in taxable incomes, not the rate of inflation.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, you collect revenue from wage increases, not increases in the CPI per se.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Growth in taxable incomes is usually approximated by growth in average earnings, not the increase in the CPI.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the approach adopted by the Opposition in its manifesto and it is exactly the same approach that was adopted by the official agencies in costing those proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition claimed that the tax cuts it was proposing would return $3 billion of bracket creep. In fact, the Treasury analysis shows that the true amount that should be returned is $4.2 billion.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This $4.2 billion reflects the difference between the tax that would be paid under the Opposition's scales and what would be paid if the legislated scales were indexed for inflation between the June quarter 1993 and the March quarter 1996.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just make sure you understand this&mdash;that does not mean that there is an additional $1.2 billion floating around. It simply means that within the total revenue the Opposition's proposals would raise, the amount they are calling bracket creep is understated and the amount they are calling `legitimate' revenue is overstated.</PARA>

<PARA>Senator Collins in his answer to me today said that the reason for the expenditure of $20m in the Port of Townsville was to secure the prospects of 900 workers at Yabulu. Senator Collins was clearly wrong in that remark. I do not know the reason for it. Greenvale Nickel, which is the company to which Senator Collins referred, ran out of viable ore and was required to import ore from New Caledonia to refine at Yabulu. The most cost efficient way to do so and to avoid double handling was to build a jetty at Halifax Bay. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Then why did you not give them $80m, if you are fair dinkum? Meanwhile, Mount Isa and Greenvale came to an agreement for Greenvale to use one of the MIM berths, at a very cheap cost. A project that has jokingly been called around Townsville `Reynolds memorial', which none of the users would have a bar of, popped up in the Keating economic statement. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is quoted as saying, not in respect of this but in respect of the economy as a whole, `You are only cheating yourself if you run policies which have scarce national savings going to the wrong places'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have tried to make sure that our scarce savings go to the most productive places. Clearly, this money is not going to the most productive place. What is it to be spent on? Senator Collins told Senator Reynolds and me that it would be spent on a rail loop. As I indicated in my question, there is already a rail loop at the Port of Townsville. The rail loop cost the Port Authority nothing because it was installed by the owners of the Duchess phosphate deposit some years ago. Honourable senators may or may not be aware that that project never got off the ground. But the rail loop remains. The question is: why build another rail loop? There have been anecdotal stories around Townsville as to why Mr Reynolds wants to do this, but I will not use this place to quote them because they are somewhat defamatory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The balance of $12m was to be spent on land reclamation and dredging associated with the outer harbour fantasy. In fact, when Mr Reynolds was asked, `If this is only phase one of a $80m investment, when is the rest of the project going to be finished?', he said, `I don't know'. I do not believe that it will ever be finished. These are the facts. I do not care what Senator Collins says or what Senator Reynolds says by way of interjection, I checked with the users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raises a very serious question with respect to the sixteenth Keating economic statement. How many other examples of this sort of wastage of taxpayers' money will pop out of the woodwork. Why did the Government do it? Did it not do its homework? Is it a pay-off to a Labor mate for some sort of self-glorification? It highlights a degree of vandalism. I say `vandalism' because the Government has vandalised the country not just in respect of the taxpayer but in respect of the record number of bankruptcies we have had and the million unemployed. Hence, we have had an attack on the Hewson Fightback package which, for the first time, offered hope. The package offered a ray of hope to a whole lot of people out there who had not hope and still have no hope under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the latest economic package from Prime Minister Keating and the acid test will be in six, seven or eight months time. What will be the situation then? Will those million people have work? Will we be on track? Will there be more import replacement? Will more real jobs be created? Ideally, as an Australian, I would like to say yes, but I doubt it. That will be the acid test and it will be what brings this Government down at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to clarify a misleading remark made by Senator Collins in his answer. The Opposition clearly supports infrastructure spending where it has clear cost benefits and contributes to productivity and efficiency and where it means more exports or real job creation. We do not disagree with that. I, as a Queenslander, support the building of the rail link from Acacia Ridge to Fishermans Island. I think it should have been done years ago. However, the expenditure on what appears to be&mdash;on my own investigations and on discussions with the users; they are the people who count&mdash;a white elephant is nothing more than abuse of the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has an obligation to give clear answers as to what this is all about. The $20m could have been spent; I would not deny north Queensland the expenditure of $20m. The more that can be spent up there&mdash;one of the most progressive parts of this country&mdash;the more I am sure my colleagues would support me on this; and they would support the Government if it did it. However, this $20m has been spent in the wrong place and it raises serious doubts about the whole integrity of this package, which is just throwing money at something which cannot be and has not been justified. </PARA>

Senator Collins has tried to get some kudos and brownie points for the Labor Party by making smart announcements in the north&mdash;in the Townsville region. He even wasted some $300,000 worth of taxpayers' money to establish an office for himself in that particular town that he has used only once this year. He had to do something to try to bail out his mates in the Labor Party controlled Townsville City Council and the Queensland State Government over the nickel treatment plant which is about to close down.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is all sorts of trouble within the Labor Party&mdash;different factions supporting different proposals because there are 1,000 jobs at stake. Heaven knows, Townsville needs jobs. The Townsville region does not need 1,000 people to be thrown out of work; it does not need another 1,000 people to be put on the already huge unemployment queue. The Labor Party has to do something but it does not know quite what to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area has three State Labor members. Some of them want to do something; some of them want to do something else. We have a Queensland government that does not quite know what it wants to do. We have an atrocious Labour Council that has always been anti-development. We have Mr Lindsay and Senator Reynolds, who I think belong to different factions and who are always at each other's throats on different things. The Labor Party knows that Mr Lindsay is about to lose the contest for the electorate of Herbert to the Liberal candidate, Mr Peter Hazard, and it is petrified about it. It had to do something to pork barrel some money in there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problem is that half the Labor Party in Townsville wants one thing and the other half wants something different. The south Townsville region, in which the electorate of the Queensland Minister for Small Business, Mr Geoff Smith, is based, contains a lot of people who are very concerned about the dust nuisance that might arise from the port being used to import nickel ore and also the problems with rail and interruption to traffic. The Labor Party aldermen who hold the wards out that way are also petrified that they are going to be tossed out by their traditional Labor voters at the next election because of the menace of dust, noise and traffic interruptions&mdash;all the sorts of things that are causing absolute turmoil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you would well know, Mr Deputy President, the Labor Party in Townsville is in absolute turmoil over the whole thing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my reading of the `Done Nation' or `One Job' statement, $20m is to be used on port infrastructure in Queensland, including the Townsville port. It did not say there was going to be $20m for the Townsville port; it said there was $20m for Queensland, including the Townsville port. I tried to find out just how much of that was going to the Townsville port. I could not get anything from anyone who might know anything about it. I ended up getting my information from radio and newspaper journalists who told me what Mr Lindsay was telling them. I still do not quite know where they get all the figures from. I do know that to do what needs to be done, the Townsville port area needs something like $70m to $80m, not $20m, and not the $25m that was leaked by the Labor Party the day before the `One Job' statement was released. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So one wonders just what it is all about. There are a lot of projects in the Townsville region that are very deserving of government spending. I only have to point out to you, Mr Deputy President, that the roads in that area desperately need a lot of funding. We get lots of promises from Mr Lindsay and Mr Brown&mdash;we got lots of promises from Mr Hawke when he used to come up there every now and again to bolster up Mr Lindsay's chances of retaining his seat&mdash;but we never see much action in respect of roads up there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really need that Queensland nickel plant to keep going. It needs a hell of a lot of support.

This Federal Government tried to bail out the Queensland Government by deferring decisions all the time, so that no decision would have to be made and the Labor Party would not have these huge fights between its right wing and its left wing and its environmental wing and its pro-development wing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am offered a sewerage dam from Western Australia; I understand that they do not even know what it is about over there. I know there is a lot of muck coming out of the Labor Party as a result of the Royal Commission there, and maybe that is what the sewerage treatment plant is for&mdash;to throw in all the muck that has come out about the Labor Government in Western Australia as a result of that Royal Commission. I suspect that that is what it is about. But these goodies all stop at Brisbane. There is nothing for the north.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government threw in this paltry $3m for a duplication of University Road. Neither the City Council nor the aldermen&mdash;in fact nobody&mdash;knew where it was to go. It needs the duplication of a bridge before the road goes ahead, but there is absolute turmoil there. It was one of those things thrown in in a desperate but very vain and unsuccessful attempt to retain Mr Lindsay in his job as the Federal member for Herbert. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to say that the Liberal candidate, Mr Peter Hazzard, will be representing the seat of Herbert, which is based on Townsville, after the next election. Townsville will then have some decent representation. It will then get some real projects going&mdash;real projects such as Townsville used to have when a Liberal government was in power. I refer to the Burdekin Dam, the Lavarack Army Barracks and the marine institute&mdash;all of those really beneficial projects for Townsville which were all initiated when Herbert was represented by Mr Duke Bonnett as the Liberal member, followed by Mr Gordon Dean as the Liberal member. We need to return to the days when Townsville was getting something. It certainly needs some government assistance but, as Senator Parer pointed out, is this the right way to go?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that there are many other ways in which money could be put into that area. Mr Lindsay does not say much about it. Senator Reynolds is almost speechless when it comes to promoting the North. I continue to try to get government money into the North&mdash;into Townsville, into Cairns, into Mackay, into Mount Isa&mdash;but this Labor Government is absolutely pathetic in the way it deals with it. It only does something when an election is coming up&mdash;an election which it knows it will not win this time. The whole thing needs a lot of attention and some real inquiry into just what is happening in that area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion by Senator Parer naturally invites very considered comment in light of the question asked yesterday and the two questions asked today of Senator Collins, in response to which he attempted to blur the issues relating to the One Nation statement and its effect on northern Australia and, particularly today, with regard to proposals for Townsville and the remote and rural areas of northern Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am attracted to the idea put forward by Senator Macdonald that an inquiry should be initiated into the area of transport facilities and infrastructure in northern Australia.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March of last year, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications, Warren Snowdon, convened an important conference in Alice Springs relating to the issues that impacted on transport in northern Australia. I recently had two questions on notice in this Senate with regard to those transport needs, and I refer in particular to Senate Questions 1662 and 1663 directed to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Richardson) and the Minister for Shipping and Aviation and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia (Senator Collins). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very detailed answers that have came back in those areas&mdash;and I use the word `detailed' because they were lengthy&mdash;do not really give any true indication of where decisions could and should have been taken, such as where the proper infrastructure ought to be provided with regard to road works, rail works, port works and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Senator Macdonald and Senator Parer have highlighted the port development and other needs of Townsville&mdash;and the apparent and funny information and advice that has been given to Labor politicians in north Queensland&mdash;I am prompted to raise the question of the Alice Springs to Darwin railway because this matter, rightly, has been put on the agenda by the Northern Territory Government. I ask specifically what detailed advice has the Government given to State Labor leaders and State Labor members in Queensland and the Northern Territory, particularly as they relate to the provisions in this One Nation statement?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this week in the Northern Territory Parliament, the Leader of the Opposition in the Northern Territory, Brian Ede, said&mdash;and I quote from the Northern Territory <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>: tax breaks and incentives in the form of infrastructure bonds, accelerated depreciation, and development allowances that were announced in the Prime Minister's One Nation package provide taxation incentives of up to $300m for the completion of the Alice Springs to Darwin rail link and port facilities in Darwin.</PARA>
<PARA>What is the basis of Mr Ede's claim, particularly as there is not one reference to the Alice to Darwin railway in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> and as the $300m is not supported in the forward estimates of outlays or revenue given by the Government in the One Nation statement?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer and Senator Macdonald have very rightly raised the adequacy and the provision of the $20m with regard to the port of Townsville. How is it integrated? How is it linked? Where is it provided for in the forward estimates? If one looks at page 97 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> document one sees a map which shows the rail infrastructure of Australia. It outlines 12 rail projects. Of course, as Senator Macdonald has rightly pointed out, they are all south of Brisbane. They are all, in one way or another, encompassed in marginal seats. What it really does show is that the only detailing of rail projects that shows Darwin connected to the rest of Australia is by the shore line, not by any other line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have to address these important issues and apparently conflicting information that has been presented to the Senate&mdash;whether in answer to questions that have been tabled or not. Certainly I anticipate that in the Senate Estimates this year we will put the Government on notice that Senator Macdonald and I will be pursuing a whole range of these issues very properly with the departmental officials at that particular time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In comparison to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS>, and contrary to what Senator Collins said here both yesterday and today, the Fightback package does outline very significant and major advantages for people living in remote and northern Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS>, and Senator Collins in his answers yesterday and today, did not mention the very significant advantages that will flow through transport and freight costs, particularly because of Fightback completely abolishing the petroleum excise, abolishing wholesale sales tax and also abolishing payroll tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significant freight and personal advantages that will flow to every taxpayer in remote and northern Australia are very adequately illustrated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> Of course, there is not one mention of any of that in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> or in any statement by Senator Collins. What we get thrown at us is purely partial information pulled out of the Treasury documents.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The interim statement of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) finishes with the comment that there will be a delay of about two months before the response can be tabled. It is most unusual that a Minister does not present a report personally; that the Minister on duty does it when it is a Government response to a major report made by a committee of this Parliament, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing that is quite unusual about this is the delay. We are talking about a report that was tabled in the Senate on 2 December 1991, which happens to be three months ago. The convention of the Parliament is that the government of the day responds to major reports within three months. Yet today we are given something that is called an interim report, and it is not a report in any sense at all; it is just advice that perhaps in two months time we will get a response. That is five months after a major report has been tabled in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is very important because it relates to the place of the Defence Force Reserves in Australia. We all know that the Government is in great difficulty with the subject of defence as a result of its consistent cost-cutting exercises. With the very great rundown in the number of uniformed personnel in the three Services, the place of reserves to flesh out the Australian Defence Force has become even more critical. That is why it is important that the Government take notice of the report and make a response to the Parliament and account for its stewardship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, what the Government is on about is moving to extend the time as long as it can and hope that the Committee's report will be buried. As the deputy chairman of the Committee that presented this report, I was more than interested to see how the report would be received in the Defence community. The response from Canberra was very interesting. If I may use a word that infuriates the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and refer to those uniformed members of the Defence Force who love to live in air-conditioned offices, as careerists, as opposed to the warriors in the Defence Force&mdash;</PARA>

When the report came out, the denizens of Russell were extremely disturbed by it because it showed up all the deficiencies they had been covering up so carefully for so many years&mdash;all the shortcomings in the capability of the current Defence Force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While our report was on the Reserves, it also inevitably involved some of the readiness and the capability of the permanent forces. There is no way we can dissect one part of the defence forces from the other. Our report showed up all the things the Government had been hiding with its talk about readiness and all the rest of it. Shortcomings were shown up in the Gulf war, when we found we had no forces at all that we could dispatch. It was only after the expenditure of about $100m that we got two ships we could send to the Gulf for a patrolling task. We had no unit in the Army we could dispatch onto the battlefield for conventional land warfare. We had nothing in the Air Force because we lack any electronic warfare capability to operate in a hostile situation. </PARA>

That is rather ironic, given the way the interdepartmental committee responded to Mr Alan Wrigley's report of about 18 months ago. The Government attacked the Wrigley report and said that the readiness standards were far too long to be practical in any way at all. The word is now that it is going to attack our report on the basis that our readiness standards are too short to be attainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that at present we have readiness standards for the Australian Defence Force Reserves of 90 days, 180 days and 360 days. We devote quite a bit of our report to explaining how impractical those levels of readiness are. If we have a unit on 360 days readiness before it can go on active service, we might just as well recruit off the street, as we did in the Vietnam era. A soldier can certainly be trained in 360 days, and there is no point meeting the expense and all the other overheads involved in keeping them on the Reserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee was very conscious of the high cost of readiness. In no sense at all are we saying that the whole of the Defence Force has to be ready to go in 30 days or 60 days or anything like that. Such a move would be quite nonsensical. There is a very high cost involved in maintaining high standards of readiness, but at the same time we have to recognise that it is a very different world we live in in 1992 from what we lived in 1932 or 1922, when long lead times and long training periods were quite possible. The facts of life are now that we need a Defence Force with a high degree of capability that is seen by other people and we need to have some of those parts of the Defence Force at a reasonably high standard of readiness. We also have to be able to bring the rest of the Defence Force up in a reasonable time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the careerists at Russell Hill to whom I have referred, the rest of the uniformed services have been extremely enthusiastic and laudatory of the contents of the report. I have had many letters from all over Australia congratulating the Committee on bringing down a report of this nature. A difficulty we had in writing the report was that it was tightly written to a set of requirements laid down by the Minister. The No.1 requirement on the list of requirements we were given was that we had to write about the readiness for the reservists in relation to DOA87. That, of course, as everyone knows, is now hopelessly outdated. We are in the post-Cold War era and that document is utterly irrelevant to the needs of Australia. We did show that in the light of the standards set by the Government, as a consequence of DOA87, the Government had failed miserably to attain even those minimal standards that were defined in DOA87. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not surprising, because the history of Labor governments in Australia is one of total neglect of defence. History is a subject that might as well be written in Urdu or Sanskrit for the Labor Party. I do not think anyone in the Labor Party has any idea of history whatsoever. People such as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) should be barred by statute from ever speaking in public on matters of historical significance. The attack on Britain earlier this week relating to the defence of Australia in 1942 was a scandalous travesty, a misstatement of historical facts. The charge that Britain did nothing to defend Malaya has been dealt with by notable historians in the Australian press, and I do not wish to debate that here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things Mr Keating was bleating about was the fact that there was opposition to bringing back the AIF divisions that were overseas. The 6th, the 7th and the 9th divisions were overseas at the time. The Labor Government made a big thing about the fact that they did not come back overnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that under Labor Prime Minister Curtin in 1942, the country was facing its gravest danger, its gravest hours; the Labor Government came in in 1941. </PARA>

Prime Minister Curtin failed to take the obvious step of marshalling Australian resources. In the period from 1939 to 1945 over one million Australians were in the Army alone, and that from a population of only seven million at the time&mdash;quite an astonishing performance. Because the Labor Party was committed to its ancient pacifist philosophies, despite the fact that we were in the gravest danger ever, it would not introduce conscription; it would not commit Australian forces to attack the enemy. We had something like half a million people in the Army in uniform at the time. Poor old Curtin was bleating to the Americans and the British to send troops to die for Australia, yet we were not prepared to use our own resources.</PARA></TALK.START>

The relevance of that to this report is that we now have a three-tiered army instead of a two-tiered army as we had under Curtin. Under Curtin, we had the AIF and the militia. There was a gap between those two of enormous and debilitating consequence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this Government, we have a regular army, which is now quite minuscule because it was reduced to only four battalions after the force structure review, and we have an army reserve which is now absolutely reduced to impotence because of a lack of resources from this Government. We now have the third team coming in&mdash;the Ready Reserve&mdash;which is neither fish nor fowl. So, in a sense, the Government has become even worse than it was in 1942-45. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we are on the subject of reserves, I put to the Minister that he ought to consider the commitment of a reserve unit to Cambodia. Again, this is another reason for him to take some time to read this excellent report that was presented to the Parliament over three months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been reduced to the tragic circumstance where we have only four Regular Army battalions. This is quite extraordinary for a country of 17 million. But putting all of that aside, two of those battalions are in the operational deployment force in Townsville with 3 Brigade. It is very unlikely that the Government will commit one of those two battalions to service in Cambodia. It will probably send a battalion out of 1 Brigade at Holsworthy since it got rid of 6 Brigade as part of the Ready Reserve scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that the commitment to Cambodia will be far longer than the Government recognises at present. While I would hope that it is a short and, above all, a safe deployment of Australian forces, the possibility has to be faced at this stage that this could run into 12, 18, 24 months or even longer. I have very little faith in some of the factions that are involved in the negotiations in Cambodia reaching an amicable agreement and holding it in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are in Cambodia for a period in excess of 12 months the Government will be bound to exercise some degree of rotation of the ground forces that are deployed there. If it follows the same practice it used in the Gulf with the ships, it will probably nominate a six-month period. In that case, there is an opportunity for a reserve unit to go to Cambodia and replace one of the two regular battalions that could go up there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The beauty of the Cambodian deployment is that it allows time to call for volunteers from the Reserves and to train them beforehand. We could send a battalion like 49 RQR up there. To do something like that would have enormous benefits with respect to morale in the Army Reserve which, under both Liberal and Labor governments, has never been committed since the end of the Second World War. There is really no point in having an army reserve force if it is never used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, the Government does assign the lowest priority to defence.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON MIGRATION REGULATIONS ON CHANGE OF STATUS&mdash;MARRIAGE AND DE FACTO RELATIONSHIPS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs review its provision of statistical data in its annual reports with a view to providing more detailed and more comprehensive statistical data in future annual reports, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Statistical data provided in annual reports be provided in a standard format from year to year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted. The 1989/90 Annual Report did not provide the appropriate base level data. This matter has been addressed in the 1990/91 Annual Report and the Department's Program Performance Statement 1991/92 for Parliament now in preparation. Relevant systems are currently the subject of review by the Department, with a view to improving support to decision makers, and enhancing statistical reports. More detailed statistical reporting is expected to be available in 1992/93.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tho Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs include in its training program for those officers who determine applications on spouse/de facto grounds information on different cultural values and practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted. The Department is currently developing a comprehensive national training program for all residence decision makers. The course will be offered to over 200 residence decision makers within the current financial year and will focus on lawful decision making, the proper exercise of discretionary powers, and issues of cross cultural sensitisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs revise its Procedures Advice Manual (PAM) to ensure that officers are aware that different cultural factors impinge on marriage relationships and that such factors should be considered in the assessment of the "genuine and continuing" marriage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current guidelines for the assessment of the genuine and continuing nature of a marriage or de facto relationship already provide that decision makers should have regard to all the circumstances of a relationship and in particular the range of factors listed in the guidelines. Further, it is made clear to Departmental officers that the factors detailed in the guidelines are not exhaustive, but indicia as to the genuine and continuing nature of the relationship to be taken into account in a full assessment of the circumstances of a relationship. While the guidelines do not specifically mention cultural factors, the focus of the assessment is on the genuineness of the relationship, rather than whether the relationship conforms to a particular stereotype. These guidelines are consistent with guidelines used by other portfolios, such as the Department of Social Security, and as such conform to the Commonwealth position on such matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the commitment to training in cross cultural sensitisation outlined in the response to Recommendation 3 above, I believe that the current policy provisions are sufficiently flexible to accommodate a range of cultural factors impinging on marriage relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 5.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The statement in the PAM concerning de facto relationships be clarified so that decision makers and immigration advisers are made aware of what de facto relationships are not in accordance with Australian social values.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted. The de facto relationships not in accordance with Australian social values and not mentioned in the De Facto Marriage Relationships PAM subject are relationships between people within prohibited relationships. Item 4.9.1 of the PAM subject on Marriage and Divorce with minor modifications will be included in the PAM subject on De Facto Marriage Relationships as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Australia, relationships between parties who are within a certain range of relationships with each other are void under Australian law. These relationships:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">are between a person and an ancestor or descendent of the person (i.e., parent and child or grandparent and grandchild)</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">are between a brother and a sister (whether full blood or half blood)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These relationships include adoptive relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 6.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legal advice be sought on the advice given in the Procedures Advice Manual, namely that it is permissible to exclude under age legally married applicants until both spouses are over the marriageable age.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted. Where only one partner is domiciled in Australia both the applicant and his/her spouse must be over the marriageable age.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where both the applicant and his/her spouse are domiciled overseas and the marriage is recognised in that country then the marriage will be recognised in Australia except</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">while either party is under 16 years of age (s.88D(3) of the Marriage Act 1961 as amended by S15 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 applies).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The PAM subject on Marriage and Divorce has been amended to reflect these changes in legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 7.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the event that the advice contained in the Procedures Advice Manual is in fact incorrect, the definition of spouse in the Regulations be amended to include the requirement that a spouse is a person of Australian marriageable age.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendment to the Regulations is not necessary. The recent amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 simultaneously amended the Marriage Act 1961. As the Migration Act 1958 (sl2) recognises Part VA of the Marriage Act, any amendments to that part of the Marriage Act automatically apply to the Migration Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 8.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulations and PAM be amended to allow administrative flexibility in individual cases with respect to the degree of separation required for de facto, or married partners separated but not divorced, before the relationship is taken to be not continuing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted in principle. It is not necessary to amend the regulations to allow administrative flexibility in determining the degree of separation necessary before a relationship ceases to be continuing. Given that the guidelines for the assessment of the "genuine and continuing" criterion are provided for in instructional material, guidelines for determining the degree of separation can be similarly provided for.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For instance, items 8.3.1 to 8.3.3 of the PAM subject on Marriage and Divorce can be adapted and included in the PAM subject on De Facto Marriage Relationships as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A separation occurs where either of the parties to a de facto marriage forms the intention that the relationship is at an end and acts on that intention in a way which is inconsistent with the continuation of the relationship.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Separation usually occurs by one of the parties moving from common residence, although physical separation for work or other reasons does not necessarily mean that the parties have separated.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also possible for the parties to the de facto marriage to be separated while living at the same address. They would need to show that although they continued to live at the same address they had organised their lives quite separately and were not providing any support or domestic assistance to each other.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The visa and permit conditions included in regulations 17(1) and 28(1) be reworded so as to state the change in circumstances which would justify cancellation; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 10.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such circumstances to be limited to changes in the nature of the marriage or de facto relationship, such that the relationship is no longer genuine and continuing; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 11.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These circumstances not to include the death of a spouse or the breakdown in a relationship due to domestic violence or such other change which would not disqualify the spouse from obtaining permanent residence as a spouse; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 13.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Visa and permit holders to have explicit written notice of the full terms of conditions attaching to their visa or permit and of the consequences which result from breach of the conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted in principle. I agree there is a need for applicants to be aware of what constitutes a "material change in circumstances".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it is my view (supported by legal advice from my Department) that to prescribe these in the regulations is not the most appropriate course of action. The current wording of regulations 17(1)(o) and 28(1)(m) allows each to be used as conditions for any entry permit or visa. To amend these paragraphs to include spouse specific material would confine their use to the Spouse category.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Delegated officers are aware of what constitutes "material change" through the Department's instructional material. The applicant will be advised of the nature of the material change in initial information/advice letters sent to him/her after application. The letter(s) will include detailed information on all conditions attached to the entry permit (or visa as appropriate) and advice to the applicant of the consequences of breaching those conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A "material change" is a change that goes to the basis of the application. The basis of an application on marriage or de facto grounds is the relationship. A "material change" in this is, therefore, a change in the genuine and continuing nature of the marriage or de facto marriage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The condition that there be "no material change in circumstance" in regard to the relationship, is a mandatory condition. Breach of such a condition does not automatically lead to cancellation of the visa or entry permit&mdash;it is simply a ground for cancellation. Instructional material to delegated officers (PC 1771) reinforces this point, advising that officers have consideration for prescribed circumstances in which permanent residency may still be available before making any decision on cancellation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prescribed circumstances are where the applicant's Australian spouse dies, where the relationship breaks down due to domestic violence or where the relationship breaks down and there are access to children or maintenance of children considerations. These prescribed circumstances are part of phase two of the Spouse arrangements and regulatory changes to implement them will be made soon.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 12.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The requirements of natural justice to be observed before cancelling the spouse's visa or permit, the spouse to be given notice of the Minister's intention to cancel the visa or permit and time within which to respond to the allegations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted in principle. Delegated officers are bound to have regard to the principles of natural justice. Although the visa and temporary entry permit cancellation powers are couched in terms of my "absolute discretion", this does not mean that the principles of natural justice are excluded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The condition that there be "no material change in circumstance" in regard to the relationship, is a mandatory condition. Breach of such a condition does not automatically lead to cancellation of the visa or entry permit&mdash;it is simply a ground for cancellation. Instructional material to delegated officers (PC 1771) reinforces this point, advising that officers have consideration for prescribed circumstances in which permanent residence may still be granted before making any decision on cancellation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All applicants, except for those who did not hold a valid temporary entry permit when they applied (that is, they were illegal), will have an automatic right of review where their application has been rejected. Cancellation of an EETEP is not a reviewable decision, but the cancellation may require the outstanding application to be rejected and that decision is reviewable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where information is received that casts any doubt on the genuineness of the relationship, or where an interview causes the delegated officer to doubt the genuineness of the relationship, the applicant is given the chance and time to respond.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 14.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Extensions of the extended eligibility spouse entry permit be given sparingly and only to ensure that the applicant has lawful immigration status during processing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted. It was never my intention to use the Further Extended Eligibility Temporary Entry Permit (FEETEP) as a means of imposing the period of conditional residence beyond two years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The FEETEP was created as a mechanism to keep the applicant legal beyond the two year period where processing was taking longer than expected or where there were proceedings outside the control of the Department (ie. Family Court) that would impact upon the result of the application. This intention is reflected in current instructional material to delegated officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 15.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The test for a "genuine marriage", to be set out in the PAM, be as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">whether at the time at which the matter has to be decided it can be said that the parties have a mutual commitment to a shared life as husband and wife and that they have a genuine intention for their relationship to be ongoing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not the objective of the "genuine and continuing" criterion in Regulations 126 and 135 to test a genuine marriage. The genuineness of a marriage is established by its legal validity, its conformity to the provisions of the Marriage Act 1961. The objective of the "genuine and continuing" criterion in Regulations 126 and 135 is to assess the quality of the relationship, regardless of whether it is a de jure or a de facto relationship. The current guidelines for the assessment of the genuine and continuing nature of a marriage or de facto relationship provide an adequate test for the genuine and continuing nature of the relationship under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 16.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clear guidelines on the appropriate assessment dates, including the dates applicable for applications lodged before 15 April 1991, be written into the Procedures Advice Manual.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted. The procedural advice accompanying the new legislation clearly indicates the decision points for applications lodged after 15 April 1991. This information will be incorporated into the Procedures Advice Manual when next updated. The current Procedures Advice Manual gives guidelines for assessment points for those applications lodged before 15 April 1991.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs collect data on the incidence of sham marriage for immigration purposes and make that data available in its Annual Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Refer to the response to Recommendations 21, 22 and 23.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 18.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Procedures Advice Manual include information on particular common marriage customs, with the proviso that staff are advised not to assume that everyone of a particular cultural background adheres to those customs and that all cases are to be assessed on an individual basis; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 19.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Departmental officers are made aware of the community assessment of when the couple are married for the purpose of assessing the genuineness or otherwise of a traditional marriage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted in principle. The current guidelines for the assessment of the genuine and continuing nature of the marriage or de facto relationship provide that decision makers should consider the full circumstances of the relationship, having regard in particular to the factors highlighted in the guidelines. Such an approach is aimed at testing the genuineness of the relationship, rather than whether the relationship conforms to a particular cultural stereotype. Also, see the response to Recommendation 4 above.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should also be noted that the onus is on the applicant to establish that at the time of application he/she was the spouse of the nominating Australian citizen or permanent resident. Regulation 2 defines a spouse as a person who has entered into a marriage recognised as valid for the purposes of the Act, where the marriage has not been ended by divorce or the death of one of the parties and the parties are not living separately and apart on a permanent basis or a de facto spouse. The issue is, therefore, when the spousal relationship commences (a question of fact to be established by the applicant) and will thus be settled within the applicants cultural expectations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 20.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department move to tape all parallel interviews and that those tapes be made available to appropriate parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such statistical data be included in the Department's Annual Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted in part. Statistics on approval and rejection rates for applicants on marriage or de facto relationship grounds are collected. However not all refusals are on the basis of the relationship being contrived for the purpose of gaining permanent residence. Even if an application is rejected on the basis that the relationship is not genuine and continuing, this rejection will not necessarily prove that the relationship was contrived.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted in principle. However, deportation is an inherently complex matter. By virtue of the operation of s.14(2) and s.20 of the Migration Act 1958, a person may be an illegal entrant having made (or caused to be made) a statement which is false or misleading in a material particular. Applicants for permanent residence on spouse grounds who are party to bogus or sham marriages, who have made (or caused to be made) statements which are false and misleading in respect of the genuine and continuing nature of the marriage will be illegal entrants by virtue of ss.14(2) and 20 and be liable for deportation. This sanction is sufficient and two test cases in the Federal Court in 1991 upheld my Department's use of this legislation to remove from Australia spouses involved in contrived marriages.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs undertake a routine audit of former spouse applicants who have subsequently applied for citizenship in order to gather statistical data on marriage and detect those cases where there may be a report of sham marriage or marriage fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I question the value of such an audit for a variety of reasons but mainly because the fact that a relationship no longer exists if or when a permanent resident applies for citizenship is no indication that the relationship on which their grant of permanent residence was based was not genuine. Such statistical data would, therefore, be unreliable and of no obvious benefit to the residence sub program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 28.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A provision be incorporated into the Regulations to serve the same purpose as Section 204(a)(2a) of the United States Immigration Marriage Fraud Act, that is that the spouse applicant is not permitted to sponsor another spouse for a specified period unless it can be established by clear and convincing evidence that the prior marriage was not entered into for the purpose of evading any provision of the immigration laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted in principle. However, in my view it is not necessary to provide for penalties of this type, given the structure of the new spouse arrangements. The basic ground on which an application on the basis of a marriage or de facto relationship is approved is that the relationship in question is genuine and continuing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The assessment of the genuine and continuing nature of the relationship has regard to the full circumstances of the relationship. When an Australian citizen or permanent resident completes the form 887 nomination of a temporary resident on this ground, he/she is required to provide details of any previous nominations for grant of permanent residence. Clearly a nominator with a history of multiple nominations will raise questions in the mind of a decision maker as to the genuineness of the relationship. The information this question gathers serves the same purpose, without the 5 year prohibition, as the US provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The two year conditional residence period is a further significant disincentive to "serial" spouse nominators. I am also in the process of introducing a series of firm penalties for fraud pertaining to this category of application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 29.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There be a widespread and effective publicity campaign highlighting the increased surveillance and detection techniques, the increased penalties for fraud and the very real penalties of deportation and restrictions on re-entry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministerial press release 4/91 announcing the new spouse arrangements covered the range of penalties to be imposed on individuals involved in contriving marriages for the purpose of gaining permanent residence in Australia. The content of this press release attracted wide attention in the electronic and print media.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 30.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a marriage between an Australian and a non-Australian citizen has broken down and there has been a child of that marriage, that consideration be given to the rights and interests of the child at the time of the application for residence and prior to any deportation action by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 31.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where legal proceedings, including proceedings relating to divorce, settlement or custody, are under way, no action be taken by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs prior to the finalisation of such proceedings, providing there is not unreasonable delays in the pursuit of proceedings by the non-Australian party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted. The interests of the child(ren) are certainly an issue of consideration and are catered for in the second phase of the Spouse arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I announced in January of this year, the second phase will include provision for applicants to obtain permanent residence where:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the relationship has broken down and there are any children in the custody of the applicant who are subject to access for, or maintenance obligations on, the Australian spouse.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, where divorce, settlement or custody proceedings are under way and will establish which parent has day-to-day custody of the children, no decision on the case will be made until those proceedings are resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second phase instructional information to delegated officers includes advice that applications should not be finalised until custody proceedings (or proceedings affecting custody) are completed and the results of those proceedings taken into account. This information will include advice on processing where the applicant is unreasonably delaying such proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consideration will be given to amending the Regulations to provide for applicants to obtain permanent residence where the relationship has broken down and there are any children in the custody of the Australian citizen or permanent resident spouse in respect of whom the applicant has access rights. In the meantime, any such cases which arise may be dealt with under s115 and s137 of the Migration Act 1958. Of course, where custody of children is not an issue in divorce or settlement proceedings, delegated officers may continue to process or make a decision on a case.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations on change of status on grounds of marriage and de facto relationships dealt with a complex and certainly emotional subject. It involved myriad different sham marriage deals; the cultural differences in marriages of different cultures; what is and what is not a true de facto relationship; and, through all that, the lack of decent departmental statistics on the problems that the Committee reviewed. In other words, it was not a simple inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It became a complex report. Today we have received the Government's response to that report, which was presented on 17 May 1991. Therefore, some time has elapsed between the report being tabled and the Government's response today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I were asked the best way to describe the Government's response in a sentence, I would say that it had touches of realism and a large dose of half-heartedness. The Government has agreed to act on the recommendation that the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs must provide far better statistical data. This is not before time, for there seems little point in attempting to run a successful immigration program without the data to indicate what is and is not a problem. If a problem is to be analysed accurately so that its remedies can be considered, there needs to be a good statistical database upon which to make judgments. That is a good foundation for looking at the problem, reviewing it, making an assessment and proposing alternatives. For example, we do not know how many illegals we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has also agreed to establish training programs for officers in the marriage requirements of other cultures. We welcome that. We had a number of examples where officers in many different locations simply did not appreciate the different cultural attitudes to marriage and therefore were making judgments and decisions based on a lack of knowledge of those cultural differences. It is imperative that arranged marriages of many Asian cultures are not taken for sham marriages. Clearly, the basis of any good immigration program is fairness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are concerns that the Department is not willing to take action on the specific area of what is and what is not a de facto relationship, and inquire into whether a marriage is considered genuine&mdash;it has written these aspects off&mdash;whereas the Committee considered they were a vital component of the report. In other words, the Government is making perhaps more band-aid measures and appears unwilling to deal with some of the hard issues of the many couples who use the guise of a de facto relationship to gain the status of marriage and, as a result of that, entry and permanent citizenship in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not allow people to be able to jump the queue, in my view illegally. We should ensure that people overseas who have applied through the appropriate and right channels and undertaken the appropriate and right procedures as laid down by this Parliament, are given fair and equal treatment in relation to the regulations under the Migration Act, so that they are not put at a disadvantage and so that other people do not jump the queue by using a range of mechanisms, one of which is the subject we are talking about today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report contains 31 recommendations to which the Government has supplied us with a response. In the short time that the report has been available, it has been nigh on impossible to digest the Government's response in detail to those 31 recommendations. The way it is framed, with many of the Committee's recommendations given half answers or half refusals&mdash;that is, `accepted in principle, but', and then about four paragraphs of response to the `but'&mdash;it is going to be a matter of some time to digest and assess the Government's response to the recommendations. It will need greater assessment and, therefore, I seek leave to continue my remarks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The pig industry has become very important in most of Australia and, in fact, it is one of the rural industries that operates in every State. When we think of the traditional method of pig keeping of years ago and the sorts of animals they were, we can only give great credit to the industry for the magnificent progress it has made. The animal now is an entirely different shape and constituency than it used to be. The keeping of them is so different. The product, as I have said, is now totally different from what it used to be 30 or 40 years ago. This has been done by good research. The high density pig growing that is done now in various places is the result of treating the animals differently now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report covers a wide range of things that have happened over the years and the sort of research that is currently being done. It also covers the issue of dumping. I am pleased to say it has now been determined that for this particular year under review, the 1991 year, it was not  serious because the amount of imports was very low. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report takes quite a lot of trouble to go over the question of quarantine, particularly transmittable gastroenteritis and the importation of uncooked pig meat from Canada. The Government has to make up its mind on these subjects very soon. We hear officers of the quarantine service talking about `acceptable levels of risk'. They are not talking about an acceptable level of risk as far as the Government and the exporter are concerned, but they certainly are about the industry in Australia. If the Government determines that there is an acceptable level of risk, there can be no alternative to the fact that it must stand the risk. It is not reasonable that the Government should take actions contrary to what has been requested by the industry without being responsible. Whether the pig producers are in Tasmania, Queensland or wherever, this has to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that page 12 of the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To this end, Council submitted that it was the industry-wide view that the Government should&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, wish to speak to this Australian Pig Industry Policy Council Annual Report. In doing so, I want to say that I believe that there are two major issues of outstanding significance to the Australian pig industry at the moment. Both are related to the importation of quantities of Canadian pig meat which I notice is dealt with early in the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian pork producers are vitally concerned that the importation of subsidised Canadian pig meat is undercutting prices and introducing disease into our market. It is producing a situation which gravely threatens to undermine the financial viability of the industry. Earlier today colleagues would have heard Senator O'Chee point out that, in the last six months alone, $5.8m worth of Canadian pork has flooded into Australia. In light of this, it is fascinating to read on page 13 that the Council resolved that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">no action be taken at this time in respect of formally submitting a countervailing application because of the lack of significant imports and the lack of evidence of material injury during 1990-91.</PARA>
<PARA>However, it was sad to read that maybe no action will ever be taken when further on it reports:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While accepting the Governments view that the best recourse for the Australian pig industry was to seek protection from unfair trading practices via the existing Anti-Dumping and Countervailing legislation, Council considered at the time that the legislation and the interpretation thereof by the Australian Customs Service and the Anti-Dumping Authority combined to create a situation, which not only resulted in protracted and very costly cases, but in appearing to favour the exporting country over the importing country, indicated that the chances of a successful application were very remote.</PARA>
<PARA>Currently the quality of Australian pork is the highest in the world. We have no disease in it and we want to keep it that way. Only three countries have pork of comparable quality to Australia's&mdash;Denmark, New Zealand and Northern Ireland&mdash;and Australia is the clear leader. If we continue to import Canadian pig meat, it will be open slather on the Australian market. As far as this Government is concerned, there will be no health inspection except for document checks. It is the same as the strawberry industry. I think we all remember when Californian strawberries were imported, and they turned out to be riddled with disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Government had these concerns raised by pork producers right across the country, all that the Government said was that a limitation would be put on imports. A limitation of 17,000 tonnes was mentioned, but as far as many in the industry are concerned that figure was plucked from the air. That figure would represent imports of select cuts, but what it would really represent is a loss to Australian producers of much more than 17,000 tonnes of pig meat. Traditionally, a processor would have to buy a whole pig in order to obtain select cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a healthy and viable pig industry which should not be jeopardised by this sort of threat. Indeed, it is already bad enough on the land just trying to make ends meet in the current economic climate. Producers do not need to have their livelihoods threatened with the possibility of increased demand from inferior quality and disease ridden products from overseas. Indeed, Australia exports pork in limited quantities to New Zealand, Japan, the Pacific nations and the United States. However, the major problem the industry faces is that most other overseas pig-producing industries receive the benefit of government subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator O'Chee raised this issue during the matters of public interest discussion earlier. He drew the Senate's attention to the alarming fact that Qantas serves on its menu, printed for every overseas tourist to read, Canadian bacon. I want to know what is wrong with Australian bacon. It is bad enough that Qantas chooses to use it, but it is worse that it promotes it. Qantas is our national carrier and should be supporting our national industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, many other pork-producing nations subsidise their industries. We have seen the situation where the Danes, for example, were landing legs of pork in Singapore for a cheaper price than we could produce pigs here. Even though the United States has proven the Canadian product to be subsidised, the Australian Government chooses to ignore this. Senator Archer told us a little about diseases that pig meat could suffer. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>The Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account is a very important document which details the various mining royalty equivalents that are paid into the account each year. I note that in the financial year under consideration it is in the order of $33m. The report addresses the manner in which disbursements are made from that trust account. Some 40 per cent of the annual allocation is made available to the land councils for their administrative purposes, and then there are various other  distributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I address two points. I note that for the first time for a number of years no grants have been made under section 64(7) which, in effect, are the Minister's discretionary grants for additional administrative costs of the land councils. It is pleasing to note that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) has not under this report made those additional grants which for many years his predecessor, the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, made from this account direct to the land councils. Under Minister Hand those disbursements were many, many millions of dollars which went in administrative services and not in direct assistance or grants to Aboriginal organisations or for the benefit of Aboriginal people. The disbursements for administration are still very high&mdash;$14m in this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, an issue about the report that concerns me relates to applications for grant approvals, particularly as they relate to the purchase of pastoral properties. In various tables attached to the report I note significant numbers of applications. The number of applications and from where received are fully detailed on page 8. Only a very small number subsequently eventuated into approved applications for grant funding. They are detailed on page 9. The most significant area that is detailed is that $17m of a total grant funding approval of $20m is for the purchase of pastoral properties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report clearly states that in this financial year settlement took place in respect of only one of the four stations acquired, set out on page 10. Fitzroy Station was financed for $2.6m, Muckaty Station for $730,000, Elsey Station for $4.8m and Mistake Creek Station for just over $5m, yet the only settlement was with regard to the $730,000 grant approval for Muckaty. Therefore, some $12m has been transferred into the next financial year for the purchase of the other three Aboriginal pastoral properties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such significant grants from this trust account need to be read alongside the other moneys that are made available through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission for the purchase of pastoral properties elsewhere. The land councils have access out of other trust accounts. I have no objection to Aboriginal people owning, running and operating pastoral properties. However, the long term operation and viability of a pastoral property depend on the continuing management plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although this report acknowledges further action must be taken by the land councils in conjunction with ATSIC, I want to see that provision in the forward estimates of ATSIC; I shall be pursuing a number of questions when we get to the Estimates Committee. I want to know what provision the Government has made to ensure that these projects are viable and not just land purchases that cannot be adequately serviced and properly conducted on behalf of the Aboriginal owners. </PARA>

<PARA>I have not noticed any reports having yet been tabled for the Northern or Central Land Councils, and I hope that they will be forthcoming in the near future. The Tiwi Land Council is based on Melville and Bathurst Islands to the north of Darwin. It is an important land council and has attracted the commendation and praise of a number of senators for a number of years because of the competent manner in which it conducts its activities. This report goes a long way in setting out the success of the various business enterprises and community activities that are conducted on behalf of the Tiwi people on both Melville and Bathurst Islands. I commend the report to all senators as illustrating success stories on the manner of conducting Aboriginal businesses and community lifestyles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Together with Senator Michael Baume in his shadow ministry capacity relating to heritage matters and Senator Jocelyn Newman with her shadow portfolio responsibilities relating to women, I visited Melville and Bathurst Islands during the last year. We were very pleased at the response of the people we met and the courtesies that were extended to us by members of the Tiwi Land Council in explaining their various activities. Obviously they have been very successful, whether in pearling, tourism, fishing, arts and crafts or in the provision of many services on behalf of the people of the Tiwi islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to highlight some of the comments in the report relating to the mineral exploration projects by Renison Goldfields Consolidated to explore for heavy minerals along the northern coast of Bathurst and Melville Islands. The report draws our attention to those plans for mineral explorations and where they are proceeding. I am aware that since the end of the financial year under consideration in the report the Tiwi Land Council has endorsed and written up agreements with Renison which have been approved and endorsed by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, and by the Northern Territory Minister for Mines and Energy, Barry Coulter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important future long term initiative. When these projects are up and running successfully, there will be employment, investment opportunities and a considerable cash flow. Any major project development always seems to draw the immediate reaction of the radical environmental movements and similar people. This project is now engendering, as have so many other projects on Aboriginal land, controversy in the media. From reading this report and from the discussions I have had with executives of the Tiwi Land Council and the residents of both Melville Island and Bathurst Island, I do not believe it is of the major concern that has been purported and reported in the media. </PARA>

<PARA>I wish to speak briefly to this very important document. In fact, there are two documents: the final report of the evaluation of the child support scheme and the final report with the evidence in support of it, the survey report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 is on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> today. Most of us who are interested in this topic were anxious to have this report before we spoke on the Bill. None of us has had an opportunity, in the time available, adequately to read Justice Fogarty's report. The report is large and I hope that people take notice of it and not use it merely as a doorstop&mdash;for which it would be quite suitable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My remarks relate to the very important report by the Australian Education Council Review Committee headed by Mr T.B. Finn entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Young People's Participation in Post-Compulsory Education and Training</EMPHASIS>. At the outset, the Committee notes that there is an urgent need for change in the perception of education in this country. We need to recognise that at present our education system is not addressing the real issues in education today; that is, how to produce the multi-skilled, creative and adaptive work force that is necessary for Australia to progress towards the twenty-first century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">International comparisons show that it is vital in our future that we overcome our thinking of education and training as separate concepts in order to achieve this multi-skilling. For many years Germany has given technical education a higher status, particularly emphasising the service sector as opposed to the more traditional trades. This has contributed to the strength of the German economy and made its work force one of the most efficient and productive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to achieve this objective of both a general and vocational education for young people in Australia, both schools in general and the TAFE colleges in particular will have to change the what, the how and the why of what they teach. Schools will have to become concerned with issues of broad future employment prospects and the provision of broad vocational education. TAFE colleges will have to recognise that vocational courses must be more concerned with generalised competencies than the traditional craft-based apprenticeship courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report proposes an entirely different future for young people. It proposes that all young people should undergo sufficient post-compulsory education and training to complete year 12 or some equivalent post-secondary qualification and that at least half should go on to higher levels of education. The report has a very clear set of guidelines to achieve this target. All young people would be guaranteed a place in school or TAFE institutions after year 10 for two years of full time education or three years part time. Next, consideration is given to the essential studies required by all young people in preparation for employment. These key competencies include a range of skills, including not only the traditional disciplines but also cultural, interpersonal and problem solving skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry is crying out for a more efficient, skilled and knowledgeable work force that will maintain and enhance productivity in the workplace. Young people today are becoming more and more disillusioned with the education system. The relevance of Australia's education system and its ability to satisfy the requirements for the future of this country is addressed in this report and its findings should be very carefully considered by the Senate. Implementation of the report's recommendations will ensure that, whatever educational training is being undertaken, young people will develop these key competencies. Speed and urgency are needed for the implementation of these changes to our education system. It is through our education system that we produce an efficient multi-skilled work force that can lead Australia into the future with a more competitive economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also addressed in this report is the issue of how to fund these changes to the education system. Unless the issue of funding is properly addressed, 100,000 students will continue to be turned away from TAFE colleges. This is yet another report which urgently recommends that the Government rethink the funding procedures for TAFE so that the sector can expand rapidly. The Committee gives the Government of this country a clear choice&mdash;educate or perish: ensure the proper education of our young people or let this country slip even further behind the rest of the world in it's people's quality and quantity of knowledge and skills provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend this report to the Senate, but I especially recommend that the Government begin to take some positive action in implementing the findings of this and other important educational reports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is considering yet another very valuable report produced by the Industry Commission&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Export of Educational Services</EMPHASIS>. The area has already been considered very carefully by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training in its own inquiry into education exports. This examination played a very important part in achieving a large number of amendments to an extremely sloppy piece of legislation which the Government attempted to steamroll through the Parliament last year. It is not ideal, even in its current form, but it is, fortunately, vastly improved because of the result of Senate scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation and this Industry Commission report are a response by the Government to a rapidly growing export market. The number of international students coming to Australia has grown rapidly since 1986. That was the time when public institutions were first permitted to enrol foreign students and to charge fees. Student arrivals more than doubled between 1986 and 1989. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government regulation of this industry since its beginning in 1986 has been characterised by sudden shifts in policy direction, the effects of which have been made more serious by the way in which decisions were reached and subsequently communicated to those directly affected, in Australia and overseas.</PARA>
<PARA>The result of these simplistic knee-jerk reactions by the Government to complex problems has been a significant loss to Australia of large parts of its export education industry as the number of students coming to Australia for English language intensive courses and other short courses fell significantly because of tightened procedures. For instance, there was a dramatic reduction in the number of students from China from 22,000 in 1989 to less than 1,200 in 1990. Under the priority entry requirements, about 5 per cent of applications from China have been rejected, but the rejection rate increased to 95 per cent during 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every effort must now be made to restore our education export industry. There has been an alarming number of closures of private colleges which have previously offered English and business courses for students from overseas. This is extremely damaging to our reputation as an exporter of educational services and is seriously affecting the number of bona fide students coming to Australia to study. Five English language colleges collapsed in Sydney last year, leaving overseas students who had paid their fees in advance without funds and without the means to finish their courses. Last year a private college in Canberra also closed down when staff and students were locked out as a result of the owners failing to pay the rent. Students had already paid their fees for their courses, but they had no prospect of completing the courses or obtaining any qualifications. In this instance, the University of Canberra, fortunately, was able to accommodate all the students without additional cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the export industry is of cultural and economic importance to Australia. It is important to the international students and it is important to our educational institutions. For some institutions, overseas students have become a significant revenue source. Increased financial returns from education exports can advantage the domestic economy and it can improve the facilities and staff student ratios in institutions. Development of education as an export industry also brings less tangible benefits from the links established with people in geographical regions closest to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report itemises the benefits of overseas students to Australia. As in the case of all exports, there are benefits to the balance of payments and, given the present economic situation in Australia, every effort needs to be made to increase exports and remove obstacles which discourage students from seeking educational services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission notes that many benefits from education exports occur when students return home. The education export industry is valuable, it is important and it must stay. I commend this report to the Senate and I recommend vigilance by the Senate to prevent the uncertainty and embarrassment which result from the closure of colleges experiencing financial difficulties and inappropriate responses such as those attempted by this Labor Government in recent times. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address the annual report for the Department of Defence for 1990-91. With the recent rapid changes in world affairs, Australia's regional security climate has never been better, notwithstanding that much movement is needed on confidence building, force reduction, economic cooperation, human rights and environment protection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is surely self-evident that these developments should have a profound effect on Australia's defence doctrine. Yet the impression gained from this report is that it is business as usual. One exception, which is in tune with our times, is Australia's contribution to the United Nations peacekeeping operation in Cambodia. I commend those now serving in the force, and others yet to join them, for their valuable contribution to regional security and human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in most respects, the report looks embarrassingly out of date. We read that the Australian Defence Force promotes `strategic stability and security in our region'. Australian diplomacy surely plays a far more important role, yet the huge imbalance in resources&mdash;under which the foreign affairs budget is 5 per cent of the defence vote&mdash;is not even questioned. Our security depends much more on economic vitality than military strength, yet huge sums are being poured into increasingly irrelevant capital projects&mdash;$4.6 billion for new submarines and $4.3 billion for the Anzac frigates&mdash;when our national infrastructure remains run down and under-funded. A dollar invested in upgrading our rail network to fast freight train status would create far more jobs than investing the same dollar in submarine construction, thus strengthening another pillar of our national security&mdash;social cohesion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Repairing the gaping holes in our coastal surveillance and interception system should be a far higher priority in defence activities. Yet the report states that, in 1991-92, our P-3C Orions will spend less than half the time spent on coastal surveillance in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have repeatedly called for a total rethink of Australia's defence. I note from the Defence Industry &amp; Aerospace Report of 31 January that the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) is predisposed to commission another defence White Paper. He should do so urgently, and with comprehensive public involvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to raise a specific matter in the report, namely the proposed relocation of Newington armament depot from Sydney to Jervis Bay. The long awaited review of alternative sites to Jervis Bay mentioned in the report remains under wraps, despite Senator Richardson's earlier commitment to release it. I understand that the Minister has no intention of honouring that commitment. This cynicism is compounded by an outrageous piece of Navy disinformation aimed at winning local acceptance of the move. It is a colour map on which the Jervis Bay ammunitioning pipeline is depicted as an innocuous 15 kilometre journey between the proposed depot and the wharf&mdash;conveniently omitting the 200 kilometre section between Jervis Bay and the Kingswood armament depot in Penrith, over which 450 truckloads of high explosive missiles and torpedoes would be shipped each year over busy highways and through numerous towns, against the opposition of several local councils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue has dragged on for far too long. It is about time that the Government put the issue to rest by abandoning the relocation and creating a marine and terrestrial national park. This would not only protect a marvellous natural area but would also save the taxpayer $200m, without any loss of defence readiness. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In October last year, the Senate agreed to a package of fisheries legislation after a major review by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and many&mdash;80&mdash;amendments. The new legislation came in response to what can only be described as a disastrous record of Commonwealth fisheries management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the many misgivings expressed about the adequacy of the legislation to improve matters, the Minister agreed that the legislation be referred to the Committee again in a year; that is, in October of this year. By then, AFMA&mdash;that is, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority&mdash;would be up and running and we would be able to assess the legal framework about which there was much controversy. We would also have the benefit of the Industry Commission's final report on cost recovery for fisheries management. This report is before us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the state of Australian fisheries. We are all used to the dismal science of the economists at the Industry Commission but the picture painted by this report is more dismal than usual. Most Commonwealth fisheries are over-fished, some to the point of total collapse&mdash;for example, the Bass Strait scallops. Others are getting close. The gemfish population has been so depleted that there is real concern as to whether it will recover. The southern shark fishery, the source of flake, is threatened with closure or, at a minimum, drastic reductions in catches until it recovers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all aware of the problems in the south-east trawl fishery, where again huge reductions in catches are necessary. But the report says that it will take an extra $21m in research over the next five years to work out what sustainable catches should be for all the major species involved. Of all the major Commonwealth fisheries, only the northern banana resource is in good shape. It is some consolation, I suppose, to know that our two most valuable export fisheries&mdash;prawns and lobsters&mdash;are the most robust. The report gives the credit for this to the integration of research and management, putting management of the resource before management of the fishing industry, and close communication and trust between the fishing industry, researchers and managers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But even in these fisheries, there is substantial over-capacity in the fishing industry. The problem of too many fishermen chasing too few fish is even bigger for those fisheries where catches are plummeting. This problem has actually been exacerbated by inept Commonwealth management in the past. This has spilled over to State managed fisheries as well. Recently, fishermen have been adjusting out of the northern prawn and south-east trawl fisheries into adjacent State fisheries, where the level of effort was already excessive. The result is that fisheries resources throughout the AFZ are being hammered to death, regardless of political boundaries. Urgent reform of Commonwealth-State roles is imperative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report highlights the folly of Commonwealth-State jurisdictional divisions within marine ecosystems. I agree with the Commission that urgent action is required by the Commonwealth and the States to rationalise management to ensure that a single agency manages a fishery. Unless this parochialism is overcome, the alternative will be to teach the fish to read the lines painted on the water, but I am afraid there will not be any fish left to teach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The poor results of past management are made even worse by their high cost. In 1990-91 about $28m was spent by all agencies involved in the management of Commonwealth fisheries. About $15m of this was for research, and about $8m for regulations, administration, licensing and surveillance of the fishing industry. Another $1m or so was spent on management of the commercial fishing industry itself for things like restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this report is a good report and it goes to the question of good management, not only in terms of the ability of people to catch the fish but also to look after the marine resources as a total resource. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also want to speak to the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service annual report of 1990-91. The report describes the role of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, which includes policy development and planning. The One Nation statement is relevant in this regard because it states new policy concerning the integration of economic and environmental considerations in the process of establishing national parks. The One Nation statement says that `when considering proposals to establish new national parks or marine parks and reserves, and where such action would constrain future access to resources within them, a prior assessment of the economic values and potential of the area will be routinely carried out'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats totally reject such an approach for reasons which have also been stated clearly as the view of conservation groups at page 146 of the report of the Ecologically Sustainable Development&mdash;Mining Working Group. That view is that it is inappropriate to engage in a trade-off between economic and ecological values because, firstly, there is an increasing scarcity of relatively unmodified, natural ecosystems in Australia; secondly, there are always environmental risks associated with resource surveys; thirdly, that if circumstances arise where a protected area contains the only remaining accessible mineral resource, then fundamental questions need to be asked about the sustainability of a society which has, in less than 200 years, driven us to that situation; and finally, the same minerals can often be found and exploited elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minerals exploitation and mining is prohibited in less than 2 1/2 per cent of this country. Exploration and mining should occur, therefore, only in those areas where the conservation values are not sufficiently high to require protection in national parks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also describes the activities carried out under the endangered species program. This program is severely restricted in scope. Mr Kelly's endangered species legislation relates to less than one per cent of the Australian land mass. Indeed, we still have not seen that legislation. As an island continent, Australia's ecosystems and biodiversity need to be managed as a whole. In relation to endangered species, this can best be achieved by the Commonwealth having overriding powers in regard to protection measures for endangered species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter which is discussed in this report which I wish to raise relates to the Australian biological resources study. ABRS identifies what kinds of plants and animals there are in Australia and where these plants and animals can be found. It has been estimated that, because of the very paltry funding that ABRS receives, at present rates the ABRS will not complete its task of identifying the animals and plants, their relationships and where they are found until the year 3000. By that time, at the rate we are going, most of them will no longer exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is critical to the management of our natural environment that we know what is there and how these species interact. It is important that we discover these things as quickly as possible. The ABRS must therefore be expanded. It must incorporate a program to survey the type and location of all major Australian flora and fauna; incorporate a national land capability assessment program of the Australian continent, Australian ocean, fisheries and all territories; and establish an environmental resource library that provides access to data and modelling capabilities to interested non-government organisations on the same principle as a public library. We believe, therefore, that funding for the ABRS should be substantially upgraded to at least $24m per year. </PARA>

<PARA>I congratulate the Honeybee and Research Development Council on its annual report for 1991 and for the work it does in helping to increase and promote the honey and beekeeping industries in Australia. I believe that this is a very important matter because in the year 1991 the honey industry, like so many others, experienced many challenges and changes. Indeed, the Chairman of the Council noted in the report that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Like many other rural industries, the honey industry has experienced challenges to its viability, ranging from resource security through to a sensible price for honey and other bee products on the domestic and international markets.</PARA>
<PARA>These challenges include not only the domestic and international environment, but also the legislative changes made by the Government. On page 3 of the report, the Chairman noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council is in discussion with the industry over the ramifications of the decision by Mr Kerin (when he was Minister for Primary Industry) to terminate the Australian Honey Board.</PARA>
<PARA>Further reading of this report identifies that the key to successful beekeeping is effective hive and business management. However, the degree of success varies significantly as there is a wide range in the yield per hive which apiarists achieve within the same area. This difference indicates that there are benefits to be gained from extension which promotes more efficient beekeeping practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note on page 16 of the report that one means by which the Council is promoting more efficient beekeeping practices is by recording and disseminating the sound beekeeping practices of successful beekeepers. This has been brought about by the recognition that many successful beekeepers throughout Australia have acquired a wealth of knowledge and understanding of beekeeping practices that lead to profitable enterprise. With the retirement of some of the older beekeepers, there is considerable danger that much of this valuable information will be lost unless it is documented. The Council believes that efforts should be made to capture this knowledge for the benefit of other beekeepers who are presently in the industry and for the benefit of those who enter the profession in years to come. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the risk of seeming to speak too much in the Senate this afternoon, I wish to speak to the motion concerning the Family Court of Australia annual report 1990-91. The Family Court of Australia exists because, increasingly, Australian men and women do not hesitate to tear up marital commitments, to shirk marital obligations and to abuse their former spouses and, in particular, their children either by neglect or by physical abuse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation is best illustrated when we read that approximately one marriage in three ends in divorce and that each year there are 2.5 divorces for every 1,000 people. Each year, the Family Court deals with over 100,000 adult litigants, more than 150,000 children and many more people who are involved without being litigants. No other court has anything like this volume of business or contact with the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 23 of the report, we read that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A total of 42,635 divorces were granted by the Family Courts of Australia and Western Australia in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>The report also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That figure represents a 3 per cent increase over 1989 and a rate of 2.5 divorces per 1,000 persons.</PARA>
<PARA>It is 16 years since the Family Law Act came onto the Australian legal landscape. Divorce is a dreadfully sad thing, but what we have to remember is that when there is a divorce it represents the breakdown of another family unit. Ultimately, the health of society depends on the stability, well-being and harmonious functioning of the family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was once said that civilisation can be lost in a single generation if the value systems are not preserved and passed on through the family. The Family Law Act in its entirety has led to a disintegration of many of those value systems. It was one of the most discriminatory, ill-considered and badly drafted Bills to be ever introduced into the Australian Parliament. It discriminated against those who do not want their marriages to be dissolved at the whim of the other party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact of life that in marriage the longer it lasts, the woman's independence and her main economic ability to fend for herself become less. Women are not given the protection and support to which they are entitled as wives and mothers of the future generations of Australians. It takes away from women security and legal safeguards and, in the guise of enabling marriages to be dissolved with dignity, enables all marriages to be dissolved on the unilateral decision of either party on short notice. In other words, it reduces marriage to a purely temporary union with little or no protection for women and children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It turns marriage into a cheap, temporary union which may be dissolved on the unilateral decision of one party. It creates a climate which leads to a light-hearted approach to marriage. Frank Stewart, who was a Minister in the Whitlam Government at the time the legislation was introduced, was a fierce opponent of it. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the cloak of removing injustice, humiliation and indignity from divorce, new injustices, new humiliations and new indignities are created.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What could be more humiliating, more unjust, or cause greater distress and hurt to a spouse than to be abandoned without cause by his or her partner merely at the whim of such partner as a matter of convenience on 12 months notice?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not divorce because the marriage has irretrievably or otherwise broken down; it is the destruction of marriage by abandonment.</PARA>
<PARA>Another speaker, Kevin Cairns, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The powerhouse clauses (of the Act). . . concern the nature of the marriage itself, and make it clear that the package no fault is not a package that has any truth; that the so-called relegation of indignity and bitterness is not relegated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All that is done is that it is swept under the carpet and allowed to fester in the hearts, minds, activities and feelings of those who have been wronged, which in most cases is the dependent partner in a marriage. It certainly is not a Bill which has anything to do with the rights or equality of women in that situation.</PARA>
<PARA>Many honourable senators would be aware of the high number of constituents who have come to them with complaints. Let us ask ourselves: what have been the social and economic consequences for the community of this Act? As I said earlier, it has been an increase in the number of divorces in the community. That is one of the problems. Children have suffered the psychological damage of family collapse, the loss of security, torn affections and both emotional and material disturbance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Briefly, dealing with the chronology of the matters in Western Australia, it is worth noting that the Western Australian Government was advised in November 1991 that the then senator Jo Vallentine would resign on 31 January 1992 and that the Greens in Western Australia had nominated Christabel Chamarette as her replacement.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a principle of the Constitution that the representation of States in the Senate should be maintained, as far as possible, with unbroken continuity, and that no State should be, for any time longer than absolutely necessary, short in its representation and consequently deficient in its political strength in the Council of States.</PARA>
<PARA>That really only needs to be put into the record again because I wholeheartedly agree with those sentiments. In the same debate, Senator Murphy supported the concern being expressed at the lack of alacrity, or the slowness, with which the New South Wales Government had discharged its responsibility in filling the vacancy. He said, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is extremely dangerous that a place should be left unfilled. It is obvious that if it were to be accepted that a place could be left unfilled, it might be suggested that this was being done for improper motives. It could be suggested that a State was being deprived of its true representation so that a party political advantage could be achieved. That would be an abuse of the Constitution. So I entirely agree with what has been said.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, he agreed with what had been said by Senator Greenwood. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">May I also say that from the expressions I hear around me this would appear to be the opinion of the whole Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Byrne said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I agree that this is a very serious intrusion into the functioning of federal government and, at the extremity, could completely frustrate it.</PARA>
<PARA>That seems to me to sum up the matter. Here we have an opportunity by the Western Australian Government to fill this casual vacancy; the opportunity was there and it was not taken. That has indeed frustrated the proper functioning of this Senate in that the people of Western Australia have not had representation from somebody who at the relevant time&mdash;at the election&mdash;was elected a member of the Greens to represent one part of that electorate in this place. Accordingly, everybody in this chamber should agree with the motion as I have now amended it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate disapproves of the action of the Western Australian Government for failing to appoint Christabel Chamarette&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the properly and duly nominated person by her Party&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Western Australian Government received legal advice from the Solicitor-General that it would be improper for the Governor-General in Council to appoint a replacement senator for Western Australia. The State Government decided to act in accordance with that advice. It is true that there was a one-day sitting of the State Parliament. That was a sitting called for a special purpose; it was not the joint sitting which is required for the purpose of replacing a senator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if people think that Western Australia is being unjustly or unnecessarily deprived of its full Senate representation in the Federal Parliament, the finger should be pointed not at the State Government but at Senator Vallentine, who resigned her position on 31 January. As she left the Senate, she gave three reasons, one of which was ill health. No doubt she was tired, having travelled incessantly around the country delivering sanctimonious sermons on the professional protest circuit and seeing how often she could get herself arrested within range of a television camera. People do not usually give six months notice of health enforced retirement, as Senator Vallentine did, let alone forecast the precise day on which their health would deteriorate to the point where there was no option other than retirement, even though she had still been playing on the protest circuit a week or two before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason Senator Vallentine gave was a desire to spend more time with her family&mdash;a common enough desire but not highly developed enough in March of 1990, less than two years before her retirement, when she sought re-election to the Senate. The third reason&mdash;and we are getting into the nitty-gritty here&mdash;was that she retired, to use her own words, `in accordance with the Green principle of rotating jobs'. For four years, Senator Vallentine&mdash;ex-Country Party, ex-Nuclear Disarmament Party, ex-Independent&mdash;sat in the Senate as a Western Australian Green senator. She preached the abstemious Green doctrine of self-denial and forgone consumption, lower real incomes and lower levels of material consumption. She then, with breathtaking hypocrisy, tried to pull the big financial scam to convert the $85,000 lump sum superannuation payment&mdash;to which she was, by the relevant Act of Parliament, entitled&mdash;into a $165,000 lump sum payment, plus a lifetime indexed pension of $16,500. I think the hypocrisy of that is so great that I do not really need to say any more about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I make one related observation. More than 30.4 per cent of the Green candidates in the recent Tasmanian election were school teachers, who therefore, as Greens, preach the same doctrine of self-denial, forgone material consumption and so on. I have not noticed any resistance within the teachers union to the demands for continuing increases in teachers' real incomes. While they preach the doctrine of self-denial in public fora and in the Parliament, they obviously do not preach it within the teachers union, otherwise some countervailing power would have developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Vallentine, having conformed, as she put it, to the Green principle of rotating jobs and having established the precedent of doing that, and trying to pull the big financial scam while she did it, poses two question for Senator-elect Chamarette when she finally takes her seat in the Parliament. Does she too subscribe to the Green principle of rotating jobs and, if so, will she after serving six years in the Parliament also resign and then follow the precedent established by Senator Vallentine of trying to pull the big financial scam?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the reasons that I have gone into already, Senator-elect Chamarette is not yet in the Senate. I hope as soon as she is here that she will make it very clear whether she intends to repeat what Senator Vallentine has done; that is, resign after six years&mdash;assuming she has not lost an election in the meantime&mdash;and then try to pull the same financial scam. I certainly look forward to hearing her tell us what she plans to do when she does take her seat. Of course, I will not be voting for this motion. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure that all of what Senator Walsh said should be supported. Senator Vallentine's spot should be filled quickly and I certainly hope that Senator-elect Chamarette makes a more reasoned, rational contribution to the chamber than at times we saw Senator Vallentine make. I came into this place late in the last sitting to listen to Senator Vallentine's valedictory speech for light entertainment. I did walk out because I thought it was such a rambling, raving contribution. It certainly showed that she had learnt very little in her time in this place, and perhaps it was a sign of the sickness that afflicted her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the issues that this motion raises is the history of replacing casual vacancies in the Senate and, as was referred to briefly by Senator Coulter, it has been politicised by both sides of politics in Australia's history. It is something that should not be politicised; it is something that brings the role of the Senate into sharp focus. That is an issue always close to my heart. No matter what happens in Australian politics, no matter what political observers say about the Senate, it should have a role in sticking up for States interests and States rights. It is no longer politically popular to talk about States rights, but we have seen here in Canberra in the past week a very good example of how honourable senators can make a difference for their State and their States interests. At the Labor Party's caucus meeting, none other than Senator Colston ensured that the Bill on daylight saving put forward by the honourable member for Stirling, Ronald Edwards, was defeated in the Caucus. </PARA>

If Western Australia does not have full representation in this place, it has been let down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the delay in installing Senator Vallentine's replacement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Solicitor-General's advice that Senator Walsh referred to is just that&mdash;advice. There are many examples of Governors making an appointment in council in order to fill casual vacancies and having it ratified by the parliament at a later date. But even if the Solicitor-General and the Premier are right in accepting that advice, there was no reason why, when the Western Australian Parliament got together for a two-day special sitting to debate the juvenile justice legislation, it could not have called the two Houses together for two or three minutes to confirm the nomination of Senator-elect Chamarette to represent Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate my sense of empathy with Senator Chamarette. I am sure that we will have very many differences on political matters when she actually makes it into this hallowed chamber.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Whenever Parliament has been informed by Message from His Excellency the Governor that the place of a Senator for the State of Western Australia has become vacant under section 15 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, a motion shall be made that the President and Speaker do fix a day and a place whereon and whereat the Council and Assembly, sitting and voting together, may choose a person to hold the place of the Senator whose place has become vacant as aforesaid. Such day shall be not be more than 14 days after the date of such motion.</PARA>

<PARA>It is the first part of that standing order that is of note. There has been publicity in Western Australia about the fact that the State Government knew well in advance when Senator Vallentine was going to retire&mdash;and I am not going to resile from that. Notice was given in September last year that Senator Vallentine was going to get a headache on 31 January and would not be able to continue in this place as a representative of the people of Western Australia. That is certainly on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the rules of the Parliament of Western Australia state that it is not the retiring senator who has to give notice. The senator gives notice to the Governor of the State, or the Governor of the State is informed, and then the machinery of the Western Australian legislature turns into action after the Governor advises the President of the Western Australian Legislative Council and the Speaker of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly. That could not happen until after Senator Vallentine had presented her resignation to the President of this place, Senator Sibraa. That happened on 31 January this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The machinery started, and I understand that notice was given by the Governor of Western Australia to the Parliamentary Officers in Western Australia in the first week in February.

Appointment was made by the Governor to fill the vacancy in each case. The Parliament was merely adjourned but not prorogued at the time the vacancy was notified. In 1952 and 1966 a joint sitting of the Parliament later purported to confirm the appointments, but in 1974 there was no joint sitting to confirm that appointment. However, no challenge was made to any of the three appointments. There is advice from the Solicitor-General in Western Australia that if the State Government had had to proceed with the appointment through Executive Council, it was open to legal challenge. Constitutional lawyers would be much better and much more able to address this point than I am. I understand Senator Walsh made some reference to the fact that the Western Australian Solicitor-General did make some comment on that. </PARA>

Without wishing to point the finger around the chamber, I note, as the record will show, that on every occasion a division occurred at that time there was always a pair from the Opposition side of the chamber to Senator Devereux. It was a State problem that kept John Devereux out of this chamber until the election in 1987. It was not as a result of anything that happened in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in my opening remarks, I do not think the Senate chamber has been all that disadvantaged on this occasion because the State of Western Australia is one representative short.

That should have been done in plenty of time to ensure that the State was in no way disadvantaged by the fact that at the moment we do not have our full quota of senators.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the motion moved by Senator Coulter that expresses disapproval of the action of the Western Australia Government for failing to appoint Christabel Chamarette as a senator for Western Australia and condemns the Western Australian Government for denying electors of that State their rightful representation in the Senate. I want to address that issue in my remarks. The Labor Government of Western Australia has shown no respect for the Senate and the Federal Parliament in its delay in appointing a twelfth senator from my State in succession to Senator Vallentine. As a convinced federalist, it is my firm belief that our system can endure only if there is mutual respect between the two different levels of government. I think that is where the State Government is failing at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are firm precedents for the appointment of senators to such casual vacancies by the State Governor in Council on occasions when State Parliaments are not sitting. I am aware that some of the cases have been referred to today by previous speakers. This is an essential practice, given the long recesses that occur at State level. It would have assisted had Senator McKiernan mentioned actual incidents and the way in which these replacements have taken place in the past. In Western Australia the Parliament does not normally sit between the first week in December and the middle of March. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bell's name was mentioned earlier. I point out that on 7 March 1990 Senator Bell was appointed by the Executive Council in Tasmania. More particularly, in Western Australia on 11 March 1981 former Senator Martyr was appointed by the Governor in succession to former Senator Rocher to represent the Liberal Party, and was confirmed when State Parliament met on 25 March. Therefore, I believe that the precedent is obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 16 January 1974 there is an even more telling precedent because, under the Tonkin Labor Government of Western Australia, Senator David Reid was appointed by the Governor on the resignation of Country Party Senator Prowse. Senator Reid was defeated at the May 1974 elections before State Parliament next met, but the Executive Council approved his appointment at that stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, former Senator Reg Withers was appointed by the Governor of Western Australia to succeed former Senator Sir Shane Paltridge on 17 February 1966, and that was not confirmed by the State Parliament until 9 August that year. That was a period from February to August, and it makes a mockery of statements to the effect that the Government has not had an opportunity to put senator-elect Chamarette into the Senate. I could quote further precedents, but the point has been squarely made that the Lawrence Labor Government has defied convention, and that is the sad part about the matter. Surely if that Government had been troubled by genuine legal doubt, the proper course would have been to make the appointment, as appointments have been made in the past, and deal with any challenge later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1977 there has been a very clear imperative for all State governments to honour the wishes of the electors of their State and to fill any Senate vacancy without delay. This was the effect of one of the few successful amendments to the Constitution in recent years, namely, section 15. That  move won overwhelming support from Australian electors, who insisted that Senate vacancies be filled by a nominee of the same party. Although that amendment was sponsored by the coalition Government, it had the fervent support of the ALP, whose members waxed indignant over the actions of the Askin and Bjelke-Petersen State governments in refusing to replace resigning and deceased Labor senators with Labor nominees. The fact that those members performed like trained seals at that time highlights the fact that they should come to grips with the situation and act according to the spirit of those amendments as well as the letter to ensure that they are carried out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The electors of Western Australia who voted for an independent Green in 1990 are fully entitled to continued representation. Every Western Australian, whoever we voted for, is entitled to be represented by 12 rather than 11 senators. It is a long bow for Senator McKiernan to draw in seeking to compare what Senator Vallentine did with what it is hoped senator-elect Chamarette will or will not be doing. It is sad that a State is being denied that representation purely based on the fact that Senator Vallentine was a poor attendee in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party, which is supposedly very sensitive to the rights of employees, should have some concern for the staff members who are waiting for their new employment, who have effectively been employed by Christabel Chamarette, who cannot be paid and, I understand, cannot be paid retrospectively either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Lawrence Labor Government can hardly claim to have been taken by surprise in this matter, as has been clearly outlined here today. Former Senator Vallentine announced her resignation in September and said that it would take effect on 31 January. I agree with Senator McKiernan that the Western Australian Government could not have taken any initiative in making a formal replacement until after that date, until the letter had been received by the President of the Senate, but that does not alter the fact that there is another course which can be taken and, on this occasion, should be taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I was certainly not impressed at the casual and leisurely pace of former Senator Vallentine's departure, particularly as health reasons were given, the point remains that the State Government knew precisely what the situation would be and when it would arise. In January the State Government decided to have a special sitting of Parliament in February. It could at least have said, `Here is an opportunity where we can agree to this and have a joint sitting', so that Senator-elect Chamarette could take her place here when the Senate resumed later that month. Seldom has a State government been given more notice of a Senate vacancy, and I think it should have acted accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The precedent that the Carmen Lawrence Labor Government has created not only is an insult to the Senate and the electors of Western Australia but also has very dangerous implications. The next time there is a Senate vacancy may well not be a time that is chosen by a retiring senator&mdash;it could be due to ill health, death or a number of other reasons. On that occasion, it may be politically convenient for a State government to leave a Federal Government or, in fact, a Federal Opposition short of a senator for as long as possible when contentious legislation is before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McKiernan mentioned the problem we had with respect to Senator Devereux. In that case, the Opposition extended a pair so that the balance in the Senate remained the same. On this occasion, particularly with an independent to whom pairs are not granted, that position does not apply. It shows that at a time when there may be highly contentious legislation before the Senate a State government could take the Lawrence Government lead and manipulate it to the point that it could have very serious implications for a government or an opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am sure that I would disagree profoundly with the views Christabel Chamarette may put forward&mdash;for example, with respect to the Forests Protection Bill&mdash;I consider it grossly wrong and unfair that her Party should be unrepresented in such a debate that has been scheduled for the Senate this week. Okay, it has not come up this week, but it was scheduled by the Government for debate this week. I believe that the State Government should not have denied Christabel Chamarette the right to put her position, and the position of the people whom she represents, in that debate. It is ironic that a prospective senator who may take a greater interest in the work of the Senate than did her predecessor&mdash;it is certainly hoped that she does&mdash;is denied her seat because of the actions of a State Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not, in any case, be surprised at the actions of Premier Lawrence and her Cabinet, who have to be dragged kicking and screaming into holding a royal commission; a Premier who, 12 months ago, tried to sabotage inconvenient select committees of her own upper House by artificially proroguing Parliament because they happened to have references before them which she disagreed with; a Government with a senior Minister now facing a contempt of court charge. Moreover, the Lawrence Government apparently doctored a Public Service Commission report into the relationship between a government agency and a failed financial group by removing the reference to a senior Minister's intervention on its behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government is not clean; it is not lily white, pure and with nothing to hide. This Government had to be pushed into every action about all of the grubby little deals that it has done, yet here it is now trying to take the high moral road and saying, `We have to approve Senator-elect Chamarette to come to the Federal Senate'. That is not so. It can be done; it has been done. Why is it not being done on this occasion? The improprieties of a scandal-ridden Labor Government are a matter of shame for the people of Western Australia. Now this habitual impropriety has spilled over to an insult to the Senate, a denial of representation to all Western Australians, injustice to certain individuals and a sinister precedent in defiance of the Constitution. I think this motion deserves support for the variety of reasons that I have outlined to the Senate this afternoon. </PARA>

In my mind there is a clear distinction between a State government which ultimately has the right in respect of an appointment, which chooses not to make a certain appointment, and a State government which simply delays the appointment. One is an overt deliberate act, in the sense of making a determination in respect of candidates, and the other is in many respects more Machiavellian and political.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think any step from here into the other chamber is inevitably bound to lead downhill. Senator Campbell was preselected by the Liberal Party, in all its wisdom, on 30 April 1990. The State Parliament of Western Australia met between 1 May and 17 May. During that period, it failed the test of competence and integrity. During that time it failed to have a joint sitting, a process which takes but five minutes. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>Whether that was incompetence, Machiavellian politics or just pure corruption, I do not know. Ultimately, it had the effect of denying Senator Campbell the opportunity to represent the Liberal Party and Western Australia in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have the circumstance where Senator Vallentine resigned from the Senate on 31 January having notified the Western Australian Government and the Premier of that State on 1 November of her intention to do so, as I understand it. Thirty-four days after her official formal resignation, Ms Chamarette has not yet been sworn in. It is not as if the State Government has not been meeting. The Parliament of Western Australia met on both 5 and 6 February. It met for political reasons, granted, but it was consequential enough for Premier Carmen Lawrence to come scurrying back from Italy to Perth. It seems to me that that would have been an ideal and practical opportunity to have addressed the matter of the appointment of Ms Chamarette. However, it seemed that the Government was more interested in locking up 14-year-old Aboriginal children&mdash;children who had not yet reached the period of wisdom and knowledge&mdash;than it was in appointing a representative of that State to this chamber. There seems to be no reason that I can detect why that appointment could not have been made on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to political stunts, political grandstanding, political populism and the hard reality of politics, the State Labor Government can very quickly call the Parliament together for the purpose it chooses. On that occasion it considered one piece of legislation that was so serious that it brought back various members of parliament from their junkets around the world. Having done that, it did not have the commonsense or the decency or the integrity to make the appointment it should have made at that time. It took no more than a rally, an uprising from the people of Western Australia about the abysmal record of that Government in law and order for the Government to decide overnight that the legislation was a matter of urgency and that it would recall the Parliament to jam through legislation designed to placate the vocal members of the Western Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Knowles made the point that there is a clear distinction between denying a voice to an independent and denying a voice to a member of a major political party. The Labor Government of Western Australia is denying all Western Australians a voice in this chamber. More particularly, I remind the Senate that there were 14,521 first votes&mdash;that is not very many in a Senate election&mdash;for Senator Vallentine. In other words, 14,521 people put their No. 1 vote alongside Senator Vallentine's name. It was their intention that she be their representative. In total votes, the Greens in Western Australian attracted 60,923 votes&mdash;6.7 per cent of the vote. That group of people whose intention it was to be represented by Senator Vallentine, whatever shade of politics she was embracing at that time&mdash;whether it be anti-nuclear, Greens or whatever&mdash;chose her as their duly elected representative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Constitution provides that in the event that there is a vacancy created by the departure of a senator such as Senator Vallentine, those people shall be represented in this chamber by a person selected by her political party. Those people are being denied representation in the Federal Parliament. In the case of independents, it is a greater aberration than if the senator happens to be from either the Labor Party or the Liberal Party because there are others there who can articulate and express and represent the point of view of the people of Western Australia. There is no substitute voice in this chamber for the Green party. There is no member of the House of Representatives who can express the point of view that Ms Chamarette will no doubt expound when she is sworn into this chamber in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is intrinsic about Ms Chamarette's appointment and election to this chamber is that the Senate is meant to be the House of second deliberation. More particularly, it is meant to be the States' house, with equal representation. The purpose of equal representation was deliberately designed to ensure that the less populous States such as Western Australia had the same voice as New South Wales and Victoria. To the extent that there is one vacancy in this chamber at present, the people of Western Australia are being denied that voice. The point has been made that it is not possible to create a pair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding is that Senator Vallentine contacted the Premier and deliberately chose 31 January as her date of resignation to ensure ample time for the Parliament of Western Australia to swear in her replacement. She was given an undertaking that the timing would be such that it would assume that Ms Chamarette would be sworn in for the beginning of that session. In fact, the correspondence I have seen confirms that. Senator Vallentine was informally told on the telephone that it was a five-minute exercise, a formality, and there would be no problem. That was not to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether this problem is the result of the bumbling incompetence of the Labor Government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Collins has pointed out, this is not the first time such an issue has come before the Senate. In fact, to my knowledge this issue has been floating around for 20 or 30 years. I refer to the situation of different State governments getting different legal opinions as to their entitlement. We have seen two practices, of course, in the replacement of senators. The first one, and the most normal one, is where a combined meeting&mdash;if the State has two houses&mdash;chooses a candidate. That is very inconvenient when a candidate resigns and the State parliament is not in session. I guess on this occasion I am not sure what influenced the timing of the resignation. It is somewhat regrettable that the resignation did not coincide with the sittings of the State Parliament of Western Australia&mdash;other than, as I understand it, one extraordinary sitting to pass the very controversial Juveniles Act. I do not think this was a case where another month or two either side would have hurt in terms of the resignation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From September, Senator McKiernan tells me. So she could well have resigned and met the requirement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, of course, an alternative method, which I think has been used on several occasions, whereby an appointment can be made by the Executive Council, I think it is, of whatever State it is and, in turn, that appointment is later confirmed by State parliament. But it also has to be said, in some defence of the Western Australian Government, that it has to act on the legal advice that it has been given, and I understand that that is what is really motivating this agenda. There are no political agendas in this case. There is no advantage to be derived for the Labor Party generally from not having the senator-designate here at the moment. I think it is not surprising that the Western Australian Government, having obtained that legal advice, is now abiding by it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying, however, that that legal advice is valid, and I do not know that it can be tested. It is just a pity that this country did not, a few years ago, support the referendum proposal for advisory opinions in the High Court. We could well have taken this particular issue to the High Court for an advisory opinion, without a large and expensive legal case, and got a view on it which would clean it up once and for all. But, not only in this case but also in every other case like this, we run the danger of a State Attorney-General's office coming forward with advice that this matter is not without doubt, and that is the problem in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, I was in Cabinet when Senator Coulter was speaking on this question so I do not know which particular line he took or whether he accused us simply of political bloody-mindedness or stupidity. I tend to think that the latter would probably be more appropriate in these sorts of cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like Senator Collins, I also want to note for the record what is a growing hypocrisy in the Opposition. This Opposition is starting to act like an entrenched Opposition&mdash;like it has been there forever and will be there forever. Its previous actions in government are constantly now forgotten and buried in the mists of time. As Senator Collins pointed out, the Liberal Party on other occasions has not supported these sorts of motions but rather has voted in the opposite manner. And that is just becoming replicated right throughout the procedures of this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I had the great honour of walking into this place last year and guillotining 62 Bills, one would not believe the squawks out of those opposite. Yet, when one went back through the record, all the recidivists there had voted for similar motions; not only for guillotines, but for gagging the guillotine debate as well. We are seeing another example of that here today; we are seeing it time and time again. The Opposition here does not fully understand the role of an opposition. It is not to oppose everything. It is not to be political on everything. But, if honourable senators opposite are going to do that, at least let us see some consistency from them. Senator Collins, I understand, praised the Democrats for being consistent on this. That is fair enough. Apparently, they are the only ones who have been consistent in this particular case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, it is regrettable that our seventy-sixth senator is not with us today. I do not believe the Western Australian Government acted maliciously on this particular point. I think, having got the legal advice from the Attorney-General, it would have had some problems with proceeding on another course. On the question of whether this chamber has been bitterly deprived of a senator, I will reserve judgment until I see that honourable senator's ability. I do not think there has been a division in this chamber that has been as close as one vote&mdash;honourable senators may correct me if I am wrong. But this is a matter that should be dispatched as quickly as possible. Again, I do not know the date when the State Parliament is resuming. I assume it is within a week or two. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I will just take a few minutes to express my appreciation to Senator Knowles and Senator Campbell for their remarks in relation to this motion, and to deprecate the remarks of Senator Walsh, most of which were quite irrelevant. I can understand Senator Walsh not particularly liking Senator Vallentine or what she stood for, but the fact is that she was elected by the people of Western Australia and she had a legitimate place in this chamber. That is really the point; that her replacement, equally, has a legitimate place in this chamber, irrespective of what Senator Walsh might think of her views.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I would make in this connection&mdash;and this was picked up by Senator McKiernan&mdash;is that she was elected by the electors of Western Australia to fill a particular role as they saw it. That is the democratic principle. It does not matter what we think of our fellow senators in terms of how many times they come into the chamber or what issues they vote upon. That is not the point. The point is that with her particular views, she was elected to represent the electors of Western Australia and to express those views in this chamber. If she chose to express those views on a limited range of issues because they were the issues that concerned the electors who put her here, she was in fact fulfilling her proper function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the number of times Senator Vallentine spoke, we find that the statistics are rather interesting. In the Weekly Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> we find that Senator Vallentine spoke on 259 occasions, whereas Senator McKiernan spoke on 128 occasions. In the Historic Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> we find that Senator Vallentine spoke on 180 occasions and Senator McKiernan on 98 occasions. So, in terms of the actual issues that she chose to take up&mdash;presumably because she was elected to take up those issues&mdash;she clearly performed her function. I think that is further indicated by the fact that she was not elected only once&mdash;the electors of Western Australia elected her again. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the real point is this: that the Western Australian Parliament met on 5 February. It was a sitting at which both Houses were present. A joint sitting could have been arranged, quite contrary to what Senator Walsh seemed to imply. It probably would have taken a little longer than the two or three minutes that some senators have suggested, but certainly no more than 10 minutes. I seem to recall that Senator Lees was processed through the South Australian Parliament in about 10 minutes from beginning to end.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate endorses moving the Australian economy toward a pattern of ecologically sustainable development, recognising that such movement is consistent with a substantial reduction in unemployment and an attack on the growing foreign debt.</PARA>
<PARA>The motion now before us is one which I believe the Senate can also support because it expresses a view which has been widely endorsed, both by the Government and also by the Opposition, that the Australian economy, in moving towards an ecologically sustainable pattern of development can, at the same time, substantially address the problem of unemployment and make a substantial attack on foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definition of `sustainable development' which is often used&mdash;I know that former Senator Chaney, now Mr Chaney, has quoted it in the House of Representatives&mdash;is that contained in the Brundtland Report entitled `<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Our Common Future</EMPHASIS>'. The definition given there describes sustainable development as development which meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, what one has here is a definition which accepts not only the principle of equity within a particular generation, but also takes as quite fundamental that there should be equity between the generations. In other words, the present generation should not so use or abuse the resources which are available to it that succeeding generations do not have available to them at least the resources of an equivalent nature to meet their own needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all aware that the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, introduced a number of committees to research the ESD program, and those committees have now reported. However, in speaking to the three chairs of the ESD working groups, he outlined four fundamental goals. The first was the improvement of individual and community well-being and welfare by following the path of economic progress that did not impair the welfare of future generations. There again one has an expression of the principle of inter-generational equity. The second was the provision of equity within and between generations, and there it is made quite explicit. The third was the recognition of the global dimension, and there one has a broader recognition of equity within the present generation. The final goal was the protection of biological diversity and the maintenance of ecological processes and systems. One has a recognition there of the fundamental nature of ecological systems and the role which those systems play in maintaining an on-going, viable economy in this or any other country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems rather strange that when one looks at many of the debates which have arisen around this general theme, one finds that the protection of the environment and job growth are often seen as mutually exclusive or even as contradictory goals. Despite the fact that industry was involved in the Hawke Government's ESD process, and contributed very extensively to the reports of those various committees, some parts of industry in Australia have quite strongly expressed the view that it is either the environment and sustainability or jobs and economic prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's definition directly links employment and the improvement of individual and community well-being and welfare, and the provision of equity within and between generations with the principle of sustainability. High levels of unemployment contravene this principle of equity. I think we all believe in inter-generational equity because we all believe in a fair go. This principle says that a fair go, a level playing field, should be extended beyond the present generation to future generations. It is based on the general idea of equality of opportunity and extending that idea to later generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, the use of non-renewable resources cannot form part of a pattern of sustainability and of sustainable development unless part of those resources is devoted to the materialisation&mdash;and I use that word quite deliberately and advisedly&mdash;of alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, there is no way in which one can use coal in a renewable way. It is a non-renewable resource. But a society which is committed to sustainability must quite clearly devote sufficient of the resources which come from the economic benefit of burning the coal so that the next generation will have at least the same amount of energy available to it. In other words, there must be the actualisation of technologies which will provide the energy for the future generation if this present generation chooses to use coal. Similarly, in relation to so-called renewable resources, a society cannot be said to be sustainable if indeed it uses those non-renewable resources in non-sustainable ways. The rate at which renewable resources are used must clearly be in strict proportion to the rate at which those resources such as forests or other natural systems can renew themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been given in recent times to the notion of the market and the fundamental nature which the market should play in a modern industrial society. Great emphasis is given to this by both the Government and the Opposition. One of the fundamental principles which underlies the market and is linked to the idea of fairness&mdash;fairness between individuals in the present generation and future generations&mdash;is the idea of a level playing field; that those who operate in the market are indeed given equal opportunities to participate in that market system. Of course, when one starts looking at markets, one finds that very often those playing fields are anything but level. The area in which they are most unlevel is in relation to internalising what economists call externalities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the principal externalities is the idea of bringing into present prices a representation which future generations may make on those markets if they were present here to make those demands. Clearly, if one is to use the market system and one is given to the principle of level playing fields, one is therefore committed to the notion of internalising externalities and one should be attempting to write into present prices those demands which future generations will make on those resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, coal is principally burnt for the making of electricity. In Australia coal is the principal source of our electricity. Since 1983 the Labor Government has devoted certain funds to energy research. But one finds that only one-tenth of the amount of money put into energy research has actually gone into providing those alternatives which will address the problems of the next generation, while in California one has seen the development of a number of technologies which are currently competitive&mdash;even if one does not internalise those externalities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One finds among those technologies the development of wind generation of electricity and solar thermal generation of electricity in which the costs, even without the internalisation of those externalities, are still reasonably competitive. So a sensible development in this country of sustainability would be to move towards those technologies, recognising that they move us towards greater sustainability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time&mdash;and here I make very strongly the point which lies at the heart of this motion&mdash;we must realise that those technologies will provide a great deal more employment than the use of coal burning technology in large central power stations. Moreover, because we do not make any heavy generating equipment in this country, the use of those technologies also involves the use of equipment which can be totally manufactured in this country. Therefore, the use of this technology can at the same time address this very serious and growing problem of the large foreign debt. So in the area of electricity and energy use through the use of electricity we have a key example of the way in which the problems of unemployment, the problems of foreign debt and the problems of moving towards a sustainable pattern of development can be married together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, one finds that the Government has not pursued that sort of path. Indeed, in the One Nation statement, one finds that the Government is to reduce the sales tax on cars&mdash;not in any way which would move us towards greater sustainability but simply across the board. If the Government&mdash;and I make this criticism in that the Government has passed up a marvellous opportunity here&mdash;had chosen to remove the sales tax on a sliding scale which related to the fuel efficiency of the car, then indeed employment in the car industry may have been stimulated at the same time as moving towards sustainability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of our principal criticisms of the Opposition in relation to its goods and services tax bears precisely on this point. When a 15 per cent single tax is fixed and the sales tax regime is removed the opportunity is denied through the tax system of internalising those externalities which relate to the use of non-renewable resources and the need to address the problem of making those resources available to the next generation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could develop other alternatives in relation to other industries in Australia. One of those industries, of course, is the paper industry which is very much to the fore in debates at the present time in relation to northern Tasmania. There are other ways of meeting the $1.6 billion worth of paper imports into this country&mdash;again addressing the problem of the foreign debt&mdash;without building large pulp mills based on old growth forests and causing the non-sustainable environmental damage that that involves. The alternatives depend upon annual crops, which again can be grown much more effectively, can produce much greater amounts of fibre per hectare and can provide much greater local employment, thus stimulating and supporting local industry. At the same time it addresses the problem of foreign indebtedness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The points that really stand out in this debate, with which I hope both the old parties will agree, is that ecologically sustainable development is about Australia becoming a clever country. To be clever, we have to expand and create value added industries in rural and manufacturing sectors, and that cleverness also requires the protection of our environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ecologically sustainable development will become the mainstream economic approach of our future. It is already becoming the mainstream approach of many other nations. In those nations there is a growing recognition with many of our trading partners that sustainable development makes good economic sense. We will be left behind unless we work seriously at moving towards ecologically sustainable development. To put ESD on the back-burner&mdash;which seems to be the practice, if not the preferred attitude, of both Labor and the coalition parties&mdash;is not very clever. It will not produce a clever country; nor will it provide a viable future for our children. </PARA>

<PARA>While listening to Senator Coulter, albeit for only the last half of his contribution&mdash;I was unable to be here earlier&mdash;I detected a note of complaint. I noted that Senator Coulter did not think the Government was serious about ecologically sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the number of pages of reports under the heading of ecologically sustainable development is any measure, the Government is certainly serious. More important is a united front in moving to make ESD very much a central part of the Government's program. I have no trouble at all in saying that, at least for a large part of the sentiment expressed in the motion, I am happy to stand up and support it. That is because, amongst other reasons, however we want to emphasise questions of ecologically sustainable development; they are vitally important. If it takes that set of words and a series of inquiries to make our governments and business and industry leaders in this country, to say nothing of other planners, take seriously questions of the contribution of this generation's production to the next, then we would have to say, `Hear, hear'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make a couple of comments on the specifics about the ESD argument. Earlier, when some of the draft documents on the ESD debate were proposed and circulated, it was drawn to my attention by a colleague in South Australia that the word `health' had never been mentioned in the whole debate. I was very pleased on his behalf to put his letter of concern into the pipeline so that health considerations could get onto the ESD agenda. Indeed, those considerations are now on both the agenda and in this intersectoral issues report. In that report there is a page of recommendations addressing health questions through occupational health and safety and the impact of environmental concerns on health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons I am principally concerned about this is because of the economics. What is the point of trying to cure people downstream at a considerable outlay of health dollars when, with some appropriate thinking and planning, those diseases could be avoided? The example that springs to mind most readily is that of the Wittenoom asbestos mine in Western Australia. As early as 1946, one of the duties of Dr&mdash;later Professor&mdash;Saint from the Western Australian Department of Health was to visit and inspect that mine. He made recommendations about the amount of dust and the way that dust should have been dampened down. Those recommendations were ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, nearly 50 years later, we are seeing very high pay-outs in the courts to people who have been found to have mesothelioma, which is judged to have been caused by their life in the mine or nearby; that is, the families of miners were also at risk and indeed suffered mesothelioma. Millions of dollars in compensation are being paid when a large amount of that illness, and certainly that pay-out, could have been avoided by practising the appropriate ecologically sustainable course way back then. So even in straight efficiencies the economies of good practice and prevention in the outlay of introducing dust absorption or dampening down equipment would have played a large part in preventing the illness. In this instance we can actually put a figure on how much it will cost this many years later. That, of course, is a dollar cost and it does not measure the cost of human misery, pain and suffering and the loss to families of the breadwinner or other members who have died as a result of that disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many examples in the history of industrial development of diseases and extraordinarily expensive clean-ups necessary because of poor industrial practice. Even if we did not become positively committed to the future developments or benefits from ESD, we could at least be committed to ecologically sustainable development through the good practices of the systems we currently know, as in good occupational health and safety. In industry there are many examples over the years of the extraordinary cost, damage and death as a result of very poor industrial practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are obvious examples of air pollution through the number of people who have suffered disease and illness as a consequence of it. It is interesting that the people who suffer chest diseases, asthma and so on from air pollution do not really capture the hearts and minds of governments as much as the cost of having to clean up. It seems that the dollar costs impacted more than the health of the citizens of any country. That is very regrettable, but I am pleased that the dollar debate is now on the side of the angels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other great example of poor industrial practice that has led, and continues to lead, to unnecessary outlays as a consequence of ill-health has been water pollution, in particular through chemically laden industrial waste run-off from various factories around the place. We could even talk about the environmental and water pollution from the disposal of sewage. We have seen some fairly stunning reports of that over the past few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not until the tourists visiting Bondi Beach were upset that governments acted. For many years Australian citizens suffered the indignity of sewage pollution on their beaches. But when it finally impacted on the dollar benefits of the tourist industry governments acted. If this sounds too cynical, I make no apologies at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many people who fought for the issues that are now collectively called ecologically sustainable development, what might in the past have been called decent, appropriate, good practice, and has been ignored over the years, it is now some comfort to find these issues being taken seriously. But it is also a mite annoying that it was not the rightness of the cause that won the debate but the dollar cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reports that have emerged over the past month or so from the ecologically sustainable development working groups deserve our serious consideration, or at least the consideration of anybody who is interested in the ESD process.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exact number of people so affected is rather difficult to ascertain. Some have put the figure in the area of a few hundred and some have put it in the thousands. There was some suggestion today that it could be up to 50,000, depending on how we count those who have dropped out. It is a matter of whether we take into consideration those who simply do not apply again, in other words, those who were receiving family allowance prior to the assets testing; or whether we just count those who have now applied for the family allowance but have been refused, even under the hardship provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One set of amendments we will be moving is trying to do the same thing we have tried to do on many occasions, that is, change the assets testing provisions for the family allowance to exclude the tools of trade. I think those amendments are just being circulated; they are the ones I have attempted to move on a number of occasions. We have discussed the first set of amendments with honourable senators from other parties and we believe that they will be unsuccessful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second set of amendments is far more specific. If passed, they will ensure that those young people covered by the assistance for isolated children's bonus scheme are covered by this one-off payment. It does not mean that they will actually be able to get family allowance in the long term. They will not get onto the family allowance list. However, when it comes to this one-off payment, we believe that it is essential that these children be included. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the criticisms that has already been made is that we have not had this proposal fully costed. As I said previously, it is extremely difficult to know exactly how many young people are now missing out on family allowance. Even if every child under the isolated children's assistance scheme&mdash;and there are some 100,000&mdash;received it, it would amount to a sum of $12m. It seems far more likely that there are only a handful of children&mdash;in the thousands, or even in the tens of thousands&mdash;who are going to be able to get this. As I said, the numbers are not certain, and I apologise for the lack of costing. I would imagine that the absolute maximum figure is around $6m. When we consider that over $300m is being given out in this one-off payment, an additional $6m is not excessive. </PARA>

I apologise that I have only just been able to see this amendment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a little surprised&mdash;and I keep hearing it from those opposite in the debate&mdash;that they now seem to have distanced themselves from the principle upon which family allowances were established. It is a principle which was accepted by the then Minister in the Fraser Government and the then Opposition spokesman on social security, Senator the Hon. Don Grimes. The principle is that family allowances are really part of the tax transfer system and part of the taxation system, recognising that at any level of income a family with children has greater expenditure on necessities and other things and greater tax burdens than a family without children. That was the principle upon which family allowances were established. I can recall persons getting up in this chamber at that time saying that that was the principle. Indeed, Senator Grimes made a point of it at the economic summit, and it is mentioned in the documents of the economic summit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know what Opposition senators are doing, but I hear them continually complaining that the Government is not targeting family allowances to those in need. It is part of the tax system. The Government is targeting certain measures to poorer families by way of a family assistance supplement. I am often critical of the Government because it did not ensure that family allowances kept pace with inflation. Two years ago the Government introduced and passed legislation, which we all supported, for the indexation of family allowances, but it was from a low base and that was one of the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought that I should raise that point because I hear not only Senator Alston but also a number of others in the Opposition really striking at the very heart of what family allowances are all about. They should reconsider that, particularly in the light of their Fightback package.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry for digressing a little, but I believe that it was apt and appropriate to make those comments in the light of what was said in response to the amendment moved by Senator Lees. As far as it is concerned&mdash;from quickly running my eye over it&mdash;I would agree with it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose I have to claim that I have been provoked into responding. I cannot really let those remarks pass, 95 per cent of them being directed not at the amendment but to what Senator Harradine describes as our lack of wholehearted support for the family allowance system, which was introduced by the Fraser Government, and which I think we have reiterated in no uncertain terms in our Fightback package. No-one could seriously contest that we do not regard family allowances with the utmost importance and accord them a very high priority by virtue of the fact that we have undertaken to double them for families earning under $30,000, and to increase them by 50 per cent for families with incomes up to $40,000 and 6 per cent above that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also always stood for the notion of means testing transfer payments under the social security system. That is not to say for one moment that we regard family allowances as welfare, or that they are not to be seen as a recognition of the additional cost burdens on families. Indeed, if they are not seen in that light, there is no justification for paying them at all, unless families just happen to be group that is passing by that you want to throw some money at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole purpose of paying extra money to families with children is an explicit recognition that it costs more to raise children than to do without them. That is a different thing altogether from talking about un-means tested payments and it is a different thing again from talking about the effectiveness of a one-off payment. I do not recall, certainly not in my time, a government ever proposing a one-off payment of this or any other order. I have the gravest doubts about the effectiveness of it. Indeed, it is not even put forward as a welfare alleviation measure or as an assistance to families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan justified it in terms of demand stimulation and quarrelled with the proposition that tax cuts might do the job, presumably because they are permanent and therefore cost a lot more; I suspect that that is really why he was quibbling about it. He did not for a moment try to say that this is being done because there is now a recognition that at this point in time, 2 April 1992, families suddenly need another $125, or even $250 if they have five children or more; he did not put it forward in those terms. This is just a one-off payment. I have the greatest difficulty in appreciating its virtues, but that is not for one moment to derogate from the principle that underlies family allowances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply cannot have it said that we are in any way walking away from our commitment to the notion of family allowances. We would claim that we invented the concept. We deplore the fact that they were allowed to fall behind inflation rates for a number of years, and that all the Government did was lock them in at a low level. All the Government is doing now is throwing $125 at one section of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not seem that that will do anything at all to alleviate poverty or provide tangible assistance other than in the most transient manner. I do not regard that as targeting. Targeting is to look at who is suffering and find out who needs the assistance. It is a different proposition altogether to argue that families per se, because one has children, entitles one to have a higher ongoing permanent payment. What Senator Harradine presumably would argue for is that we ought to give more recognition than we do at the moment to the additional costs borne by families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those costs do not occur on one day&mdash;2 April. They occur every week of the year, every day of the year. The only way we can sensibly acknowledge the proposition that Senator Harradine would argue for is to give a permanent increase, as indeed the Government has done in relation to family allowance supplements. But when it comes to family allowances, all it has done is spray around a bit of confetti. We might not like the proposition that it has been done for the benefit of those in the electorate of Wills. I do not know why it has been done. I suppose the Government thinks it has some merit, but it certainly escapes me and I just do not think it meets any of those objectives that we are concerned about&mdash;and certainly not what Senator Harradine would argue for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So do not confuse my great lack of support or enthusiasm for this proposition with any suggestion that somehow we are weakening in our support of family allowances.

If Senator Alston is saying, as he appears to be saying, that they are not targeted properly, that they should be means tested, then he is ignoring what occurred in 1976. In 1976, as Senator Alston knows, the tax rebate system was abolished for children and this was then cashed up and paid to the parent of the children, normally the mother. That was not means tested. The tax rebate system actually applied to everybody.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the difficulties with the tax rebate system, and particularly the difficulty with the tax concession for children, was that it was not obtainable by a significant group of families on low income. That was another reason to welcome the abolition of the rebate system and the transfer of the money directly to the mother. There were a number of reasons. That had been argued by Albert Monk back in 1943, if Senator Alston wants to go back that far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel that it is important not to consider family allowances as a social security measure but to consider&mdash;as Senator Alston's Government considered in 1976; as this Government considered over a period of time; and as did Senator Grimes, the then Minister, when the economic summit was about&mdash;them as a tax transfer system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one adopts the attitude Senator Alston is adopting, one will say, `Any business will have its taxation provisions relate to its income'. For example, every company can claim depreciation against machinery and so on. That does not apply other than on the basis of horizontal equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two aspects here: horizontal equity and vertical equity. The vertical equity aspect is covered to a certain extent by the taxation system and the different rates of taxation. The horizontal equity in this particular area should apply across the board. It always did apply across the board until such time as people then looked upon the family allowance as a social welfare payment. I think it is essential at some stage for the Committee to be reminded of those salient facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to the point, finally, that it is not fair to suggest that I am agreeing wholeheartedly with just the one-off payment. I said this afternoon&mdash;and I draw Senator Alston's attention to the speech I made this afternoon&mdash;that I welcomed the decision of the Government because it was an acknowledgment of the fact that the burden of the recession was being borne very heavily by families. But I also indicated and quoted from the Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett) that he regarded this as being a kick-start to the economy. I indicated with the assistance of tables that really what should be done&mdash;and I invite the Minister at some stage to look at what I said&mdash;is to give a permanent and appropriate increase to family allowances. I also welcomed the permanent weekly increase given in the family assistance supplement. That is simply what I wished to say.

I think it is appropriate for me to repeat that assurance, because the Minister is keen to consider the problem which he believes Senator Lees has rightly raised but perhaps not so rightly put into the form of the amendment that we see here tonight.

A lot of them will have delayed small purchases for their children, and I think they will be delighted to receive that payment, get on with those purchases, and in so doing help out the economy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory proposes that the name of the Committee be changed. I have already spoken to this report briefly&mdash;as I always seem to do on ACT reports. In order to change the name of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory to something that is more appropriate, we have to define the actual area in which the Commonwealth has an interest now that the Australian Capital Territory has self-government. There has been a delay of three years. Until the plan is settled, and areas which were clearly the responsibility of the Federal Government and the Territory Government are defined, there is reason for the Committee to continue under its present name.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is still working under its old name. It is now inquiring into the open spaces which are still the Commonwealth's responsibility. There will be work for the Committee to do in the future. I suggest that there may be a time when it will be appropriate for the Committee and the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Zone to be incorporated into one committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention the demise of the Australian Capital Territory Committee because it is, if not the oldest, one of the oldest joint committees of this Parliament. The Committee was established in 1957 at a time when, following the Menzies decision that Australia should have a national capital of which the nation would be proud, it was clearly appropriate and necessary for the Parliament to take a more active role. It was not sufficient to merely leave it to government to run the national capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, over the years the Parliament has shown very clearly that it is interested in the national capital. One might say that it has been ambivalent: on the one hand, Federal parliamentarians are inclined to knock Canberra and, on the other hand, when there are issues about its planning they have always taken a great interest. For the most part, the work of the Committee over the years has related to variations of the city plan, changes in the roads and the lay out of Canberra and approving the subdivisions of the new suburbs as they were built. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will recall that the ACT was represented in the House of Representatives for a number of years by Mr Jim Fraser, a Labor member who had voting rights only in respect of issues directly affecting the ACT. Subsequently, the ACT gained full representation. It had one Federal member, then two Federal members and then two senators. Who knows where it will end&mdash;around about there I should imagine for some time. After senators for the Territory were first elected at the end of 1975, the Committee undertook more work in the nature of normal committee inquiries into matters affecting the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My predecessor, John Knight, was the Chairman of that Committee. I became the Chairman after he died&mdash;which was 11 years ago yesterday. John Knight prepared a document on the history of the Committee from 1957 until 1980. That document contains a very valuable history not only of a parliamentary committee but the Committee's relationship with the Territory which it served.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> With the ACT having its own government, the scope of the previous Committee is no longer appropriate. More than 100 senators and members served on it over its lifetime. I think there were 12 different chairmen. For a long time the chairman was always a member of the Senate. A lot of people have taken an active part in the work of the Committee. I certainly support the change of name because it reflects what has happened in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall be pleased to continue to be on the Committee which remains to look after the Parliament's interests in this Territory, as I have an interest from both points of view. It is a time to mark the passing of that Committee and to recognise the work done by those who have been on it over the years. We will continue to get on with the job of looking after what is left of the Territory as a Commonwealth issue. I hope that the Commonwealth will always continue to fund that portion of its interest in a proper and appropriate manner befitting the status of the national capital. </PARA>

As you would realise, the Rural and Regional Affairs Committee came into being as a result of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare, which selectively reported for eight years. Through our actions and those of the Government and the Democrats, we realised that there was not a Senate standing committee that reflected the portfolio of primary industry. I believe there had not been one in existence since about 1945.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Committee came into being late in December last year. Because of the horrific drought problem around Australia, our first reference was to look at the effects of the national drought policy, the drought task force recommendations, and the practical effect they would have on the farmers of Australia, who were trying to come to terms with probably the most horrific drought since 1983. As you would remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, the drought broke in 1983 at about the time our former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, came to power.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am not a hobby farmer, although Senator Panizza might consider me to be a hobby farmer compared with himself. As a farmer, I have never before experienced so much devastation and hopelessness among the farmers we met. The only other time I had experienced this sort of feeling was in 1967, after the horrific bushfires in Tasmania, when farmers were burnt out and left with nothing. Some of the people the Committee spoke to were fourth and fifth generation farmers&mdash;from the western region of New South Wales, from the Eyre Peninsula and from places such as Jerdacuttup or Ravensthorpe, where my colleague Senator Crane comes from. They have never before experienced such conditions. They have had to cope with droughts and dry spells and all the rest of it, but they have never had this combination of drought, recession, banks screwing them to the floor, and all the other things that go with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a baptism of fire, our Committee had to experience the traumas and dramas of what is happening around the rural communities of Australia. Whilst members of the Government have taken some note of what is happening in rural Australia&mdash;in fact, this applies to people on our side of politics too&mdash;I do not think they fully understand what goes on. People such as Senator Panizza, Senator Crane and Senator Brownhill and I know because we actually live this sort of life and mix with people who have to put up with these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee had to front up to third and fourth generation farmers who had had 20,000 sheep and ask, `How is the drought affecting you?'  We would be told, `We might have 2,000 sheep left but we cannot tell because we are too frightened to start looking for them. They are in such poor condition that if we stir them up they might fall over and die anyway'. Those were the sorts of comments made to us during our public hearings. I know Senator Crane would support my comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has been slow in reacting to rural counselling needs, but I notice that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS>, the statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), he put forward proposals for funding for rural counsellors through to 1995. I have to ask: if Mr Keating and the Government feel that there is a need for rural counsellors through to 1995, what sort of projections do they have for the rural community?  The only reason we have rural counsellors is to counsel rural people. It was apparent from evidence given to the Committee that there has been a huge increase in suicides, particularly among young people. We had evidence that even bank managers were committing suicide. They were obviously involved with their clients and the desperation of the rural community has forced them into taking their own lives, which is unbelievable in this day and age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that was apparent to me and to other Committee members is how serious this matter is. The drought, the recession, the high interest rates, the low commodity prices and so on are catastrophic and have compounded to force our once proud rural community into despair. Governments of whatever political persuasion used to say that Australia rides on the sheep's back. The people who in the past have been such big producers of wealth for Australia have been badly affected by the drought. We had the opportunity of seeing the sorts of things they are concerned about. They do not want to rely on handouts; they believe that the IED scheme put forward by the Government was reasonably successful, but the changes made were not successful. In other words, they would like to go back to the old IED scheme or an IED scheme that they would be interested in investing in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to our evidence, there is no doubt that the assistance given by the New South Wales and Queensland governments in the form of transport subsidies has been most effective, and this goes back to previous droughts. Some of the most effective things on the ground have been transport subsidies that allow farmers to move stock out or move fodder in. They are the sorts of subsidies that farmers look for. Repeatedly, the farmers said, `We are not looking for handouts; we are looking for the most effective way of coping with what to us are natural disasters'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to my main point. The Government and the task force have said that droughts should not be considered natural disasters. No matter where one lives or farms, when one gets conditions severe enough to create problems that one has not experienced for 20, 30 or 40 years, if that is not a natural disaster, I do not know what is. When one has a flood, immediately the Government says it is a natural disaster. That is a point that has been put to us in just about every place we went; that the Government should think again about changing its position on the question of droughts not being considered natural disasters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other aspects of drought that have been put to us. The main things, however, relate to the rural adjustment scheme and the sorts of assistance that help to move stock in and out. With those few words, I will complete my small contribution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, I rise to make some comments on this report and on the current situation with regard to drought in Australia, particularly the effects of the most recent drought over much of Australia. I support the comments of my colleague Senator Calvert and also those of the other Committee members who spoke, the Chairman, Senator West and Senator Brownhill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also particularly pleased to see Senator Cook here tonight in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. We have a major task in terms of bringing about an attitudinal change with respect to extreme drought, not only as far as the Government is concerned but also in respect of some members of the Opposition. I have to say that I have a personal vested interest in the outcome of this report because my own property, which my son is on now, is probably in the worst hit drought area in Western Australia. Certainly the situation is equal to that in the pastoral areas up in the Pilbara, Ashburton and Murchison. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that matter, when we went to the Jerdacuttup-Munglinup district, evidence was given to us by a number of people that the properties, over the last 2 1/2 years, had been destocked by over 70 per cent, which has an enormous impact on people's ability to cope in these particular circumstances. Even if we were in good times, which we are not, it would make it very difficult. One of the tasks we have in terms of defining drought and looking at its impact is to recognise that, in terms of extreme drought, there must come a time&mdash;for example, I suggest when one starts getting into one's third year, particularly in those districts that have not experienced continuous drought&mdash;when there is a role for the Federal Government alongside the State governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that I particularly want to raise with regard to this inquiry is that we have effectively been without a drought policy in this country since prior to May 1990. In fact, it goes back some six or nine months before that, before the National Drought Policy Review Committee made its report. That report has been with us since May 1990. It is now March 1992, and we still do not have a drought policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very few people argued with us about the principle or the philosophy behind people preparing themselves for drought or, for that matter, any natural disaster. They did not have a problem, in principle, with the term `self-reliance' which has become, I guess, the vogue term as far as drought is concerned. But they were highly critical of the situation that has developed here; firstly, because of the inconsistency between States in terms of what was being done, and, secondly, in terms of that movement to self-reliance. People have not been given a period in which to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As one individual said to us, `We can put away a haystack of hay', which has a minimal life; `we can put away a silo of grain', which, once again, with the impact of weevils and other things, has a minimal life; `but we do not have a mechanism whereby we can put away a haystack of money'. I believe that the decision of the Federal Government some time ago to change very significantly the IED scheme that we have in place and, in effect, render it useless was a very poor policy decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not argue against the fact that some people abused it. But what I would say to the Government&mdash;in fact, to all people in the House of Representatives and the Senate&mdash;is that the policy position should not be, because some people abuse something, to remove it; it should be to fix up the abuses that were occurring. Of course, now, in terms of a drought policy, we find that there is not an effective IED scheme; there is no way that individual producers can protect themselves against the ravages of drought and the subsequent drop in income. I would urge the Government very strongly, and the various State agriculture Ministers who are dealing with this, to act on this aspect of the matter very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing we saw was that the effects of drought differ very significantly from district to district and from State to State. In some areas of Australia the problem was water. In other areas one of the biggest single factors which exacerbated the drought situation was feral animals and kangaroos, particularly goats and rabbits. In other areas we found that the impacts on the grain industry were quite different from the impacts on the stock industry. In some areas we found the problem of woody weeds and we also ran into the situation of wind erosion, which creates another set of problems. So we cannot have just a single mechanism or way of dealing with the particular problem. In terms of the definition, I think that it is very important that a clear indication of what constitutes an extreme drought be given to the industry. Of course, tied in with this is rainfall distribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already mentioned the IEDs. The other matter that I must raise is the taxation arrangements that need to be in place to assist, encourage and provide an incentive for individual producers to drought-proof themselves in terms of water measures and protection against a drop-off in feed in terms of the storage of hay and grain. In one particular area we saw&mdash;I think it was Bourke&mdash;a particular producer had puts oats under the ground. The oats had been there for nine years before he pulled them out. Yet that particular producer at that particular time could get no technical advice in terms of what to do and where to store the oats. So there is much that can be done in terms of providing incentives and information to assist the producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is&mdash;and my colleague, Senator Calvert, touched on this&mdash;whether or not drought should be included as part of the natural disaster relief arrangements. I quote one witness who said, `It is totally illogical to include flood&mdash;too much rain&mdash;under natural disaster relief arrangements and exclude drought&mdash;too little rain.' I find it very difficult to mount a sustainable argument against that, just as I find it very difficult to mount a sustainable argument against severe cyclone damage qualifying as a natural disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this report shows that there is need for a reassessment by Parliament of what constitutes `drought' and what role Commonwealth and States should play in drought relief. Further, the Commonwealth and State Ministers for agriculture should spell out clearly and quickly&mdash;because, after all, they have had nearly two years to consider it&mdash;what the drought policy in this country is to be. I also reiterate the point that Senator Calvert made in relation to rural counsellors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One concern which came up quite consistently in a number of areas was the role of the Rural Adjustment Authority, how it operated and how it was administered. It is a reflection on government policy that producer after producer said to us, `The last thing we need at this time is to have more money thrown at us. We have no income. We have no capacity to meet our current debt. To give us more money is to throw good money after bad.' There needs to be a reassessment of the transitional assistance that has been given in the past with respect to the cartage of stock and fodder, and more consideration must be given to taxation arrangements, such as IEDs and taxation incentives to invest in drought-proofing measures, such as water and fodder conservation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be looking very closely at the role of tax credits and how they can impact on the overall capacity of producers to make themselves self reliant. </PARA>

<PARA>The Committee which you and Senator Crane were part of was set the task of looking at some 58 recommendations of the National Drought Policy Review Task Force. We were told in some of our submissions that the task force was not in total agreement and this was confirmed by a couple of people on the task force who said that they disagreed with some of the findings. Two of those people are, I believe, quite eminent members of the rural community who understand what happens out in the real world, out in the bush, where people have to battle Dorothea Mackellar-type `droughts and flooding rains'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Committee we looked at the 58 recommendations to see whether they were relevant and whether they were couched in the right terms. The first recommendation concerned the natural disaster relief arrangements. The Drought Policy Review Task Force was opposed to the reinstatement of drought within those arrangements. When speaking on this matter the other day, I said that it did not really matter whether drought fell within the natural disaster relief arrangements or not, as long as the Commonwealth Government realised that it had to give some assistance once the economic capabilities of individuals and the State were unable to cope with a drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also looked at the recommendation of the Policy Review Task Force relating to self-reliance. From the 67 submissions that we received, and from the nearly 170 witnesses who appeared before the Committee, it was overwhelmingly clear that the farming community wants to be self-reliant in times of drought, but that they cannot become self-reliant unless the Government of the day sets the parameters for them to be so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is interesting that one of the first references to self-reliance was made by the National Farmers Federation when it said that we should encourage self-reliance in managing drought, facilitate the early recovery of industry from drought, ensure adequate protection of livestock and other resources, and minimise the loss of high-value international markets. As a Committee, we agreed with that because that is basically what the farming community is on about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the witnesses, rural counsellor Mrs Kathleen Sims, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general&mdash;and this includes right down to the hardest battler and one who is leaving his property&mdash;I have not found a farmer who would say that the philosophy of self reliance is wrong. I think farmers are basically looking to be self reliant. They are not looking for any handouts. However, in reality, in Australia's climate, drought hits hard, and without some form of assistance, of whatever kind, they feel they are not going to be able to make it through.</PARA>
<PARA>Here was someone who was out in the community, talking to the farming community and actually finding out what real farmers thought about things. This was not some bureaucrat in Canberra saying what he thought was good for the farming community, but a person of great character who was out there actually talking to people in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this report the Committee definitely endorsed the concept of self reliance in relation to drought management. However, the Committee also subscribed to the view that there is a need for effective depreciation and other tax measures to provide incentive to farmers and graziers to become self reliant. We advised farmers at the time that we had yet to prepare a further report on this matter, but even at this stage it is clear that we must devise a way of helping people to look after themselves. Surely, that is what life is about. Take IEDs as an example. As Senator Cook would know, since he represents the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) in this place, there are no big cash flows at the moment to enable people to make use of income equalisation deposits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said the other day&mdash;and as Senator Crane pointed out many times in the inquiry&mdash;it may be that we need a mechanism such as tax credits as an interim measure until such time that people are again able to put money aside in income equalisation deposits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the people on the Government side of the chamber, the people who took away the value of income equalisation deposits, the people who actually castrated&mdash;that would be a good description, because they have made them impotent&mdash;the way they handle the income equalisation deposits, that income equalisation deposits now are not serving the purpose they served leading up to the 1982-83 drought period. There is no doubt that if we can get back income equalisation deposits whereby people have the incentive to put money away in good times, get the carrot given to them to put money away so that when the bad periods come they can withdraw that money and pay tax at the ruling rate at that time on the amount of income they receive in that bad year, we will achieve something for the communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think people in this chamber&mdash;I know the Committee does now because it has been out having a look at what was happening out in the communities&mdash;realise the hardship and heartbreak that has really hit people in the rural communities. Only today, for example, the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs had the Isolated Children's Parents Association come before it to talk about the hardship associated with people in isolated areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very easy for us to all walk back to our offices here tonight, lift the telephone and ring up whomever we want to ring up. The Committee was given instances today&mdash;and you, Mr Acting Deputy President, were at the meeting&mdash;of people being told that, due to the mail run and the isolation they did not get the notice, their telephones had been cut off. Solely because those people were so isolated, Telecom very unfeelingly cut their telephones off without really even thinking about the consequences of their actions on people living out in those isolated areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reckon a fair go for people in the rural communities is what everyone is on about in this place. I think even people on the other side of the chamber would agree. Unless people in the farming communities who are out there earning export income can receive assistance, help, support and incentive in the good times so that when the bad times come they can look after themselves, we will not have those export industries producing the income that gives the people that are sitting at the table here, the people that are sitting on the other side, the standard of living that we all have had in the past.

I had some notes when I first read this report. Not only can I not find the notes but I cannot find the report. However, there are many people in this chamber that know what drought is all about. Senator Brownhill is of the opinion that maybe there are not quite enough people who know about drought, but I think, for the times that Senator Crane, myself, Senator Brownhill and the National Party of Australia have told the Senate about drought, people should understand what it is to experience it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Drought is like death; it is almost as certain as death. One can expect a drought every four to five years in New South Wales; in Western Australia we expect a drought every six to seven years. The east has not had a drought since that disastrous drought of 1982. That is the drought that elected this Government. This Government ran its election campaign on the recession that came out of that drought. That is how it got elected. When the rain came the next year it claimed credit for having broken the drought and for having turned the recession around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way to beat drought is to conserve three things. In addition to conserving one's energy, people should conserve fodder, water and cash. To conserve fodder, people should not really need any incentive, although they should know that they can lose stock very quickly once drought comes in and the feed runs out. I think that governments of all colours and persuasions should provide a certain amount of incentive for fodder by depreciation of plant&mdash;maybe accelerated depreciation&mdash;and of course of the buildings into which the hay or whatever they use for fodder is put. At present, I understand that people write off hay sheds over 30 years; so there is not much incentive there. Plant for haymaking does not have a motor, so people probably write that plant off over about 10 years. More incentive has to be put their way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conservation of water is very important, especially in the vast areas of the eastern States as well as in Western Australia which does not have scheme water. Even if one has scheme water on one's property, it is very costly. The way to get over this problem for stock is to build bigger dams. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As generations pass, the dams seem to get bigger. I can remember when I was young a water dam of, say, 3,000 cubic metres being large. Ten or 15 years down the track anything of that size was very minimal and the going rate was 6,000 or 7,000 cubic metres. The dams have now been enlarged to about 10,000 cubic metres. If we have dams of that size, when these floods come such as the recent ones in the east&mdash;we also get them in the west&mdash;or when the normal winter rains fall and the dams fill up, we will be able to last for at least four years before water becomes scarce. Surely, we have good rains every four years with which to fill the dams. Unfortunately, for those who need an incentive to build earth dams, the depreciation is not enough. The time during which it is written off is far too long. In the good seasons, when farmers and pastoral people could be encouraged to put money back into dams, not enough is done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area is the conservation of cash in good years. It all depends where one is in the farming game. People in areas on which nature smiles kindly such as New Zealand, Tasmania and certain parts of Victoria know that they will get a good season every year. But where I come from, a 13-inch rainfall district, people are always looking over their shoulders at drought. Mr Acting Deputy President, you were there many years ago when we were both young fellows. People in that area tend to conserve a little more than they do in the areas that the good Lord looks after every year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in this situation that the IEDs come in. IEDs have been laboured a fair bit in this chamber, but I do not think it hurts to run through the history of IEDs again. We used to have a good system, probably kicked off by Doug Anthony, who was an honourable member in the other place many years ago. I do not give much credit very often to the National Party, but Doug Anthony was a great fellow who represented the bush of Australia. IEDs were introduced while he was Minister and we had a pretty good system for quite a few years. But when my friend from Doodlakine in Western Australia, Senator Walsh, came along&mdash;and I tell him this every day&mdash;he said, `There is a rort in them. There has to be a rort. There is too much money in them. It is a rort for taxation'. Senator Walsh fiddled with IEDs and the Government threw them out. He then fiddled with them again, and we now have a system that does not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other day I read out to the Senate a table to illustrate that IEDs almost disappeared when these measures were applied. I do not know how many millions of dollars were in the deposits&mdash;I think $168m at its height&mdash;but within two or three years they had disappeared. At that time we had a very poor season and a downturn in wheat and wool prices and the deposits disappeared altogether. Of course, in government, we will restore the IEDs to the sorts of levels that existed previously; it is very important. </PARA>

Unfortunately, the Federal Government distributes finance to the various State organisations and that is where the whole scheme falls down. The assistance comes in three parts: farm build-up, carry on finance and household support. However, even though a lot of these officers are farmers or ex-farmers, they turn into bureaucrats overnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator West will know how it goes because even in New South Wales the money does not go out too fast, especially when it is needed to plant crops. It is pointless getting that money when the opportune time for planting the crop has gone. In my own farming situation the ideal time to plant a crop is between 1 May&mdash;if the good Lord sends us rain&mdash;and 10 June. If farmers do not start to plant crops until the last week in June or early July, they will be locked in and will not get a very good season at all. In that situation, if they have borrowed money and are paying interest, it puts them further behind the black ball and they would be better off not planting the crop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This scheme has been going in Western Australia and, no doubt, in all of Australia, for many years, but it does not matter, they have not learned how to get on. The reason is that it is too centralised. If the decisions for loaning money were left with the bank branches out in the country, it would be far better. That is how money should be distributed. In the One Nation package a certain amount of money is allocated to wheat planting. I hope that decisions on that will be left to the bank managers out in the bush who know their customers on a one-to-one basis. They will be able to make quick decisions and if farmers want to borrow money to plant crops, it can be done nice and early to get the best sorts of crops. </PARA>

We had a fantastic season in Western Australia and a lot of farmers have done better than they would have done, so I have always commended Premier Lawrence for that, although I do not commend her for very much else.

Once the drought has broken and there has been some rain, people who are in dire financial straits and unable to borrow from other sources would not be able to get money to put their crops in and start their cash flow. It is the actual harvesting of the crop that starts the cash flow, but they have to be able to afford to buy seed. This $20m for RAS Part B will help these people. </PARA>

Some people have failed to understand the scope and the enormity of the droughts which we have suffered in my home State of Queensland. The following example illustrates the point very clearly. In some areas of the Burnett around Proston even in the bad droughts of the 1970s and 1980s they managed to keep the stock alive and in vaguely decent condition. We have had stock in those areas dying in massive numbers, which is an indication that even in the better rainfall areas of our State, over the last six to 12 months we have suffered incredibly severe conditions and it has been extremely hard for many farmers to remain viable.</PARA></TALK.START>

When these people leave the industry we not only lose farmers and a commitment to the maintenance of those farms and the earning of export dollars for this nation, but, more importantly, we also lose the skills of those farmers; sometimes skills that have taken 20 or 30 years to build up. These are things that are not easily replaced.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is difficult to measure the real cost of drought simply in monetary terms.

He talked about RAS Part B and said that a lot of the money has gone into fodder and water freight subsidies and restocking subsidies. That is quite good for those who are involved principally in the grazing industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without any disrespect to Mr Bonthrone or the UGA, I say to the Government that the number of people who are affected by drought is far greater than those who are merely graziers. For example, on the Darling Downs in Queensland during this recent drought we had a major problem. Many of the grain crops failed and, as a consequence, not only was income lost there but it added a higher cost to other primary industries, for example, the feedlot industry. The feedlot industry in the Darling Downs had to go as far as South Australia to find fodder. It cost farmers $60 per tonne to bring that fodder up to Brisbane and then they had to meet the additional cost of transport from Brisbane to the Darling Downs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That affects the viability of the feedlot industry. It also affects the viability of industries such as the pork industry, which is very important. I have touched on that industry a number of times in this place and probably do not need to go any further. We need a comprehensive solution to drought. It is a major problem that faces this nation. I believe very strongly that self-reliance is the best policy but people must have the ability to become self-reliant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems at the moment is that when farmers make provision for storage of fodder or storage of water they cannot write off the cost in the same year in which they expend the money. If they had a reasonably stable environment and an assured income, it would be fine to say, `We will depreciate this over 20 or 30 years', or whatever it is. But, of course, the problem is that they make this expenditure and they set aside this plant and equipment because they cannot rely on next year's income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it seems totally ludicrous to say to farmers, `Go and become self-reliant, go and store fodder or make water storage facilities available on your farm, but you are going to have to write off the cost over a protracted number of years'. It may be, for example, that a farmer puts up a hay shed and the very next year there is a drought, he has a negative income, and that depreciation arrangement is of no use at all. We should be encouraging farmers to become self-reliant and that means that they have to have a sufficient incentive to do so. I do not believe that the system we have at the moment is at all adequate. I believe that accelerated depreciation of the necessary precautions against a drought in terms of fodder and water conservation are absolutely critical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers from one end of Queensland to the other say to me that they need a fair dinkum IED scheme. We did have a fair dinkum IED scheme under the last coalition government; it was an excellent scheme. I repeat the comment of Mr James O'Shannessy, Deputy Chairman of the Bourke Rural Lands Protection Board, who told the Committee:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The income equalisation scheme&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I assume he means the old one&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was a great system, I thought and I think most graziers will agree with me. It allowed self-help. It allowed people to make provisions for the next drought. I would strongly recommend. . . that it be changed back to what it was. . .</PARA>
<PARA>The problem with the IED scheme as it exists at the moment is that there is a big tax penalty on money that farmers put away in the scheme. Farmers say, `Why should we put money away? The first $39,000 of that is going to be subject to taxation, yet I am not really getting the benefit of it in this year or any of the years in which it has been put in the IED'. It should not be taxed in that fashion. I do not think that that is a reasonable thing. The farmer is being told, `Put the money away, but pay us tax on it out of your other money anyway. We believe that is sufficient incentive for you to put that money away to protect against drought'. Of course it is not, and it never will be. We need much more flexibility and an understanding of the real financial pressure that many farm families are under at the moment&mdash;not just now but for many years to come&mdash;because of the high interest rates and low rainfall that they have suffered. It will take our farming community many years to get out of their current difficulties, and I think the Government has to recognise this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other countries, as honourable senators would know, governments are much more generous. We have a lot of competition with Canada in the areas of wheat, beef, pork production and so on. Farmers there have a marvellous scheme where they can basically quarantine in a very generous IED scheme a portion of their income every year and the Canadian Government matches it dollar for dollar. So for every $1 they put in the scheme the Canadian Government matches it with another $1, and when their income falls below a certain level they can draw down on all of those funds. We are not asking the Australian Government to be as generous as that, and I do not think many farmers in this country really want to receive subsidies and handouts&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Calvert has said, they have said that. They do not want to receive subsidies and handouts, but what they do want is a fair go. This Government has to recognise that this penny pinching in the taxation of the IED scheme does the farmers no good at all. In fact, because it degrades the long term viability of the farm sector, it impedes farmers from earning a generous income in the good years. It lowers the tax revenue to the Commonwealth by doing the things that it has done. We do not support tax evasion, but we do support giving industries an incentive to look after themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I make is that, no matter how self-reliant people become, there will always be exceedingly bad years. We believe that, just as flood is provided for in the national disaster relief arrangements, so too should drought be provided for. It is the opposite side of the coin: a flood is too much water, a drought is not enough water, and they should be treated equally. Unless the Government embarks on widespread irrigation programs&mdash;for example, the Bradford scheme in north Queensland to take the water across to the northern Downs&mdash;and provides that infrastructure, which will mean that people will not be affected by drought, severe drought will be a problem, no matter how self-reliant people try to become. Therefore, it stands to reason that the Government has a very clear obligation to make provision for that under the national disaster relief arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These matters are of considerable significance. I am grateful to the Senate for making time available to address these matters tonight. The Government and the Senate need to take a long, hard look at drought and not just assume that it can be solved in a matter of months, or even a matter of years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to give a brief report to the Senate on a recent trip I took on behalf of the Government to Africa. I was asked to lead the Australian Government delegation to SADCC, the Southern African Development Coordination Conference, that was this year held in Maputo, Mozambique. I had the opportunity to give the speech on behalf of Australia at that conference. I make three points. The first is that the Australian Government supported SADCC and congratulated it on its achievements so far towards the integration of the 10 countries that now constitute SADCC for the purposes of trading as a bloc and developing more efficient and rational transport arrangements, energy supply, and also the preparation for the acceptance of the membership of South Africa once full democracy and the end of apartheid is achieved in that country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we were very much in sympathy with the SADCC countries as a trading bloc because they, as has Australia, have suffered the effects of trade subsidies imposed by the European Community, Japan and the USA. Thirdly, I stress the point that continuing to ignore the particular poverty that is the lot of women is unjust. It is also economically unsound to leave women in a state of illiteracy, with poor health and insufficient provision for care during pregnancy and childbirth. It is a matter of absolute profligacy to waste all that talent. To chase good money after bad in a catch-up program of a minimum sort seemed to me to be worthy of comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our report was favourably received and we had a number of people from other countries wanting to speak to our delegation about assistance that Australia might offer. It is important to note for the record that Australia is very well received in Africa, certainly in all the countries to which I have ever been&mdash;and this time around in Zimbabwe, Mozambique and South Africa around Johannesburg and Pretoria where they thought Australia was a good country to come from. They liked Australia and appreciated very much our contribution there. However, there was some qualification to that praise when it came to South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was able to visit aid projects that Australia and World Vision are implementing in Zimbabwe. In particular, I was interested in them both from the position of being a member of a government that has aid projects there and because of my background as a doctor. Those projects are providing primary health care in community health centres of a sort that most Australians would not recognise, although perhaps some Aboriginal communities would feel that the circumstances were somewhat similar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly interested to note that, when it came to weighing babies, scales were tied to a tree. Babies were then placed in a sling which was hung from a hook on the scales. Older children were taught the trick of holding on to the hook underneath the scales and taking their feet off the ground. So the primary health care is certainly primary. But, of course, it provided the necessary information about weight gain in little babes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health workers are trained to help mothers to record the weights, to see that the babies are adequately nourished. They were also taught how to hydrate babies, particularly the simple method of using hydration fluid. Babies received their inoculations against childhood diseases and the mothers received contraception advice, a supply of the pill if they needed it or injections of depo-provera if they chose it. Condoms were available, but there was not a very large demand for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention these things because they relate to two of the major problems confronting Africa and the challenges that country has in dealing with them. Firstly, countries that are very poor and are struggling to feed their people need to look seriously at population control programs. But this is a very awkward and difficult area. So by and large these matters are left to health care workers and, in particular, to the mothers themselves. Therefore, this leads to an insufficient provision of care and service in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the mothers who are choosing contraception from either the pill or the depo-provera injection are not being provided with the contraceptive cover that allows them to practise safe sex. So the very benefits of contraception are also contributing to the potential for the spread of AIDS. In Africa, AIDS is a very major problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures that I was given on AIDS in Africa are not just frightening; they are devastating. As I recollect, 10 million people of a population of some 500 million people in south Saharan Africa are HIV positive. One person in 50 of the population is HIV positive. The rest of the world has not quite grasped the consequences of those figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I spoke with some representatives from World Vision who have also worked in Africa. They spoke of communities and villages that are now abandoned. The only people left alive in them are grandparents and tiny babes. The generations in between are now all dead. They are not just sick; they have already died and are wiped out. We have not begun to understand just how devastating this huge disease is in Africa. It will only get worse and it will only spread further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem of AIDS in Africa is different from country to country. The figures are very horrific and very large. When I visited the Deputy Minister for Health in Mozambique I was told that there are 1,200 new cases of AIDS per annum per one million of the population in Uganda compared with 1,000 in Kenya and about 1,000 in Malawi. Curiously, 200 is the comparable figure in Mozambique. The figure is low in Mozambique because of the bizarre benefit of war. The chronic war in Mozambique has prevented the ordinary communication, relationships and travel of people, so the number of AIDS cases there is actually lower at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But 1.2 million Mozambique people are living across the border in Malawi, which has a very high percentage of the population with AIDS. Many of those people are said to be HIV positive and, when the war is over, they will return to Mozambique. So the effect there will also be very devastating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Johannesburg I met some health officials and discovered that AIDS is a very significant problem in South Africa. In the black community it is a heterosexual disease; in the white community it is a homosexual disease. This means that we do not yet know a sufficient amount about the spread of the HIV disease. We do know that it is transmitted by sex, be it by homosexual or heterosexual practitioners; that it is spread by blood transfusion; and that it is spread by the use of shared needles. Also, rather horrifically, it is spread during pregnancy from parent to child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those means of transmission are significant in Africa. It is something that is beginning to be treated as seriously as those numbers indicate it ought be. In fact, one thing that is most impressive is the effectiveness of the Australian treatment and management of AIDS. There is no cure for this disease. The only way it can be managed is by proper community education and the proper living practices so that its spread is minimised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian experience is now recognised worldwide for the effective program that it is. Indeed, we have been able to offer that kind of information and assistance to other countries. One aid program that I was told about but was not able to visit was in Zambia where Australians are working with the Salvation Army in a very successful AIDS program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very shocked the other day to read the remarks of Professor Hollows. He mentioned the word `quarantine'. He suggested that, as a means of protecting people who are at the moment free of the disease, we should quarantine them. It is far more important to give people information than to isolate them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Ugandan woman called Noerine Kaleeba has written a very beautiful book, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">We Miss You All</EMPHASIS>, about the effect of AIDS in Uganda and what happens to families when two, three, four or five members die of AIDS. We are now not talking about an isolated case here or there or a small pocket of the community but rather a very devastating epidemic. The cry from her book and the people who spoke to me is, `Please do not isolate people. Give us the information so that we can use it to live safely and constructively with AIDS or with HIV positive people so that they are not isolated'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very worst thing she says in her book&mdash;and others have told me this&mdash;is that people who are HIV positive or who are suffering from AIDS find themselves isolated and abandoned by their communities. Certainly for those who are HIV positive and certainly for those with AIDS, and also for people who are at risk but are not yet HIV positive, it is far more important that we do not practice the ostrich syndrome of putting our head in the sand and isolating or quarantining people. It is far more important that we learn the facts about the spread of AIDS and learn to live successfully with it so that it is not spread. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the evidence one can take from Australia. We are one of the most successful countries in restricting the spread and the increased number of cases. Africa is very interested in our successes and has made its own plea for information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visit to Mozambique also gave me the opportunity of seeing the variety of ways in which Australian aid is provided. Some of it is development aid very much at the grassroots level. For example, I visited a covered well of clean water that Australian aid has provided in a Julius Nyerere village in Xaixai, a northern province. It was very pleasing to visit that community and see how appreciated something as small as a covered well water supply was by the community and what assistance it provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also visited Mozambique Telecommunications which is working with Australian Telecom to provide telecommunications in the northern province. Commodities assistance is a very successful different type of aid exchange program whereby expertise and equipment from Australian Telecom is being provided to Mozambique Telecommunications, which is very much appreciative of that effort. It is also interesting because Australia has to deal with exactly the same sorts of problems of great distance, significant temperature differences, drought, flood and fire&mdash;the sorts of things that make for specific requirements even in a telecommunications system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all three countries I was delighted to meet at every opportunity with women's organisations and appreciate the hunger of women for information and their appreciation of support, wherever it may come from, but particularly their appreciation of belonging to an international network of women&mdash;women who are aware of the problems that are specific to countries and those that are general. I found myself made very welcome amongst the groups of women and I was very appreciative of their hospitality. People who have nothing often have a great generosity and certainly these folk made me very welcome indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the projects that I found interesting was a kind of aid project. I am not exactly sure of the channels by which the money gets there, but I think the Australian Commonwealth is providing assistance for the new multi-party elections in Mozambique. I believe Mr Colin Ball from Tasmania is in Mozambique at the moment assisting with this stage of preparing for the multi-party election&mdash;looking at the requirements in terms of cubicles, the ways in which to get the names of people, identifying who the people in the community are, how many there are, and so on, and what will be the cost of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I subsequently met a very new women's group called Women in Law and Development. While I wanted to ask them all sorts of things about what life was like for them in Mozambique, I found that they really wanted to ask me many questions about what it is like to be in a parliament that has more than one party. In particular, I was rather charmed by these questions: how do you all get on in the one room? What does an opposition do to the government?'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think they were more concerned at the way people who have been at war might actually co-exist in the same room. It is very interesting to meet people who are asking questions that level: please tell us what it would be like? How do you have a for and against in the one room?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The women were concerned, too, because of the massive problem of illiteracy amongst women. How on earth can one talk about having an election when people in huge numbers are unable to read?  In what way does one guarantee that those people have their rights?  Again, they were very interested to hear from me what little I could tell them of the experience we have had of trying to inform Aboriginal people in this community&mdash;the Electoral Commission's efforts to send teams out to Aboriginal communities to tell them what their rights are and how to be involved in elections; what that power means to them, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I simply say a few words about the time in South Africa. It is sobering to go to Johannesburg and Pretoria or, more particularly, to leave the white cities and go to the townships. I spent some time in Soweto, in Katlahong and Soshanguve. The townships were shocking in the mile upon mile of grossly insufficient housing. We were able, after we had asked whether we could, to visit with a family in what most of us would call an insufficient description of a garage: a galvanised iron shed, the roof held on by rocks and the ceiling but six feet high. If one put two single beds in the room, one would be out the front door. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The place was immaculately clean. Each day this lady made sure that her house was tidy and in order. There was no water; standpipes were some many yards or kilometres away; water has to be carried, as African women are good at doing, on their heads; and of course there was no sewerage. This, for mile after mile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Johannesburg and Soweto there were huge slag heaps within cooee of the townships. I was interested, when visiting the hospital nearby, to ask the doctors what was in the dust. One doctor said, `It's just dust, you don't have to worry about it'. Another doctor said, with remarkable honesty, `It's from the mines; it's full of cyanide'. That dust blows so that we could hardly see trees across the ground&mdash;dust which is full of cyanide that was falling on those people day after day. It is just a little extra that they had added to their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The poverty there was extraordinary. Another reason why I was pleased to go was because there are a number of APHEDA projects funded to some of those townships. One was a creche and another a pre-school centre that was going to open the next day. The walls were built and the ceiling was being put on that afternoon or evening. Again, apart from water, housing and sewerage, the principal request for black people in South Africa was for education&mdash;education that has been denied them under the Bantu education system. I was advised that that Bantu education system will ensure that whenever democracy comes to South Africa apartheid will continue for at least 20 years but, more realistically, 40 years, as the people who are insufficiently educated wash through the system and a new generation of people, hopefully better educated, come into the system. The need for education is critical at all levels. The programs are aimed at the moment to start the education system with children at the beginning of school, so that they at least can expect to leave school with an adequate and comprehensive education. </PARA>

That fits very nicely alongside a recent allocation of $100,000 from the Australian Government to the Australian Embassy in South Africa also to assist with sport.

The women I met certainly indicate that, despite those crushing burdens of poverty and chronic insufficient services, care, food, et cetera, they still have an optimism, they still have an energy and they are still prepared to keep trying.

I was somewhat surprised when Walter Sisulu said to me, `You know, you are the first politician, Senator, who's ever raised the question of women with me'. I believe that that is something I will want to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) about so that again and again we will see that women are legitimately part of any international discussions and that they are on the agenda.

It was interesting to discover his changed status. Joe Thwaites and his wife Anne Lorne were both of great assistance. I also thank the second secretary, Dr Neshateckle, an extraordinary woman with her capacity not only to speak the languages of the country, in particular Portuguese, which is of great help in Mozambique, but her huge network of contacts. I was able to visit hospitals, women's organisations, projects and so on in a way that may not otherwise have been possible. I give thanks to all those people who assisted me.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. My concern is that for real people the Government, probably through the work of the bureaucracy, has lost sight of the problem. Too often policies are devised to fit a particular monetary or fiscal result and do not really address the problems of people. The policy is program driven and not needs driven. That would be all right if it were not for the enormous human cost of running programs in that way. Senator Button made some comments about the dangers of being enmeshed in the Canberra bureaucracy. I think we have a problem in that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people are struggling under a financial disability as a result of the legacy of the Government's high interest policy, the recession, commodity price crashes or drought, they need help. The problem is that they do not get it. Instead, they are thrown into bureaucratic red tape, frustration and ultimately humiliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall take the case of Mr and Mrs N, as I shall refer to them, who are cane farmers on the mid-north coast of Queensland in Mr Courtice's electorate of Hinkler. Mrs N is on the old age pension, which on 10 October 1991 was assessed at $131.60 a week. Like many cane farmers in Queensland, they are suffering severe financial problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the financial year ending June 1992, according to an estimated profit and loss statement from their accountants which has been submitted to the Department of Social Security, there will be a total income for the year of $5,892. The problem is that of that income of $5,892 their farming enterprise shows a loss of $1,573. There is $300 in bank interest, wages of $500, an accident insurance claim of $1,250, and most significantly a QIDC household support assistance payment from 1 October 1991 to 30 June 1992 of $5,415, making a grand total of $5,892. That is all the money the couple will have for this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr and Mrs N sought financial assistance through the QIDC, and on 17 October 1991 the QIDC advised Mr and Mrs N that $1,805 was approved for household assistance support to cover the period from 1 October 1991 to 31 December 1991. It advised that the assistance was available in quarterly advances for an initial period of six months. I make it clear that this funding is provided to alleviate financial hardship while the people concerned face the decision of whether to adjust out of primary production and sell their property. After this period, if the people decide to retain their property, the assistance provided converts to a loan, with interest charged at commercial rates repayable over seven years. Therefore, there is no guarantee that it is income; it could be a loan if they decide to stay on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meanwhile, back at the Department of Social Security, Mrs N, as is required, has advised the Department that they will be receiving $1,805 in household support assistance and that the support was available for six months&mdash;they had received it for a period of three months. The Department of Social Security got out its calculator and worked out that Mr and Mrs N would receive income of $1,805 multiplied by four&mdash;a sum of $7,220 until June 1992. Clearly that cannot be the case because even if the assistance were to run for the whole period through to the end of June 1992, they could still get only three quarters of that, but that is the Department's logic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 22 November Mr N received a letter from the Department of Social Security saying in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Due to a change in your circumstances your pension has been reviewed and altered. . .  Your fortnightly rate will be. . . $19.00. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That represents a fall of 85 per cent, or $112 a fortnight, which is really quite shocking for people who are in a grave financial position. I cannot understand, and would be grateful if someone could tell me, how the Department of Social Security can arrive at an 85 per cent cut in pension for people who almost literally have the backside out of their trousers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DSS decided that the QIDC household support would be to June 1992&mdash;$1,805 multiplied by four, or, as I said, $7,220. The Department said that interest would be $108 and&mdash;I ask the Senate to listen to this&mdash;that Mr and Mrs N would have a farm income of $20,020. The reality is that they will have a farm loss of $1,573, which is the estimated figure. The Department also estimated that accident insurance would be worth $1,440 and wages $500, making a total of $29,288. In the words of the Dickensian character Mr Micawber, that result would be bliss if it were true. If it were true, these people would not be bothered with the Department of Social Security in the first place. Something is severely wrong. As the Senate will recall, Mr and Mrs N's accountant estimated their annual income for this financial year to be $5,892, made up of $5,415 principally of QIDC household support. Again in the words of Mr Micawber, the result is penury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs N talked to the Department of Social Security about this, but to no avail. Therefore, on 14 January 1991 their accountant wrote to the regional manager pointing out that the purpose of the QIDC assistance was to tide them over until their farm was sold or, if it were not sold within two years, the money advanced would be regarded as a loan. There are clear grounds for making some sort of adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA>The accountant explained that this assistance was not income and submitted Mr and Mrs N's estimated profit and loss statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To cut a long story short, seven weeks later the Department of Social Security regional office has not responded, the result being that out there is one very unhappy and financially stressed couple, one of whom is on an old age pension, trying to battle red tape, bureaucrats and government policy, trying to make a living and adjust their lifestyle and their farm. The question I ask is simply this: why is this office taking such a long time to reply? Why are people being put through financial agony by the Department of Social Security for seven weeks? It seems to me that it is all too hard, that it has gone into the too-hard basket because it would appear that there is no policy to cover it. If that is the case, that is unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are thousands of Mr and Mrs Ns in Australia at the moment who are being crushed into the ground by just such uncaring policies. There is either no heart left in the Government or there is no heart left in the bureaucracy. The Government is turning into a giant machine which is crushing the spirit out of people. It draws its harvest from ruthless plantings of policy, recession and high interest rates. Unfortunately, the crop from those plantings is far too good. </PARA>

Senator Parer is entitled to his views. He believes that money should be spent in north Queensland&mdash;his State, I remind people; anyone listening might not realise, from the way he was talking this afternoon, that he is a Queensland senator. Senator Parer is entitled to his views, but he is not entitled to misrepresent the character and motives of two people he has probably never met.

But that is not easy for many ordinary Australian citizens unless they know that that procedure is available.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In recent days we have seen the Government solving the crisis in youth unemployment by pretending that there is not one. It has been coming out with invented figures which, as has been pointed out in this place, are totally mischievous, totally dishonest and totally deceptive&mdash;claiming, for example, that the real measure of youth unemployment is not as a percentage of the work force but as a percentage of the population. We all know that is absolute nonsense. The real measure is the number of people looking for jobs. If the Government is going to apply this new criteria, I wonder why it has not applied that percentage to the adult unemployed. There is exactly the same proportion of adults out of the work force as there are 15- to 19-year-old young people out of the work force. The percentage for adults is about 52 per cent and for 15- to 19-year-olds it is about 60 per cent. That dishonesty is exposed as absolute total nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the adult work force, it would be just as rational to include in the work force as the measure all retired people and all wives who do not work if you are going to include all young people who are at school and not seeking a job. The irrationality of the Government's position is self-evident. But now we come to a greater dishonesty in the Government's position. Mr Beazley, who is now Minister for Employment, Education and Training, is so ill-informed in this matter that he said on the Richard Palfreyman radio program `The World Today':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Youth rates of unemployment are high, that is true, but compared to the 1982-83 recession there are far fewer young people actually looking for work; about 450,000 back in 1982-83. The number is now 290,000.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he was suggesting to the listeners that there had been a dramatic cut of 145,200 in the number of young Australians looking for jobs. That is totally false. Maybe it is only incompetence that led him to that because the figures he quoted are exactly the figures of the number of young Australians in full time work. It is true that back in 1983 in that recession there were 450,000 young Australians in full time jobs. There are now only 290,000 in full time jobs. His figures are exactly right for the wrong matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those figures reflect the number of jobs wiped out. One in every three full time youth jobs has been wiped out since the 1983-84 recession. Yet Mr Beazley got on radio and quoted those figures of the jobs wiped out. Wrongly and incompetently, he referred to them as the number of young people actually looking for work. For his information, let us get the facts straight&mdash;and let us hear him apologise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that the total number of 15- to 19-year-olds unemployed&mdash;that includes people looking for full time and part time jobs&mdash;in January 1984, at the peak of the recession, was 222,100. It is now 218,100&mdash;roughly in line, except that there were more people in the work force then. So the unemployment rate among 15- to 19-year-olds in 1984 was 26.9 per cent and the unemployment rate now is 27.3 per cent, the worst on record. They are the actual figures, if Mr Beazley wants to know the facts, and that is taking part timers as well as full timers. Of course, if we take the proper measure of youth unemployment, which is the full time unemployment rate, it is now 34.8 per cent compared to 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On every honest measure, youth unemployment now is worse than it was in the last recession, and for Mr Beazley to come out pretending that there had been a drop of 150,000 in the number of young people looking for work when in fact it was a drop of 150,000 in the number of young people at work indicates either a massive desire to pretend that the problem does not exist, to talk it out of existence, or a massive incompetence in being able to read the unemployment statistics. Whatever it is, it explains clearly why this Government has done absolutely nothing to resolve the crisis of youth unemployment. All it has done is try to invent figures to pretend that the problem does not exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the young people of Australia received nothing in this One Nation program&mdash;nothing but an admission that the job training schemes had been failures. Three of them are being quietly closed down and the funds diverted into a repackaged version of the same sort of thing. This Government has the hide to come into this chamber and accuse me of retailing misleading statistics when they are in fact from the Australian Bureau of Statistics labour force survey. The only people misleading the Parliament and Australia on the level of youth unemployment are in this Government. If they are going to do anything about it, it would be a nice idea if they tried to fix the problem, not just fiddle the figures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;We have had a number of speakers on the adjournment tonight. Senator Crowley spoke about her experiences in Africa, which was informative. Senator O'Chee raised a matter in the nature of a grievance. Senator Reynolds did the same about the naming of people who are not members of this place and are unable to defend themselves when they and their reputations are criticised. Senator Parer replied to those allegations, although, I might say, quite limply and ineffectually. Senator Michael Baume rose on the subject of youth unemployment. I do not intend to comment on all of the speakers, but I cannot allow the adjournment debate to be completed without a remark or two in reply to what Senator Michael Baume has said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing that might be said about Senator Baume's remarks is: why does he bother? Why does he bother to propound a fallacy so consistently unless he believes that by continuous repetition he can sometimes change reality? What Senator Baume has done here tonight is what he has done on a number of other occasions. Words like `dishonesty' and `misleading' trip very lightly and easily from his tongue. I suggest anyone interested in this subject should in fact look at the truth of the circumstances and come to a conclusion. Senator Baume put out a press release the other week in which he said that one in three young Australians was unemployed. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no explanation because the proposition is patently nonsense. The reason Senator Baume is so sensitive about the matter is that he knows that in his heart of hearts, and he resents the idea that someone has identified that he has been caught out on this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation with youth unemployment is of course different from the situation of adult unemployment. The reason for that is that the labour market for young people is a different labour market in character and nature than the adult labour market. Young people are traditionally between the ages of 15 and 19 and are not married with families; therefore, one does not find the lack of participation in the work force that there is amongst adults because they have family responsibilities or other duties. So the test about family or domestic responsibilities does not apply to this group in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other notable thing that does not apply to this group in the work force is that a huge number of people in this age group are in education or training. In fact, the most significant element of education and training is that in the nine years of this Government&mdash;and today I think is the celebration of the ninth year of the election of the Hawke Labor Government in 1983&mdash;the retention rate for year 12 students has doubled. That is quite a significant achievement. It is also true that during this time in approximate terms real expenditure has increased in real terms. I cannot be absolutely sure about this figure, but the figure I have in mind&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I will not invent one. It is about 40 per cent or more; I am being modest. It represents a huge commitment to education under this Government and a huge boost in opportunity for young people to remain in the education system. If one looks at the youth labor market, in rough order the figure is one in 10. About seven of the 10 young people are in education or training of some sort; the other three are in the labour market. One of those three is unemployed. That is the true context in which this occurs. To run around with headlines about one in three is, of course, ridiculous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other characteristic about youth unemployment is that there is a tendency in this age structure for young people to dip in and out of the labour force, to transfer between working and training and back again. Another feature about this age group is that these people tend to be placed much quicker than other age groups. So we are not looking here at an in-built group which is long term unemployed; we are looking at a group of people who move around in employment much more quickly. The great feature of what this Government has done is its commitment to training and education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The huge feature of the One Nation statement is, of course, the commitment of an extra $720m towards TAFE training. This Government is concerned that the funds spent on education have meant that the technical training and TAFE sector is out of balance with the tertiary and education sector and that there is now a need to commit funds to that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The innovation in the One Nation statement is to do this in cooperation with the States on a national scale in order to bring opportunities for technical training back into focus. That is, I think, one of the most positive commitments any government can make to the question of employment opportunities for young people. Those who have the better skills are the ones who are likely to be placed. As the recovery takes place with greater force during the course of this year, employment opportunities in real careers will be opened for them. This training that they now have access to will stand them in good stead for those careers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That commitment ought to be compared with the proposition in the so-called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document, the Hewson consumption tax package, which alters some of the labour market programs in a way in which the victims get blamed and the cost is borne by them. In fact, Austrain, which is supposed to be a labour market support program under the Hewson consumption tax package, is best named, as it has been called now, `Austslave'. It means that people who are employed under this program, should it ever take root, will work at 80 per cent of the award rate. That means that a pool of low-wage labour, able to displace existing labour without creating additional spots, will be created. The cost of bidding wages down across the board will be borne by those people who are wage earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think all of those features are enough for any reasonable person to conclude that if it comes to a debate about youth unemployment in this country and a credential contest to see who has the right to claim the mantle as the party of greater concern, that mantle unquestionably and undoubtedly goes to the Government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">``The Commissioner of Taxation advised that the secrecy provisions of the income tax law prevent him from specifically answering questions (1), (2) and (3).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Taxation Ruling IT 2255, which issued on 27 February 1986, explains the Commissioner's view of the law in this area. A specific provision (section 26AD) of the income tax law includes in a taxpayer's assessable income amounts paid in respect of accrued and pro-rata long service leave to which a taxpayer is entitled. Such income is subject to a maximum rate of tax of 30%.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions, however, only apply to pro rata long service leave payments if there is some formal arrangement for the making of the payment. A gratuitous payment to a terminating employee, calculated on a basis similar to that for ordinary long service leave entitlements, is not sufficient. That is the case whether the payment is a payment to an employee who has not qualified for any long service leave entitlement or is an additional payment calculated by reference to the employee's ordinary long service leave entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a gratuitous termination payment is an eligible termination payment. Where such a payment is an approved early retirement scheme payment or a bona fide redundancy payment it may qualify for concessional taxing treatment. That is, only 5 per cent of any amount (not including forgone superannuation benefits) in excess of what the taxpayer would have been entitled to on voluntary retirement is included in assessable income and taxed at marginal rates. The tax law does not discriminate in this respect between a taxpayer receiving a redundancy package or a taxpayer retiring early under an approved early retirement scheme.''</PARA>
