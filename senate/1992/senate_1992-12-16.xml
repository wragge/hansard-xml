<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Report</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matter addressed in the report I have just tabled was referred to the Committee in June this year. Since that date we have received 112 submissions and held public hearings in five States and the ACT covering urban, regional and rural centres. In addition, individual Committee members have talked to a large number of young unemployed people, youth workers, teachers and counsellors as well as employers, trade unionists, government officials and academics throughout the country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to emphasise at the outset the Committee's unanimous endorsement of the Report's recommendations. Such agreement is perhaps surprising given the highly political nature of unemployment issues. It has been achieved because each individual member of the Committee has recognised that the future of our young people will not be secured by slogans or political grandstanding. It is a serious issue which demands non-partisan responses. Committee members acknowledge that there is no single solution to the complex problem of youth unemployment and that any approach which is to have a hope of succeeding will need to transcend party political considerations and draw upon the goodwill and resolve of all sectors of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Youth unemployment is everybody's problem. It is the Committee's hope that this Report will serve both to emphasis this perspective and to suggest practical means by which the worst features of the impact of sustained unemployment might be alleviated. We stress this, given that a more permanent solution, in the form of full employment, is unlikely to be achieved in the short or medium term.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There can be hardly a family in Australia today that is not affected in some way by youth unemployment. Although concentrated among disadvantaged groups, youth unemployment is by no means confined to them. It affects people from all social and economic backgrounds and from all regions of the country. It afflicts people with PhDs and those who are illiterate. Their numbers are growing, as is the length of their unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because today almost everybody knows a young unemployed person, most people also realise that the term "dole bludger" is now wholly unacceptable. The community seems generally now to recognise that most unemployed young people are eager to work and that many are making tremendous efforts to do so. The Committee was heartened by the resilience and energy of many of the young unemployed people it met during the course of this Inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would also like to pay tribute here to the efforts of many individuals&mdash;parents, employers, teachers and landladies among others&mdash;who have recognised the plight of young unemployed people and are doing what they can to alleviate individual cases of hardship. The Parliament and the community generally would do well to reflect that, were it not for their generosity, the costs of youth unemployment, both to the individuals concerned and to the community generally, would be even greater. We should note here that the cost of unemployment generally is currently running at around $20 billion per year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before turning to our recommendations it is important to stress that the Committee does not wish to suggest that the personal consequences of unemployment are any less tragic for mature aged people than for young people. Our focus on young people is dictated by our terms of reference. As well, we are acutely aware of the potentially disastrous impact on our society of a sizeable group of alienated young people who have never worked and perhaps will never have the opportunity of doing so. They are cut off from the benefits bestowed by full time jobs and lack any commitment to the values espoused by mainstream society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our recommendations are based on the assumption that unemployment levels will remain high in the medium term and that, as the causes of youth unemployment are so complex and intractable in the prevailing economic situation, a range of approaches is required. The recommendations are focused around three main approaches.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first relates to income support. Current income support arrangements have grown out of policies developed at a time of high employment. They were designed to assist small numbers of people for short periods as they moved between jobs. These arrangements are inappropriate for current conditions. While efforts have been made to modify income support arrangements in recent years, they remain complex, and often unnecessarily punitive and demeaning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended a number of changes designed to reduce their complexity. These include: the centralisation of income support arrangements in one department; the coalescing of all income support payments for eligible young people into a unified youth payment and simplification of the eligibility criteria for independent Austudy. In recognition of the need for a less punitive approach to the payment of income support the Committee has recommended that waiting periods for benefits be reduced; that greater flexibility be introduced into activity/work tests; that the "free area" of income which beneficiaries are allowed to earn before losing benefits is extended and that income support levels are increased to the revised Henderson Poverty Line in the first instance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our second group of recommendations relates to job creation. These recommendations are based on the view that we need a more creative and visionary approach to this task than has been evident in attempts to date and that we should build upon community concern and goodwill. We have recommended therefore that: employers should be assisted to take on additional employees through a 150% tax deduction on wages, replacing existing wage subsidy schemes; the establishment of a national employment corps, funded by the Commonwealth and the States and managed at local or regional level; that strategies be developed for the rapid expansion of job sharing and other proposals geared to a broader distribution of available work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, our Report discusses at some length the link between employment and training. While generally supportive of Carmichael and other proposals relating to vocational education and training the Committee is mindful of the fact that these proposals assume the availability of jobs (the so-called labour market entry points) so that proper, work-based training can be implemented. No attention has been paid to that significant group who will be unable to obtain jobs and thus will be denied opportunities also to participate in further training. Our recommendations are directed to addressing this discrepancy and to supporting and extending existing programs for enhancing links between schools and the work place. A national, competency-based approach to training is desirable, but the complexities of its implementation are considerable, and the Committee is not convinced that the implications for resources and coordination have been fully thought out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I conclude, on behalf of the Committee, with an affirmation of the value of all of our young people. We believe that they all have something to contribute. If they are denied the opportunity to do so our society will be poorer for it, and ultimately we all will feel the consequences of this neglect.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendment in the Bill to the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991 seeks to reimpose the blackout on television and radio advertising three days before an election campaign. When the Government introduced its ill-fated ban on political broadcasts and advertising, one of the consequences of that Bill was that it removed all the bans on advertising by reimposing a total advertising ban. I suppose one could call it yet another unintended consequence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Political Broadcasts Bill was subject to a High Court challenge. The High Court struck down, or found invalid, the ban on political advertising. The Bill was opposed very strenuously by the Opposition because we took the view that it was an unprecedented attack on freedom of speech and freedom of political expression in Australia. As I indicated, the High Court struck down this attempt to attack freedom of speech. The Government has had to bring in legislation that reimposes the three-day blackout. As a matter of principle, the Opposition will oppose this amendment to the Special Broadcasting Service Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to go on. This issue was canvassed very strongly over the last 12 months and we have had the decision from the High Court. The question that should be asked of the Minister is: in view of the High Court decision, does he have an opinion that this amendment is valid? If so, could the chamber have a copy of that opinion? If not, should we be passing a Bill which could again be subject to a High Court challenge and which will yet again be found to be invalid?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the High Court case referred to by Senator Parer, known as the political broadcast case, the High Court held that there is a freedom of communication in relation to political matters inherent in the Constitution and based on the Constitution's establishment of a system of representative democracy. However, all of the Justices who recognised the existence of this implied freedom also recognised that the freedom was not absolute and could be restricted to the extent that other legitimate public interests required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three day broadcasting blackout has been in place under Commonwealth legislation for many years&mdash;in fact, 50 years&mdash;and has operated as an unchallenged element of representative democracy without compromising the system of government. It has enjoyed bipartisan support as being a sensible relief from the jingles, for at least a couple of days before polling day, for half a century. I must say that in my early discussions with senior members of the coalition, they indicated to me that they had no difficulty at all in supporting the return of the ban. For an early form of the ban, I would refer senators to section 89 of the Australian Broadcasting Act 1942, that is Act No. 33 of 1942. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the Government's view that the blackout period performs a useful function, as I have just said, in enabling electors to decide upon their votes in the last two days before polling day without being bombarded by electronic media advertising. It is certainly my experience that at that stage of the campaign most people in the electorate loathe it, and love to see the end of it, rather than its enhancing representative democracy by allowing the electorate to be misled when there is then very little time for any response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the legislation would clearly be a restriction on the freedom of communication on political matters, in the  Government's view the blackout period serves a legitimate public purpose in the manner in which the High Court described it. It is non-discriminatory in its application and it is of a very limited duration. In my view, and I have no hesitation in saying this, it is a very minor restriction on television electronic political advertising, which the majority of Australians would not only be comfortable with but also, at that stage of an election campaign, would support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer asked whether the Government had sought legal advice on this. Yes, of course the Government has. The advice that the Government has received from the Attorney-General's Department is that this legislation is legally sound and would have a very good chance of success, which is as strongly put as I imagine any wise counsel would put it, if it were put under challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Parer asked me for my opinion, I would say that I am not a lawyer, thank God, but I was interested enough to read the judgments in this case. Personally, I was comfortable with the High Court's interesting exercise of drawing lines in the sand, which is what it did in that very creative decision. The High Court found that there was an inherent right to freedom of speech in the Constitution and, in relation to that aspect of the case, it was a piece of creative law making, which I support. But the High Court did&mdash;and it acknowledged that it did&mdash;draw a line in the sand. It did not say that this was an absolute proscription; it said that further lines, I guess, could be drawn in the sand at future times if legislation were taken to the High Court as a challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For what it is worth&mdash;and it is worth nothing, because I am not a lawyer&mdash;from my own reading of the High Court's judgments I would say that this would have every chance of being upheld in the High Court as being constitutional. In direct response to Senator Parer's question, yes we have sought legal advice and the legal advice is to that effect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to respond briefly to one thing that Senator Parer said. I think there is an important distinction between this reinstatement of the status quo&mdash;and that is what it is&mdash;and the previous proposal. There is no question in terms of the previous proposal that there was a very strong motive on the part of the Government&mdash;and, frankly, I think a proper one&mdash;to try to remove the enormous burden of cost by way of a general electronic blackout. Television advertising, of course, doubles the cost of campaigns; as we all know, it is the single biggest component of any election campaign. The aim was to remove that enormous financial burden. There is no element of that in this amendment. This amendment purely and simply has nothing to do with saving even a few days advertising time.

<PARA>The majority of the amendments are minor technical matters. The substantive amendments relate to the new classification proposals. So these will be the only amendments that I will now address myself to for the sake of brevity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 24 November I announced the Government's intention to apply a uniform classification scheme to films televised by commercial and community broadcasters and to provide for restrictions on M and MA classified material. The proposed amendments result from extensive discussions with the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the Office of Film and Literature Classification and industry groups on the most effective way of giving effect to the Government's intention. I would like to thank the officers of all those organisations for the intense amount of effort that has been put in to present what I think is an extremely reasonable and balanced proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues raised are not simple. It is probably a common failing of most politicians, because it is inherent in the process, that we are always looking for simple solutions to complex problems. The issues here are not simple. No matter what one tries to do, one will never satisfy everybody. One can only try to provide a reasonable result that will satisfy reasonable people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After two all-night sessions in a row, this morning I particularly feel like poor old Sisyphus who had to roll a rock up a hill for the whole of his life. I feel condemned to debate this for my entire parliamentary career, and here we are again. I emphasise that these are not simple issues. Broadcasters have accepted the need for programs displaying the stronger forms of violence, sex and crude language to be shown after 9 p.m. and the codes they are currently developing will so provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The added factor in this debate was that it occurred at a time when the new Australian Broadcasting Authority had just been established and was operational and these codes were in the process of preparation. In fact, the main worry of the broadcasters was that they should retain the right to modify those programs further to ensure that they meet the stricter ideas of what should be shown on television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are proposing that the codes of practice should allow for modification of films to ensure that they at least meet the OFLC classifications for the time slots shown, knowing that in many cases the versions of films shown as M or MA on television will have been modified to remove scenes which would be acceptable to the Censor under the classification for cinema display. That is the current procedure and the television industry has been observing it for years. There is a very tiny percentage indeed of feature films classified under the film classifications as R that are ever modified for television. Indeed, they have to be heavily modified. The majority of those modified feature films would come from the M classification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coupled with improved consumer advice&mdash;which I am delighted to see in terms of the proposals which have come forward from the industry&mdash;the system will enable viewers, and particularly parents, to have a better idea of the content of films. They can be confident that films shown on television are at least within the OFLC guidelines for cinema display. I might also add that the research that has been done clearly shows that a very substantial number of people who watch television place high value on the assistance given to them by those classification symbols. One of the very positive things that has come out of this will be the enhanced regime that will be introduced by the broadcasters in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The restrictions will be imposed by codes of practice which must be developed within the framework of the Broadcasting Services Act. This amendment ensures that these codes apply the OFLC guidelines. The current provisions of the Act ensure that codes must take into account community attitudes to the portrayal of violence, sexual conduct and nudity, use of drugs and offensive language. The code dealing with the suitability of programs for broadcasting, the protection of children or the classification of programs which did not make adequate provision for these issues would not be registered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the chamber that under section 123 of the Act the ABA will only register a code if it is satisfied of three things: firstly, and most importantly, that the code `provides appropriate community safeguards for the matters covered by the code'; secondly, that the code is endorsed by a majority of the providers of broadcasting services in the relevant section of the industry, thus ensuring a commitment to the code by the broadcasters themselves&mdash;a very sensible provision&mdash;and, thirdly, that members of the public have had an adequate opportunity to comment on the code. This is no behind closed doors exercise, but a full, open and cooperative effort to protect important cultural values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators may also be assured that the standards of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal on programming classification and timing will still apply under the Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act until replaced. If they are not replaced by a code, they will be replaced by an ABA standard under section 125 of the Broadcasting Services Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC and SBS are not subject to the Broadcasting Services Act but are required by their own Acts to develop codes and notify them to the Australian Broadcasting Authority. The ABC code has been approved by its board and notified to the ABA, and the SBS board will consider a draft code on 19 December. Those codes will apply the OFLC guidelines. The ABA can deal with complaints about breaches of the Act of the ABC or SBS code. If a national broadcaster fails to implement recommendations made by the ABA within 30 days, the ABA may report that fact to the Minister who is obliged to table the report within seven sitting days in both Houses of Parliament. No further legislative sanctions are necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am convinced that these proposals will meet the legitimate concerns of senators while maintaining the flexibility essential to effective regulation of a diverse industry such as broadcasting. I must also say again that I have been pleased by the cooperative attitude of the broadcasters on this issue. The level of commitment they have displayed&mdash;perhaps reluctantly at certain times during this process; they certainly cooperated fully in attempting to work with the regulators to come up with what is now before the chamber&mdash;convinces me that we will have no problems in the actual broadcasting of M and MA material. I am particularly pleased to see the move taken in the split of the M classification into a far more sensible split and the enhanced provisions that will be made by the broadcasters to actually display for the benefit of the viewer far more detail about what will be contained in the program about to be shown. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for some explanation of the matters now before us. If we are dealing with the whole of the amendments, and I suppose we are, the recommendations relating to M and MA made by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in September 1992 state on page 23:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also a certain amount of confusion surrounding the AO (television) and M (cinema/video) classifications caused by the fact that the AO classification, designated as being for 18+ years, is more restrictive than for all but the mildest M classified films, which are designated for 15+ years.</PARA>
<PARA>The third paragraph down from that&mdash;and I do not miss out anything relevant&mdash;states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We propose that, for the purposes of television broadcasts of M classified material under self regulation, broadcasters adopt a system which splits the M classification into two categories, with milder material in the lower M range being equated to the current AO classification, and thus able to be shown from 8.30pm, and material in the M classification which includes stronger depictions of sex, violence or coarse language being restricted to broadcast in an unmodified form only after 10.30pm.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's amendments mean in effect that M material will be able to be shown after 8.30 p.m. and stronger material rated MA will be able to be shown after 9 p.m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand what will be in the M material. The ABT committee that dealt with this comprised Sue Brooks, Bruce Allen and David Haines from the OFLC. The words they use for AO make it more restrictive than all but the mildest M classified films which are designated for 15-plus. Is that statement correct?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the classifications; I have had a look at them and I have compared them. But I also have had a look at what the ABT has indicated and at the views of each of the television stations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer is categorically no. The points Senator Harradine raises are very valid. I am familiar with that original recommendation of the ABT, which we do not accept. We do not support it, and we did not then. Can I say for the advice of the chamber that suggestions were made during this process of negotiation that that could perhaps be reconsidered, and they were rejected. The Government expressed the very strong view to the industry that that would not be permitted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, what Senator Harradine has said is correct. Fundamentally, the proposal&mdash;and the word is `unmodified'&mdash;is that those classifications could be broadcast on free to air television at those later hours. So that, basically, after half past ten&mdash;whatever the hour was&mdash;it would be a case of letting it rip. One could have broadcast on free to air television the same material in most classifications unmodified on television that one could see at the cinema. That was not and is not accepted. Indeed, the Opposition's amendment, which the Government intends to support, moved by Senator Alston, reflects that. But so does the industry's letter which has just been tabled and which Senator Harradine has just seen. The answer to Senator Harradine's question is categorically no. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We understand that the Government proposes to introduce legislation to establish the framework for the revised program classification system agreed last month with the commercial television industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within that legislative framework, the industry will develop detailed code requirements for classifying, modifying (where necessary), scheduling and promoting programs in all classification categories, i.e. G, PG, M and MA. Those code requirements will be developed in consultation with the Australian Broadcasting Authority. The codes will apply the OFLC's classification system to films, and to M and MA programs which are given their initial classification by stations. We would expect to be able to release a draft code for public comment within the next month, and to present it to the Australian Broadcasting Authority for registration in February 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry has already advised the Government that it proposes to incorporate the following measures in its self-regulatory codes:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">mandatory standardised indications of the levels of violence, sex and coarse language in television M and MA films and in other M and MA programs as required. These announcements will be broadcast before films in both audio and visual form, and there will be clear visual indications at the start of each segment of the film's classification and nature.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further restrictions on early evening promotions for films.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry also committed itself to taking the following steps to support these code measures:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">regular on-air announcements explaining the meaning of classification symbols and content descriptions, and encouraging viewers to use them in planning their viewing and their children's viewing. The frequency of these announcements will be stepped up during school holidays, paying particular attention to times when parents are watching in large numbers.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A continuing high visibility press campaign to support these on-air announcements&mdash;again focussing on school holidays</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">stations will include program classification symbols and content descriptions in press advertising of programs</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">stations will urge newspapers and magazines to display and explain program classification symbols and content descriptions in program guides.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the light of points raised in Parliament in recent weeks, we want to emphasise several points about the way in which programs will be classified under the proposed code:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry intends that the new television M and MA categories should together correspond exactly to the AO classification. The industry has no intention&mdash;or wish&mdash;to introduce "tougher" material to television, as some Senators have feared. The codes will require films classified MA or M for cinema to be modified to make them suitable for the television medium. In broad terms, the top end of the television MA category will correspond to the bottom end of the MA cinema classification.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps I could explain to Senator Bourne, and other honourable senators, the point of the subsequent amendment that the Government intends moving to Senator Alston's amendment. I know that Senator Walters has had a strong role to play in bringing this Opposition amendment to the chamber. We absolutely support the principle on which this is based. That is to provide an assurance that there will be no broadcasting whatever of any material that is not in the current AO classification. That is the reason why we have deleted from the original circulated Government amendment its first section&mdash;because we will now support the Opposition's amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government considers the effect of the second amendment, however, to be extremely important. It does not subvert or overtake the Harradine amendment, which is still in force. It properly restores the correct role of the ABA as the routine monitor of the standards in the community. That is precisely the reason why we set up the Australian Broadcasting Authority&mdash;to act as the daily monitor and regulator. It is not a role that the Parliament&mdash;because of the mass of business that it deals with, apart from anything else&mdash;can routinely exercise. For that reason I had hoped that the Opposition would have felt that it could have supported that addition, seeing as that is the only effect of it&mdash;in other words, to simply put into legislation the role the ABA already has&mdash;in the same way as we intend to support the Opposition's amendment in terms of the principle that nothing in the new MA and M classifications will go beyond AO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the Government amendment does is reassert what the ABA does now under the principal Act. That is, the ABA will continue to monitor community standards, will review them regularly and will report directly to the Minister. It does not overtake or supplant&mdash;how can it?&mdash;the Harradine amendment, which is still in force. In addition to that process, which simply encapsulates in legislation the role of the ABA, Parliament at any time can intervene under the Harradine amendment and impose its own will or collective view on this matter if it wishes to do so. So the amendment is not a substitute for the Harradine amendment. It simply reiterates in legislation the primary function of the ABA to oversight these codes of practice and to routinely review them, as it must do if it is doing its job, and to report the results of those reviews directly to the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very much in favour of having one classification across the board for television, film and video. I understood that there would have been a great deal of difficulty in doing that. We have now ended up with an M classification and an MA classification which cover both television and film. I understand very clearly what the Minister is saying. But we now have four different M classifications: we have an M for film and video, we have an MA for film and video, we have an M&mdash;which is totally different because it has been modified considerably&mdash;for television, and we have an MA which is totally different from the other MA because it has been modified for television. That would be very confusing for a mother, who may say to her children, `On Saturday night you can watch a film on television so long as it is all right'. A film then comes up, the name of which that mother has seen on a video under M. She may say, `No, you can't watch that'. She does not know how it has been modified for television. She just knows that when she saw that M video it was not suitable for her children to watch. So we have the dilemma of a mother saying to her children, `No, I have seen that film and you are not going to stay up and watch that sort of film'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in point of fact, because it has been modified so greatly&mdash;all or most of the violence has been taken out&mdash;it could be quite suitable for the children to see. How on earth do parents understand the new system? At least in the previous system they knew that AO did not equate with M and M videos that they had seen. But under the new system, parents might see an MA or an M on the video and say, `No, I'm sorry, you can't watch that, it is too violent. I'm not having that on at this hour in this home'. The parents could be totally wrong; they have no idea how the video has been modified because the same term is used. Therefore, I think the films have to be called M film, M television, MA film and MA television. Otherwise parents will not have any way to be able to judge what is going to come across the screen in the home at night. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In fact, quite the contrary will be the case. I understand the point that Senator Walters is making, but the Government anticipated the need to do this right from the first time that we started debating this proposed change here in Parliament. There is no question that free to air television is considered to have a greater opportunity to access viewers than the cinema where some supervision is exercised. In most cinemas there is such supervision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that I really do commend to the Senate is what I believe to be a greatly enhanced sensible regulatory regime at cinemas, which I know has worried cinema owners. What happens in the real world&mdash;and there is no question that it happens&mdash;is that parents drop their kids off at a multi-cinema complex, which is the norm now, even in small towns like Darwin, where four or five cinemas are served by the one front door. Children go into the cinema to watch <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Never Ending Story</EMPHASIS> and end up watching something a lot more violent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Walters looks at the fundamental change between M and MA, which I am told will be of great assistance to cinemas in providing better supervision, she will find that the difference is that the M classification will be fundamentally for 15 years and over, and the MA classification will be for children accompanied by an adult. I am not talking about television for the moment, but I am just saying that I think that the broad new classification has provided a better classificatory regime for film. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the television industry is doing is no more than it has already done. I said a few moments ago that the actual percentage of R rated films that can be modified without completely losing the story and the continuity is very small. From memory I think only about 2 to 3 per cent of material broadcast is R modified. R rated films are currently broadcast on television under the AO classification, because they have been heavily modified for television, but there is no special classification or advice to the viewer that that modification has been carried out. This causes confusion now to an informed viewer. It does not matter that there is an R classification on the film because people know that the movie they are watching on TV has been broadcast at their local cinema in an R rated category. People are very broadly aware of those classifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, research has shown that people place a high value on classifications. The new proposals will in fact give better protection and better advice for parents in this sense. Currently, the only way for a concerned parent to access the detailed codes&mdash;and Senator Walters is one of these people who wants this in detail, and many people do&mdash;is to access the material which is made available by the Office of Film and Literature Classification. Senator Walters would know that it tries to promote this material as much as it possibly can. A recent series of national seminars has been run at cinemas. I attended the one that was held in Darwin to launch the office's published material so that parents who really want to know the detail of how these classifications are made&mdash;none of which could actually be put on the screen because it would take too long&mdash;can access this material from the Office of Film and Literature Classification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The modification classifications that will be made for television will be made available in exactly the same way but with one additional benefit. The television operators have already made it clear&mdash;this is contained in the letter that has now been incorporated&mdash;that detailed code requirements for classifying and modifying where necessary will be published. So as well as the classification divisions, which, as Senator Walters knows, are quite complex in terms of their determinants, these requirements will be published in precisely the same way as the Office of Film and Literature Classification publishes the current material. But instead of it being done without any publicity, as it currently is in terms of R films being modified for television, that advice to the viewer will be put on the screen. What it does provide is at least broad similarity between the classification structures in cinemas and the classifications structure on television, which is currently absent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We conceded from the first jump in this debate that one could not get a total classificatory regime, and I do not think it is desirable to have it. The television operators believe that further modification is required to most of these films if they are to be broadcast at all on television. So a national television campaign will be run by the broadcasters explaining in detail the new classifications, how they are going to work, and the modification differences with television. They will give advice to viewers as to where people who are interested can access the detailed material. This will be done in the same way as the Office of Film and Literature Classification does that now. Of course, when being broadcast the material will actually have the tag attached to it. So there will not be any confusion that the material has been modified for television. If viewers are watching a program for which an M classification has not been qualified, they will know that that is the same M classification that applies to the material being shown at the cinema. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tag `modified for television' may be put on a program. Anyone concerned enough&mdash;and I will be one of them&mdash;to want to know what that means will have easy access to the detailed classificatory standards that will be applied to effect that modification. In essence, this will not be more confusing. It will provide a far more specific and far more information rich, if you like, regime for parents who are seriously interested in what their children are going to watch. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To follow up on what Senator Walters has said, I go to the amendment that is before us. That amendment indicates that section 123 of the principal Act will require the industry to develop codes of practice, including codes to provide for the methods of modifying films having particular classification under that system so that the films are suitable to be broadcast or broadcast at particular times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two issues to which I want to refer. Firstly, in respect of modification, are we really being asked to buy a pig in a poke here? I want to say something about the OFLC. I think the OFLC has not done its job in certain areas. I fear that what is happening here is that, if the OFLC has a final say on this matter, we will end up with worse material on television than we have now&mdash;and that is despite the statement made by the OFLC to our Committee. I am not impugning the OFLC's integrity in any way, shape or form. I think it is horses for courses and that the OFLC is the body to be dealing with classifications for film and video, but I do not think it has had the expertise or experience or longstanding knowledge of this area that the staff of the ABA and the previous ABT have had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am getting at is that, when we talk about methods of modifying films, I have had a look at the current methods of modifying films that are undertaken by three of the major networks. Frankly, in some areas they are as different as chalk is from cheese. With material that is classified and is able to be shown as an AO film or an AO program&mdash;bearing in mind that they have AO programs as well as AO films&mdash;one network will not show those films and another network will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has given to the chamber two undertakings: the first is that there will be no worse material shown than that which is currently shown as AO material; and, secondly, that there will be no worse material than that which is classified as AO material. That is the point&mdash;classified by the classification officers in the various networks. Our problem is&mdash;and it is a problem not only for us but also for the industry&mdash;that the various networks classify these in different ways. I understand what the Minister said before, that it has to be the majority view of the industry as to what the methods of modifying films will be, but at the present time we are being asked to buy a pig in a poke in respect of that issue because we do not know what the methods of modifying films will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not suggest we hold this up because I think it is an improvement along the way, but I believe that the Parliament in the final analysis has to have a look at that. The Minister says, `If you are not satisfied with that, then you can go for the Harradine amendment'. I do hope that, if anybody goes for that, that motion is not put at the bottom of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. I do not want to go over those arguments, but the Minister did make some interesting observations and I have had a look at them since. When I put the two effective parts of that motion&mdash;namely, the 15 days&mdash;the Minister said that they were `horrific' proposals&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Committee that unless the industry gets it right, action will be taken in the Parliament. I hope that the Government will not stand in the way of serious action&mdash;I am not talking about flippant action&mdash;that might be taken. I am not reflecting on the industry because, to be fair to the industry, the day that the ABT committee, comprising those three persons whom I mentioned, came down with its recommendations, Mr Branigan, who is FACTS director, came out with a statement saying that the industry did not want to go to that extent. I commend the industry for that decision. I really want to know when these methods of modifying films will be able to be exposed, if I can use that word, for public viewing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter involves the film classifications M and MA. We are not told in this legislation what M and MA really mean. I suppose we are really being told that only the very mildest films will be included in the new M category. The document that was tabled by Senator Tate in the Parliament some time during the week following the meeting of the Premiers included a draft document by the OFLC about what it thought. It said that the M classification will be recommended for mature audiences 15 years and over and that MA will be restricted to mature audiences 15 years and over, unless accompanied by a parent or guardian. I will not go into what the film classifications will be because I presume that the States will apply certain restrictions to the entrance of persons into the cinemas to see MA classified material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Film Censorship Board has put forward some proposals on language in MA classified material. As I read what the Board is proposing, the language allowed will be worse in the M category than is currently available under AO. The Film Censorship Board of the OFLC says that crude language for the M category may be used, but not if overly frequent or impactful. But the current AO classification says that the occasional use of offensive language must be appropriate to the story-line or program context. The M classification says nothing about that. So on the face of it that proposal will allow worse language to be used in M than is currently able to be used in the AO category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to the Minister to look at what the OFLC is proposing and to request the ABA or some group that has more expertise in the area of broadcasting to look at these things. Similarly, in respect of sexual material for television, the term `sexual intercourse' is being used for the first time in this document which has been provided by the OFLC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current provision relating to AO says that intimate sexual behaviour may only be discreetly implied or simulated and must be relevant to the story-line or program context, et cetera. I have looked at the guidelines used by some of the television stations and it is clear to me that they would exclude simulated sexual intercourse that is now suggested by the OFLC to be acceptable under the MA classification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, there is a problem with violence. The OFLC appeared before the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Telecommunications Technologies on 1 June 1992. The OFLC was questioned about what it had been doing to tighten up the M classification. It asserted that it had been tightening up on the M classification so far as violence was concerned. It was not obvious how that was being done. The OFLC said that it had applied stricter guidelines for violence. We all thought that the States had recommended that the OFLC tighten up on violence and that that would mean it would bring out a tighter definition in its classification.

It is not a pig in a poke, as Senator Harradine would know better than anyone, courtesy of the Harradine amendment, because after that full community consultation occurs and after the codes of practice are prepared which will lay out all the details Senator Harradine seeks the ABA will be the agency that enforces it, not the Office of Film and Literature Classification. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak first to the Housing Assistance Amendment Bill 1992. In doing so, I point out that the coalition has always been very strongly committed to the principle of home ownership. That is why we have exempted the final sale price of a house from the proposed goods and services tax in the Fightback document. We have included measures in Fightback to put home ownership within the reach of a greater number of Australians. The Fightback proposals to establish two million jobs over the decade will help those Australians who aspire to own their own home but who are suffering the scourge of unemployment and therefore are unable to achieve their dream of home ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be reintroducing the first home owners scheme. We will be providing access for first home buyers to up to 75 per cent of their accumulated superannuation contributions for use as a deposit or part deposit on a home. That was a recommendation of the Lavarch committee which has not been addressed by the Government. We will be introducing a tax-free savings scheme which will, in a very important way, help people who are trying to achieve home ownership. Our substantial income tax cuts and the increases to family allowances and other government payments will mean that individuals and families will have higher after-tax income with which to service their mortgages. Last but not least, our commitment to a low inflation rate policy will help to ensure that housing prices remain stable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say all that because it is very important in a debate on housing to understand the position from which members of the Senate are debating the issues. We, as an opposition, have a very strong commitment to home ownership, which we have always had, which we will maintain and which the Fightback document enshrines. The Bill before us today amends the Housing Assistance Act 1989 and extends the period of the guaranteed funding under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement for a further three years. The Bill also improves the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement financial management procedures by making the States more accountable for their housing plans and for their funding priorities, by encouraging them to more finely target their activities and by making them more responsive to the needs of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the States have largely had a free rein in spending public housing funds, we believe that these reforms are long overdue. They are certainly supported by the coalition. There is an appropriation of $4.7 billion to the States over four years. The Bill also implements the Government's Budget announcement to bring forward some Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement expenditure to generate employment&mdash;not before time. $75m has been brought forward for expenditure in this financial year and $25m in 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Understandably, the housing industry is in favour of this measure, as it will guarantee some work to an industry which has suffered badly under the recession. This measure is, however, a damning indictment of the Government and the economic policies which have left nearly one million Australians unemployed. The proposal will not have any impact on the total three-year allocation, as the amounts brought forward have been offset by reductions in subsequent years. The Housing Assistance Amendment Bill enables any Commonwealth grants allocated to a State in a particular grant year but not paid in that year to be held over until the following year. This measure will encourage more discretionary spending patterns, ensuring that the States better meet the housing needs and get value for money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making these changes to the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, the Minister should have taken the opportunity to undertake more far reaching changes which would meet the growing demand for public housing. I draw to your attention the fact that public housing waiting lists grew by a massive 20,750, that is, 10.2 per cent, over the last financial year. I notice that in New South Wales, for example, the housing list at 30 June last year was 64,895 and that this year it grew to 71,458. In Victoria last year it was 38,935 and it has increased to 50,482. Here in the ACT there has been an incredible growth from 3,832 to 6,852. These figures very much reflect what is happening to Australians in their need for public housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lucky country which, at the beginning of the decade, was the third richest in the world, now has a massive and growing public housing waiting list. It is extraordinary that this should be the harvest we are all reaping as a result of the policies of a Government which has been in power for 10 years. Those figures are tangible proof of the devastation caused by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his colleagues and their economic policies. Do not let us forget the record high interest rates, the economic recession and those nearly one million Australians who are unemployed, all of which has pushed many a family into housing poverty. The public housing system is not working and the Keating Government has failed to recognise that there must be other ways of providing affordable accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be understood that, in our support for home ownership in Australia, the coalition also recognises the need for public housing, and we will retain the fundamentals of the current public housing system.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to what the big bogy of the coalition is likely to do in government, let it be clearly on the record that we believe that we can produce more public housing and reduce waiting lists by a more imaginative use of public funding. I am surprised that the Government itself has not been prepared to adopt the sorts of measures that we are talking about because, in the Defence Housing Authority area, for instance, it has been doing exactly what we propose to do with the States under the Commonwealth-State housing arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will shift the responsibility for the purchase, construction and ownership of new dwellings in which public tenants are housed from the public to the private sector, with the States effectively leasing these dwellings on a long term basis. That will provide more housing&mdash;not less&mdash;for those in housing crisis, but without the associated high capital costs. The States will also be given the flexibility to develop other innovative funding proposals in conjunction with the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not propose to speak any more on that Bill, because in the limited time that we have available I wish to turn to the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1992. Speaking briefly to the question of hostels, the amendments to the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act allow for the introduction of sanctions against hostels which fail to comply with standards of care and quality of life for residents. They also provide for the establishment of hostel standards review panels. The amendments bring hostels into line with procedures for nursing homes whereby the Commonwealth can take action if nursing home proprietors are not providing residents with the quality of life required by gazetted standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments provide the Commonwealth with the ability to suspend payments in respect of new residents to an organisation operating a hostel not complying with the standards. They also provide a peer review mechanism, the hostel standards review panels, for hostel operators who seek review of the assessment of the hostel's compliance with standards. If the panels recommend to the Minister that a declaration of failure to comply is appropriate, they may also recommend that the Commonwealth suspend the payment of financial assistance to the hostel for new residents. A similar sanction has been available in parallel circumstances for nursing home proprietors since 1991, and during that time the Department has taken this course of action against 12 nursing homes. These amendments were expected by the industry; they present no real problems and so I do not propose to discuss that issue any further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning now to nursing homes; funding is provided for upgrading. The Bill seeks to amend the National Health Act in order to implement a 1992-93 Budget initiative providing funding to upgrade nursing homes. Many nursing home proprietors, while aiming to provide good quality care, have difficulty in meeting the Government's outcome standards or health and fire safety standards because they are operating in old or unsuitable buildings. The initiative in this Bill will enable nursing home proprietors to apply for funds to undertake substantial upgrading work which has been identified as necessary for the well-being of their residents and which they might not otherwise be able to afford. The benefit is to be paid as a monthly recurrent benefit over a period of 10 years. It will be calculated in accordance with a formula based on a maximum cost per bed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are generally welcome, but the funding is limited and not all those seeking upgrading funding will get it. I ask the Minister to consider these questions which are being asked by the industry: will applications be considered on a first come, first served basis? Will conditions such as the signing of residents' rights agreements be attached? Sceptics are saying that the funding will go to nursing homes in marginal electorates. I would like to see whether the Government can give us any indication at this time about where that funding is going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we acknowledge that the provision for nursing home advisers to be appointed to nursing homes which have breached the conditions of approved nursing homes is one which is of concern to some parts of the industry. The role of the adviser will be to assist the proprietor of the home to comply with the conditions of approval. It will usually be someone with experience in the management of aged care facilities. If the proprietor was unwilling to accept and pay for an adviser, the normal sanctions process would continue, including closing the home if that became necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports measures which are designed to enforce high standards of care for elderly Australians. We do, however, share some concerns as to how the nursing homes advisers proposal will actually be implemented. I understand that one of the peak bodies has been successfully involved with a number of homes which failed to meet the standards and, in those situations, trained staff and members of the association have worked with the nursing home and the Commonwealth-States monitoring team to sort through issues regarding practical requirements and nursing care issues. That method of rapidly helping the nursing home to achieve the standards has not only been most satisfactory but also occurs no additional cost to the nursing home and consequently does not affect the standard of care that the home is able to maintain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the end of the debate in this place I would like the Minister to put on the record where these advisers will be drawn from and who they will be. Will they come from private industry; will they come from the Department; what will their qualifications be; which funding component will the money to pay them come from; and, could not the standards monitoring teams do the job at less cost? I suppose it is indicative of the lack of information which is available to the industry that these questions need to be asked in the debate. Perhaps it is a failure of adequate consultation that they need to be asked at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some concern in the industry that these changes will give the Minister and the Department more power over a nursing home which it considers is breaching standards. As I have said, I hold no brief for an institution which is breaching standards. The appointed advisers will have no legal responsibility or liability under the Act, apparently. There are no safeguards on cost imposts on the proprietor or the nature and qualifications of the adviser. The current procedure, if a nursing home is considered not to have met outcome standards, is for the Minister to impose financial sanctions on the home and it is no longer funded for new admittances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will result in the proprietor, who already has reduced funds&mdash;that is, no funding for new admittances&mdash;having to maintain staffing levels and services in addition to paying an indeterminate amount to an adviser. The amendments are silent on whether the payment for services of an adviser is claimable under CAM or SAM, or how it will be treated in terms of NH20, reconciliation and validation. Clearly, there is more information needed on all these areas. Let us not forget that one major reason why nursing homes fail to meet standards is related to cash flow, and that seems to be something which is not well understood in the Department, as I said in this place only recently. The best people to sort out these problems are those with a background in the nursing home business and with a knowledge of standards. There are major doubts as to whether the Department could find the practical employees who are needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I conclude, I draw attention to something which is symptomatic of the problem being faced by the industry. I have been very concerned and outspoken about the heavy hand of regulation, bureaucracy and bureaucratic control on this industry. Standards need to be maintained and the taxpayer also needs to be protected in terms of the revenue, but I think things are getting out of hand when one gets a nine-page document like the one that I have here with me&mdash;nine pages all to address a very specific aspect of funding. This is just one part of the funding process. This document is entitled `Nursing Home Additional Recurrent Funding for Enteral Feeding Additional Information'. The nine pages are going to all non-government nursing homes for the aged, excluding adjusted fee government nursing homes, all State and Territory offices from the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. One wonders how many trees got chopped down to do it. I would love to be able to read it all to honourable senators because it is in great bureaucratese. Maybe we could have plain English classes in the Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an indication of why senior nursing staff are tearing their hair out as a result of the Government's bureaucratic demands, and we heard evidence of this in the committees recently. There are myriad forms to fill in. This matter of enteral feeding goes on for nine pages of instructions and requires an NH22 schedule to be filled in; then it requires an NH3A form entitled `Nursing and Personal Care Details' to be filled in; the schedule must be attached to the monthly NH3 claim for Commonwealth benefits forms; then at the end of the financial year the nursing home will need to complete a NH24 `Finalisation of Enteral Feeding Expenditure for Non-government Nursing Homes for the Aged' giving details of the amounts actually spent. There are myriads of these forms that have to be filled out constantly by directors of nursing in these organisations all around the country. They are saying they do not have the time to give the nursing care and the personal attention that the residents need. The reason they do not have the time is the unrealistic demands that are being imposed on them from Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something has to call a stop to the process. I just do not know that people here are aware of what they are doing to nursing homes and, increasingly, to hostels. Anybody who has had any contact with the aged care industry would acknowledge the growing and excessive regulation and bureaucratic control of the funding program. It is leading also to uncertainty in the funding system and to an unacceptable reduction in the amount of time available for the nursing and personal care staff to care for frail aged Australians. It is time that the funding became more certain and for the onerous demands of government on the nursing staff in the nursing homes and hostels to be reduced. I make a plea for the Department and the Government to undertake a New Year resolution to reduce the bureaucratic burdens that they are placing on this industry so that older Australians can get all the care they so badly need. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The main purpose of the Housing Assistance Amendment Bill is the allocation of additional government funds to the community housing area pursuant to measures contained in the Government's 1992-93 Budget. The legislative package provides for more than $4 billion to be spent over the next four years on public housing measures under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement and it seeks to increase the quantity of public housing available in that period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the amendments will allow States and Territories more flexibility in the planning stages of public housing programs, and this is something that obviously has been needed for some time in the public housing funding area. Nevertheless, I would like to express a concern that has been brought to us by the community that is concerned with the provision of public housing and by people who rely on public housing, and that is that this should not become a trend towards totally untied grants by the Government to the States. I would like the Minister to give us an assurance that this loosening of the provisions will not mean that moneys provided to the States for public housing purposes could, under certain conditions, be spent in other ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concern has also been expressed about the internal flexibility, which is, on principle, welcome. However, there must be some concern when you look at the fact that some State governments might be pursuing a different philosophical agenda in line with the Fightback package and some assurance would be needed, for instance, that the funds could not be used to provide, say, vouchers for rental assistance. Those methods have been shown internationally to be ineffective in helping the people concerned who are looking for housing assistance but rather have increased the cost of housing in a market economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To that extent, I take with a grain of salt the assurance that Senator Newman has given on the public housing aspects of the Fightback package because it is quite clear that the philosophy that is being pursued is to shift public housing into private enterprise hands and to give rental subsidies to people looking for public housing. I refer again to research which is on the table which shows that this is not a very effective way of providing public housing assistance. It is also quite clear that shifting the ownership and control of the public housing stock away from governments and into private enterprise will considerably reduce control of the direction of priorities as to the location and other decisions that have to be made on the basis of social considerations. I believe that it is not a trend that is to be welcomed and I can fully understand the concerns expressed by sections of the community about this trend and about the proposals in Fightback&mdash;to a large extent the Australian Democrats share them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the Bill, the $4 billion allocation over four years includes additional funding of $123m to be directly allocated to community housing. Despite the amount of funding contained in this legislative package, however, it is necessary to assess the measures against the general background of consistent government cutbacks in the housing area over a long period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1983, when the Australian Labor Party came to office, housing has been treated, at best, as a low priority by this Government, particularly under the strict economic rationalism practised by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he was Treasurer. In the past, the Federal Government has attempted to throw much of the blame for our present housing crisis on State and local governments. This has been a rather devious strategy, I submit, since it is only the Federal Government which has had the full economic and taxation powers to deal with Australia's mounting housing crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own State of Victoria, we now face a major housing crisis, with homelessness having reached unprecedented levels and the number of people on public housing waiting lists having increased from 38,000 to over 55,000 in the past two years, according to a report recently released by the Victorian Council of Social Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government claims that the Bill before us increases public housing funding in a very real way. To some extent that is true but, as I have said before, it must be seen against the reduction of expenditure in this area during the last four years. In the period between 1986 and 1990, funding under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement was effectively reduced by up to 40 per cent in some cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if one were able to take into account the increases before us in this Bill, government funding to housing programs would still be well below the levels of allocation in the Budgets handed down in 1983-84 and 1984-85. The cuts have had a severe effect on the public housing programs currently in place. I suspect that the Government's fairly recent conversion to bolstering public housing with funding injections, as set out in the legislation before us, is founded on the wish to get the economy going rather than to supply more public housing to the people who need it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats recently released a policy statement entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Getting to Work</EMPHASIS>.

With respect to public housing, the Defence Housing Authority has agreements with organisations in the private sector which build housing. The Defence Housing Authority rents those houses at full commercial rates, and then it sublets them to Defence families. Defence pays the Housing Authority the subsidy, which is the difference between the commercial rent and what the tenant pays.

I will not go over those because we are running out of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final amendment proposed by this legislation will rectify an anomaly which disadvantages pathology practices that choose to merge. Currently, when two or more practices merge, the resulting approved pathology authority loses the right to temporary licence collection centres.

The Government has also claimed that this amendment will do much to discourage unnecessary over-servicing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the amendments contained in this Bill. However, it must be pointed out that we do have some concerns, as Senator Newman has said, about the allocation of sufficient funding to nursing homes seeking upgrading. As she has already said, we are highly critical of the many inadequacies in the Government's aged care health policies which are highlighted in this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerning the pathology amendments, it must be noted that the Bill does not do anything to address the massive blow-out in expenditure under Medicare.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the financial year 1991-92 the total expenditure on benefits under Medicare increased by 8.2 per cent to a staggering $4.6 billion. This is compared with a total expenditure on Medicare benefits of $2.2 billion in the first financial year of Medicare in 1984-85. This means that, since the inception of Medicare in 1984, benefits paid under Medicare for services ranging from general practice to optometry have risen by 101.1 per cent. Despite this increase we still have a health care system which is incapable of delivering an efficient, effective and timely health service to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pathology amendments also do nothing to meet the criticisms levelled at the Government by the Australian Association of Pathology Practices. The peak industry body has stated that it has been subjected to continual changes in its legislation resulting in anomalies and ambiguities that the Government has been very reluctant to address. We hear this over and over again. It has happened with a number of the health professions, including the pharmacy profession, and we see it now happening with pathologists. The pathologists' amendment we are discussing provides a good example of the Government's reluctance to listen to the industry. </PARA>

The Government has been tardy in addressing this and correcting it, and then we waste time in the Senate going back over it. We ought to be getting it right in the first place. There is an army of people who should be able to go through it and think about all the consequences and maybe try to generate some of the unintended consequences to ensure that people are not affected, and especially that their livelihoods are not affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having changed the legislation in haste, it was then discovered that pathology practices would be discouraged from merging because they would lose their temporary licences. This was pointed out to the Government but it has taken some time to convince it to make this necessary amendment. In the meantime the Government's inaction has meant that pathology practice mergers have been on the brink, on the edge, waiting, as some of the pathologists said to me this morning. It has been at some expense to their operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the coalition supports the amendments in this Bill, we are disappointed that the Government has once again failed to provide any long term assistance for our failing health and aged care sectors. It again has demonstrated its lack of consultation with the health professions, and also its inability to get its act together to amend legislation when it is wrong to make sure that these people who have been affected by it do not have to wait the length of time they have waited in this instance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be speaking on the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill, which contains several measures relating to hostels and nursing homes. Some of these were announced in the Budget and others have been on the drawing board for quite some time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill sets up a mechanism for establishing hostel standards review panels in each State, the ACT and the Northern Territory. These panels will provide additional peer review in the process of hostel monitoring. At present, departmental monitoring teams measure a hostel's performance against a formal set of standards and this has been in effect since 1 January last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this Bill, the Minister may make a declaration stating that a particular hostel operator is not complying with the standards. Once the declaration has been made, the Minister has the power to suspend payment to the operator, although that suspension applies only to hostel places that are unoccupied or become unoccupied after the declaration is made. At this point, the hostel operator can apply to the hostel standards review panel for a review. The panels will have the power to review the operation of the hostels, either at the direction of the Minister or as a result of a written request from the hostel operator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After conducting a review, the panel will then recommend to the Minister whether a declaration should be made or not, whether Commonwealth payments should be suspended&mdash;and, if so, for how long&mdash;and whether the panel's report should be released to the operator, the staff and the hostel's residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have some concerns about the last provision. We are talking about a panel which has the power to recommend to a Minister that Commonwealth payments be suspended. Furthermore, if the Minister goes ahead and makes a declaration based on the panel's review, information about the hostel can be made public. The information includes the name and address of the hostel; the name and address of any other hostel that the operator owns and runs; the operator's business name and address; details of the operator's failure to meet the standards; and what actions the Minister has taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we can see that it is a very important panel and it could well result in the closure of a hostel. Certainly that is fair enough if it is providing inadequate care, but I would have thought that simple natural justice would have meant that the operators have an automatic right to actually see a report from the panel. It also should be quite reasonable to expect that the staff automatically would get a look at the report and, perhaps even more importantly, that the residents and their relatives should have a right to see it. I would appreciate some clarification from the Minister as to why this provision appears in the Bill as it does because, on the face of it, it appears to be rather unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides for Commonwealth grants to be paid to proprietors of nursing homes to enable them to substantially upgrade their premises. This extends to the private for profit sector, an arrangement which has been available to the voluntary sector for several years. From now on, a proprietor can apply to the Minister for specific assistance from the Commonwealth, where she or he believes that upgrading of the premises will increase the well-being of the home's residents. I know from visiting some of the homes that there are some proprietors who are very keen to see the physical upgrading go ahead to improve the standard of their premises, so this proposal, which was announced in the Budget, will be good news for all those proprietors and their residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides for a nursing home adviser to be appointed to a nursing home where the home has breached its conditions of approval. The adviser's role will be to assist the proprietor to move to a situation where the home does comply with the conditions of approval. The proprietor will continue to be responsible for the home. In effect, the Government is saying to these homes, `Instead of us shutting you down, here is an opportunity to cooperate with us to try to fix the problem'. I am aware that there are some in the industry who are concerned about this provision. I do not believe that it is a particularly draconian arrangement, although I do see some problems with how it is actually going to work in practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am well aware of the excellent work done in the vast majority of nursing homes by dedicated staff and also by proprietors who are committed to providing the best possible care for their residents. However, we have to keep in the back of our minds that there are some homes where we really do have some major problems and which certainly need to be brought up to standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to acknowledge there is a level of accountability here. Firstly, nursing home proprietors are accountable for Commonwealth funds and, therefore, the Commonwealth has every right to actually impose some quite strict conditions and standards on them. Secondly, there is surely a level of accountability to a group of people who are amongst the most vulnerable in our society: the residents. They are often powerless themselves to assert their rights, and I think the Commonwealth, whether or not it is handing out the funds, certainly has an obligation to look after this group of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I have two particular concerns about these provisions which I raise now, and I look forward to the Minister's response. Firstly, one of my concerns is that the appointment of an adviser may slow down a process which should, in fact, be speeded up. I would not like to see advisers appointed in situations where a nursing home is so bad that it ought to be closed down, or to have sanctions immediately applied to it. I would not like to see the appointment of advisers result in the duplication of work which should be carried out by the standards monitoring teams. Secondly, I know the industry is concerned about the fact that this provision is open-ended. In other words, there is no time limit and no financial figure put on the appointment of an adviser, and indeed, no details as to how that adviser is to be paid for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presumably, the process cannot drag on and on forever. It is not fair to residents if the adviser fails to meet with success and the nursing home goes on continuing to operate and providing that inadequate standard of care. Surely, there needs to be either a time limit or some trigger which will move the process into a new phase, possibly at the application of further sanctions and possibly closure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the opposite point of view, it is not fair on proprietors if they have done everything they possibly could to fix the breaches of conditions but are still financially saddled with an adviser. Again, I thought it would have made some sense to have a provision terminating the appointment of the adviser where the original breach of conditions has been rectified. It may well be the Government's intention that that is how these provisions will work in practice, but it certainly is not clear in the legislation; and I ask for some clarification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, on the other issue in this legislation in relation to pathology and the merger of practices, these patch-up amendments are welcomed by the Democrats and certainly by the industry, but I foreshadow that early in the new year, when we resume in this place, we will need again to look at the whole issue of the delivery of pathology services, particularly regional and remote services. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;The Senate is discussing the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1992. Much of the discussion has centred on perhaps some elements rather than others. In particular, the first discussion concerned the proposal to provide for hostel standards review panels and for sanctions for failure to meet standards. I believe that, in so far as those measures work well in nursing homes, we have reason to be confident that they will also work well in relation to hostels. Certainly, it is important that the Government does protect residents by imposing sanctions on hostels which are providing poor standards of care and quality of life and then, of course, enable operators to have an avenue of appeal through the hostel standards review panels. I do not think there was a great deal of argument about that measure which I picked up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the nursing home upgrading, obviously it is very important to have a provision coming out of the Budget which will allow for the payment of a benefit in respect of upgrading nursing homes where they are run by proprietors who at the moment are not eligible for funding for such capital upgrading. I believe that these private homes will, of course, welcome this particular measure. It is a substantial one indeed. The element of that particular discussion which attracted attention I do not think needs very much comment by me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The further element in relation to nursing homes, though, was the provision which allows a nursing home adviser to be appointed to a nursing home that has breached the conditions of approval of approved nursing homes. This particular adviser will, of course, be appointed&mdash;that is true&mdash;from a list approved by the Secretary to the Department, but it is intended that there be very full discussion with the industry before drawing up a list of persons who could act as advisers. They would certainly be people experienced in management of age care facilities. They would not be departmental officers and they will be put on a list only after consultation with the industry as to suitable persons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appointment of such a person will, of course, be in a sense offered as an alternative to closure or a very heavy sanction being imposed in relation to the management of the nursing home concerned. It is, therefore, quite clearly going to be in the interests of the nursing home proprietor to take up that particular possibility as an alternative to a more draconian sanction. It is expected that the nursing home will pay for the person who is put in for that purpose. I think Senator Newman asked about whether there could be reimbursement under the CAM system or SAM funding or whatever. The fact is that it will be a cost that will be borne by the nursing home, and I think the cost is to be agreed between the two by way of contract. Something will emerge, I suppose, as the norm, though one would hope that this will be a fairly rare event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees asked some questions about whether a person ought to be appointed at all where it might be better to grasp the nettle and close down the nursing home if in fact it is being run in a way which is really putting the well-being of the residents in true jeopardy. I think that would be a matter that would be taken into account in the process. Senator Lees also asked about a time limit, particularly where the problem has been rectified. I would imagine&mdash;just off the top of my head&mdash;that it would be possible to write into the arrangement between the nursing home and the adviser that the arrangement would cease when the reason for which the person having been brought in had itself ceased to exist. These are matters which are of true concern and I will seek assurances from the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, Mr Howe, that he will endeavour to meet those concerns that have been raised by Senator Lees, and those concerns should be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the pathology matters, I do not think there is anything much that requires discussion there. It is, as has been mentioned, a patch-up provision. Where two and more pathology practices merge, the resulting improved pathology authority that emerges loses the right to temporary licensed collection centres, and that has to be remedied. I understand that the Australian Association of Pathology Practitioners, which is the industry association, has stated that it supports the amendments, as you would expect. Just in relation to one point that Senator Patterson made&mdash;I am always interested in her contributions&mdash;I understand that pathology has had a negative growth in outlays. I do not know quite what that means, how you have a negative growth, but I presume that it means no growth at all or that in fact it has gone down slightly. It must be relevant to something that Senator Patterson has said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the Housing Assistance Amendment Bill 1992, this is a very important earnest of the Government's commitment to public and community housing, with a Budget provision of $4 billion over four years to 1995-96. Another $4 billion will be provided in the same period for rent assistance, together with $816m for the building better cities program and $25.5m for the national urban development program. I believe that, contrary to some of Senator Spindler's concerns or fears about the implementation of these particular programs, the major theme of the strategy is to recognise the need for housing variety and choice, given the very many different types of households and differing needs at different points in the lives of individuals. I think it is also important to say to Senator Spindler that the Commonwealth will have control of the principles which underlie the provision of this type of accommodation under these arrangements by the States. The States will not be able to impose their ideological or political agenda on the provision of such housing or accommodation if it departs from that which commends itself to the Federal government as it may be from time to time. I think that that is an important matter to reaffirm. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important to raise in the Committee as a whole some of the matters that were discussed in the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training in relation to the Australian National Training Authority Bill. I am not convinced that this Bill properly addresses all the concerns involved in the operation of the new Australian National Training Authority. In the Committee hearings we had representatives from industry express concerns about the operation of ANTA. These primarily involved: firstly, the problem of bureaucracy and centralism; secondly, the danger posed by State training profiles; and, thirdly, the seeming lack of industry consultation in the setting up of ANTA. It is absolutely critical that ANTA avoids excessive bureaucracy and allows existing State agencies to respond flexibly to local need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was very clear from all the witnesses called before the public hearings that planning nationally and doing locally was the critical balance that had to be achieved in this area. I am not completely convinced that the structure of ANTA will be able to achieve this. I am aware that it is not ANTA's role to be directly involved in curriculum, nor will it in any way impose curriculum or training on the various agencies and States. However, there is a need for State training profiles and this seems to me to be potentially intrusive and could easily place unnecessary burdens on training agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When these concerns were raised in the Committee hearings, officers from the Department assured us that these profiles applied at the whole of the State level and not at the level of individual institutions. Therefore, we were told that our fears were totally unfounded. But I dispute this. As these proposals stand, ANTA will require State training profiles to be developed. These profiles will provide a broad indication of the training operations at the State level which should be consistent with the national training direction set by the Ministerial Council. The Ministerial Council will then formally approve the State profiles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way for the States to develop profiles is to require individual institutions to provide information on their curricula. Thus, although the bureaucracy in paperwork is not imposed directly from ANTA, it is required by ANTA indirectly. From this, it is only a small step for ANTA and associated bureaucrats to start imposing on the individual training institutions requirements which would create a centrally structured bureaucratic and inflexible system. This is what happened with the Dawkins national unified system disaster at the university level. We certainly do not want to see this repeated in any other area of education. If it happens to the training sector, it could overstep that very important balance that I alluded to earlier&mdash;the balance between planning nationally and doing locally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important issue to arise out of the Committee's hearings was the extreme importance of industry involvement. Industry must be involved in all the stages of establishing and operating ANTA. It is disconcerting, therefore, that there has been virtually no consultation with industry bodies in the development of the legislation that is before us today. This is just another area where the operation of ANTA needs very close observation. It will be important for the ANTA board members to ensure that industry is closely consulted. To this end, it is very good to see that Mr Brian Finn has been appointed as the chairman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I support the establishment of the Australian National Training Authority, I believe that the concerns I have raised are very valid. To this end, it is very important that ANTA and its operations be reviewed by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, and the Committee has proposed that this be done one year from now. In this way, we can ensure that ANTA is operating to the satisfaction of industry, government, training organisations and the students it serves. If it is not, we will be able to correct the situation before ANTA becomes just another arm of centralist government in the education sector. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment seeks to prohibit the re-exportation of food that has failed on public health grounds, as specified in clause 3(2) of the Imported Food Control Bill, because it contains pathogenic micro-organisms or their toxins, and high levels of chemicals or additives or non-approved chemicals and additives. Basically this is food not fit for human consumption. So I do not see why Australia should say, `This food is not good enough for us to eat, but we do not mind you shipping it out to some other country for people there to eat, because they have lower standards or poorer inspection processes'. I feel quite strongly that Australia should not be part of that practice that leads to port hopping for substandard food. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under my amendment, the exporter will still have the opportunity to rework the food into something else. For example, the food can be reworked into animal feed or fertiliser, or the importer can have the food destroyed and the importer should be carrying insurance for that. As it stands, there is absolutely no incentive for importers to lift their game. They know that if Australia rejects the food on public health and safety grounds, they can just ship it elsewhere.

I understand the idealistic sentiment behind it, and I commend that sentiment, but the view the Government takes is that if an importer brings in food that does not meet our standard that does not mean that the Government should seize that food or direct how it should be dealt with, except for one important qualification I will come to.

The one exception we see to that rule is that if the food clearly cannot be utilised in any other fashion and is, for example, toxic then its re-export should be prohibited. The way we have proposed the Bill it would be. If the food does not meet our standards but meets some other standards, the owner of the food should be able to have the choice of how to deal with it and we should not impose the standards that we want for Australians on the rest of the world simply by saying, `You cannot do that and you cannot have that option despite your investment in the product'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to the decision by the Government's Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics to slash its 1992-93 estimate of growth for the Australian economy by almost one-third down to 2 1/2 per cent. I also refer to the State Bank of New South Wales-New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures December quarter survey of manufacturing which forecast that another 73,000 jobs could be lost in 1993 because small manufacturing companies simply do not believe the Government's predictions of economic recovery. Does the Minister agree with ABARE's downward revision of growth or does he continue to share the Prime Minister's totally cloud-cuckoo-land assertion that economic growth of 4 per cent is achievable this year? When will he recognise that his Government's policies have failed and that the recession was not over long ago, as the Prime Minister asserts. I ask again: when will the Government release its policies?</PARA></TALK.START>

As far as the State Bank of New South Wales-Chamber of Manufactures survey is concerned, I think we have always had a little difficulty with the methodology of that survey&mdash;I nearly said `mythology'&mdash;because they multiply a situation in their own State across national boundaries and try to achieve a result in that way. I much prefer the surveys which have been done&mdash;and there is a bit of selective survey in this business&mdash;by a variety of other organisations, including, of course, the Opposition's own very busy think-tank, Access Economics, which recently made the point that growth was taking place in the smaller business area, not amongst larger businesses where a considerable degree of disemployment was still taking place.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1G4">Senator DEVEREUX</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce seen a report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The challenge of leadership: Australia's emerging high value-added manufacturing exporters</EMPHASIS> published yesterday by the Australian Manufacturing Council? This report results from a study of 700 companies. Can the Minister inform the Senate of details of this report and the importance of the companies surveyed to future economic growth?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="5165" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point of Senator Devereux's question is important following on Senator Short's question. The McKinsey report, commissioned by the Australian Manufacturing Council, was a survey of 700 new exporting companies in Australia. It underlines the importance of small to medium size manufacturing exports. These exports are increasingly important. Increasingly, the wealthy countries of the world are the ones that produce sophisticated manufactured goods. Unless we in Australia produce more of these goods and sell them internationally, we will not be able to pay our way in this world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition, of course, will not like this report because it threatens to puncture its present euphoria about Australia's current economic difficulties. The report shows that many small and medium sized companies are recording significant successes in international markets. The survey identified 700 of these manufacturers which have rapidly increased exports over the past five years. These companies now earn Australia about $8 billion a year. McKinsey predicts that this export income will grow to $15 billion over the next five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 700 companies concerned are companies which have a new export culture. I have visited and talked to many of them. They are high value-added manufacturers, innovative young companies, run by a new generation of business people. Many of these companies once concentrated on the domestic market only but, in recent years, they have got into exports. There are plenty of examples of those. The Opposition, which gets all its policies from a paid think-tank, would probably not be aware of the existence of many of these companies. The fact of the matter is that they are there and I have visited many of them. They are very important in the changing and diverse pattern of Australian trade, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the survey for serious study. If members of the Opposition can get a look at it before Friday, it would be very good for them; it would be very helpful. It would save them visiting any of these places. They might understand some of the problems which are realistic problems as distinct from theoretical ones identified by paid policy providers of the Opposition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Did the report provide any information on the importance of Asian markets to the 700 countries surveyed? As the economic recovery gathers pace, is there a danger that these companies will refocus on the domestic market at the expense of exports?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="5165" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the historic experience under conservative governments in this country that new exporting companies tend to fall back into supplying the domestic market in a period of growth. That was not the experience from 1985 to 1990 in a period of high economic growth in Australia. Manufacturing exports grew by approximately 15 per cent a year throughout that period&mdash;a period when one would normally have expected them to fall backwards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the companies surveyed, as the senator points out by implication in his question, are committed very strongly to Asian markets. There are a variety of reasons for that, including niche opportunities and the same time zone. These companies now see exports as critical to their success and survival. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for every other company in Australia.</PARA>

I draw the Minister's attention to the peripatetic $4m-odd debt owed by Mr Keating's piggery group to his former ministerial colleague, Mr John Brown, and to the fact that there are now three different versions of this debt. Can the Minister advise what action can be taken to establish which version of the Keating piggery group's unsigned, unaudited accounts, all of which are in breach of ASC requirements, should be believed: that showing the group owing Mr Brown a debt of about $4m; that showing the debt shuffled out of the group's liabilities into shareholders' equity; or the latest corrected return required by the ASC showing the debt reshuffled into a contingent liability? I ask the Minister whether the present corporations law permits this kind of paper shuffling that significantly alters a company's apparent financial position?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This industry has had difficulties and has been at the eye of the storm in industry restructuring in Australia. But the report of the TCFDA, which was tabled in the Senate yesterday, gives grounds for renewed confidence in the future of the TCF industries and the belief that they can and will be successful in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the financial year 1991-92 a total of $220m was invested in the industries and total profits were $276m. For the most part, these industries have put behind the sterile debate about the level of tariff and other protection&mdash;although Senator Spindler is still raising that issue from time to time. Throughout the country, TCF companies are getting on with the work needed to ensure the future of their businesses. They realise that future will depend on international competitiveness, not tariffs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past 20 years the international marketplace for TCF products has been transformed by the emergence of powerful new industries in the Asia-Pacific region. Fierce competition from countries in this region has been the inducement to improve competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employment levels in the TCF industries have fallen, but the major decline in TCF employment predates the announcement of an accelerated tariff phasedown in March 1991. TCF employment largely fell while the level of protection was steady and high. The TCFDA annual report says that employment in the industry fell 2 per cent in 1991-92 compared with 11 per cent in the previous year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear from the report that the restructuring, particularly of the textile industry, is well under way. Government policies have played an important part in this. The annual report takes nine pages to list the companies which have received support. That is because the Government has devoted $160m in direct funding to assist restructuring in these industries. The import credit scheme is in addition to that. So it is time that people who talk down the future of the industries in this country stop; it is a hangover from a previous debate. I am very optimistic about the future of the successful restructured TCF industries in this country.</PARA>

That is in contradistinction, for example, to the equivalent industries in Europe which are major exporters and also significant importers. Clothing and footwear exports have increased by over 280 per cent since 1986-87, although that has been from a low base, as I have pointed out.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can certainly give Senator Spindler those assurances. The Government has absolutely no intention of selling Telecom.

I will provide some little detail, but I have to say that the best way of ensuring that AOTC does not slide into a non-profit situation against the competition from Optus&mdash;I know that AOTC is committed to this course&mdash;is for AOTC to provide the aggressive, successful, competitive service against Optus that it intends to provide. That will be the best guarantee that it will continue to be the successful company that it now is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government established AOTC on a firm commercial basis to ensure that it is in a position to provide that kind of competition and to compete on an equal footing with the second telecommunications carrier and in the international telecommunications marketplace. In establishing AOTC the Government decided last year to convert $2 billion in Commonwealth loans to equity over five years. In providing the additional capital, the Government believes that AOTC will become a world class telecommunications carrier capable of delivering services of the best international standard to consumers and providing taxpayers with a commercial rate of return on their investment in AOTC through dividend payments to the Federal Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the public statement issued in 1991, Mr Beazley  indicated that AOTC would not be expected to supply any inter-connection facilities at charges less than cost to them. In addition, the Government has ensured that initial incremental charges for Optus to access the AOTC network have market share triggers to indicate when these charges may be commercially negotiated. We expect that to happen some time next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These principles are set out in the Ministerial (Inter-connection and Related Charging Principles) Determination of November 1991. For example, initial charges for all domestic traffic can be renegotiated once Optus has gained 20 per cent of the total minutes of domestic traffic within Australia. This will ensure that the revenue that AOTC derives from providing inter-connection will increase as the Optus market share increases.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support aware of the growing complaints of industry about the stalled micro-reform process, as expressed in the Industry Commission's annual report? It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In some areas reform has produced productivity gains but gains do not seem to have passed on to users. Shipping is a frequently cited example.</PARA>

<PARA>Can Australian business look forward to an end to what yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> calls `the high cost of cabotage', or is shipping what the Prime Minister referred to when he said on 2 December `the big agenda of the mid-80s is largely behind us', and on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> when he said that micro-reform was `mostly completed' and `what else do you want me to do?'?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Cabinet deliberations on shipping reform will remain confidential; I will not comment on the media speculation about them. Shipping reform in Australia is widely perceived as a model of non-confrontationist, non-divisive reform which has achieved significant gains and improvement for Australian ship users. Just the other day an international shipper was in my office and said, `In the old days before you effected this reform, we could be absolutely sure when our ships would arrive in Australia&mdash;we couldn't be sure when they would depart. Now we can be sure of both. Thank you very much, government, for enabling that reform to occur'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of our reform, the average crew has been reduced by 25 per cent, from 28 on average to under 21 crew members, thereby matching the level of OECD ships visiting Australia; new ships are now being introduced with crews of 17, compared to 21 three years ago; increased labour productivity over the life of the program will result in long term savings of $50m per annum to the industry; retraining has been provided to more than 1,900 seafarers to facilitate crew reductions through multi-skilling; and industrial disputation has fallen, with only 70 ship days lost in 1992, compared to 1,593 ship days lost in the last year of the coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's reform program has meant that investors in the industry have been encouraged, and they have invested nearly $2 billion in the launching of 31 more new, modern ships for Australia, with another five on order. That is a mark of the confidence that industry has had in the cooperative and harmonious reform climate we have created on the Australian coast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of cabotage, the coalition leaves me aghast. What does it want on the Australian coast? Does it want a rust bucket crewed by Asian crews living on a grain of rice a day and a kick up the backside to keep them interested? Is that what the Opposition wants? The Australian industry is a highly trained, highly skilled and highly efficient industry that delivers a very good service that is valued by its users.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The Industry Commission recognises the reforms that have taken place but also recognises that the savings have not been passed on to exporters. My supplementary question is: is the Government's excuse for not taking away cabotage that we want to single-handedly solve the problem of the world's dilapidated shipping fleet, at great cost to our exporters and particularly exporters from Western Australia; or is it that Senator Cook does not want to cause any problems with his union mates prior to the next election? What is the reason?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought it would be the case that today Senator Campbell would try to work into a question some reference to my alleged union mates. It may escape the notice of the Opposition that this Government acts on principle to bring about reforms in the best interests of the nation without regard to the particular interests of any group, and that concerns some of those people who argue about things that Senator Campbell has just argued about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said at the beginning of my answer that I will not comment on confidential deliberations of Cabinet. They will be announced in due course. The honourable senator will have to sit quietly and wait for us to do so and respond, if he chooses, then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Collins pointed out in a number of interjections, the Industry Commission report should be read in full and not selectively. If it is, and if it is not used as some sort of selective stick to beat us with but rather as a comprehensive understanding of reform, I do not think Senator Campbell will find very much support at all for his contentions.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NE4">Senator BEAHAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to claims by the shadow Minister for arts and heritage, Senator Michael Baume, that grants to the film industry would be heavily cut under a coalition government in favour of a system of tax incentives for private investors? Has the Government any plans to implement such changes? Secondly, based on previous experience with film financing under division 10BA of the taxation Act, what would be the likely net effect on government outlays of the proposed reductions in grants when offset against the loss in revenue resulting from the tax incentives? What would be the likely effect on the quality of film production and the level of Australian involvement in such production?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="5175" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of those statements because they were enunciated by the shadow Minister recently at a conference of the Screen Production Association, where they went down like a lead balloon, not surprisingly. The Government has no plans whatever to implement this appalling policy proposal. The current film support arrangements were developed following extensive consultation with the film industry, and they resulted in a stable industry at a lower cost to government than previous schemes but without diminishing the quality of Australian films. The 10BA scheme, established in 1981, resulted in a blow-out in the cost to revenue and rortings by some investors. There is no doubt that that occurred. A return to such a tax driven scheme is highly likely to result in the same problems, and Senator Baume knows it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current system of the Government provides primary support for film production through investment in the Film Finance Corporation. The system has resulted in increased involvement by active investors, which is essential for the development of market skills in the Australian production sector and long term viability. The Government's financial commitment to this very important industry is substantial. Funding for the Film Finance Corporation is $61.9m in this financial year with funding committed until 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This financial commitment, the increased active involvement of the private sector and the Corporation's earnings from the films in which it invests are factors which are contributing to stable production levels and a healthy domestic film industry. The need for stability was emphasised at the recent Screen Production Association conference which I addressed and, as I said, where Senator Baume's proposals went down like a lead balloon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that the Opposition&mdash;and this is in the Fightback document&mdash;plans to slash $27m from government support for film and $42m overall from the arts portfolio. Senator Baume does understand that this tax proposal will not work. It is a very thin attempt indeed to hide the fact that Fightback currently proposes to emasculate funding for the film industry and for arts generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, on Friday, this turns out to be another bundle that Dr Hewson has dropped, no-one will believe it. Everyone knows that the Opposition is committed to these levels of funding. If anyone is foolish enough to believe the Opposition, he or she will find out after the election&mdash;should the Opposition be elected&mdash;when it goes back to this scheme. Senator Baume knows that these proposals will not work and his attempt to disguise this funding cut by going back to a failed scheme has impressed no-one.</PARA>

As you have, in effect, indicated that you do, I ask specifically: was the payment made to the Speaker of the House of Representatives? Was the claim for falling off his bicycle in the parliamentary precinct? Did you approve the payment? As you and the Speaker are jointly responsible for this Department, did somebody represent the Speaker in approving the payment? What were the grounds of the claim?</PARA></TALK.START>

I believe this was a legal case which the Speaker took against the Joint House Department.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I refer the Minister to the lodging of a log of claims by the CFMEU to establish an award on over 1,500 building companies which engage independent contractors. This proposed award is designed to bring independent contractors in the building and construction industry under award conditions. The claim includes: increases in real wages of 5 per cent a year over and above productivity improvements; a 30-hour working week to be cut by 5 per cent per year; weekend work at quadruple time and a half; eight weeks annual leave; 30 public holidays a year; and that every employee shall be required to become and remain a financial member of the union. In view of the fact that the Minister stated the legislation was introduced to stop sham contracts, will the Government be amending the legislation to stop such outrageous claims?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. By way of preface to my answer, I am about to prove the truth of what I said. I have in front of me a facsimile message from a Mr Glenn Simpson, Director of Industrial Relations of the Master Builders Construction and Housing Association in Canberra, to `All IR Managers'. This circular is relevant to the question asked by Senator Crane. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have also been made aware of a new development in HIA's misinformation campaign over independent contractors.</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate: the same misinformation contained in this question. The circular goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CFMEU is currently engaged in roping in various small builders as respondents to the NBCIA Award. HIA is representing this as a new claim using s.127A of the Act to unionise subcontractors&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I emphasise this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which is of course completely untrue.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Master Builders Association, an employer organisation in competition with the HIA. What does it say of the same allegation contained in the question? `Which is of course completely untrue'. Let me go on with the quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is no more what the unions have done for very many years to extend coverage of an existing Award by adding eligible parties. It is interesting that on the terms of the HIA's own letter, the Log of Claims which the HIA refers to was served on 17 July 1992 before the new independent contractor provisions came into operation.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what an employer organisation says of the HIA allegations which are the foundation of Senator Crane's question and the reason why I say his question is based on a false premise and is not true.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. This log of claims, which obviously was prepared prior to this legislation becoming law and in anticipation of its becoming law, makes it quite clear in the second point that in fact it is to cover independent contractors, and it is being done under section 195(1A) of the legislation which the Minister introduced into this place. When I asked the Minister whether he intends introducing legislation to force contractors to operate within the award system, he said no. Why did the Minister mislead this chamber by giving that answer at that time?</PARA></TALK.START>

If building people are unfairly and improperly dealt with in a harsh and unfair way, they ought to have that avenue. I do not believe that the legislation we introduced applies to the building industry. Nonetheless, the HIA has persisted in this campaign not because it is true but because it wants to make a political point against the Government.

<PARA>We have heard some fairly disgraceful responses to nonsensical questions in the past during Question Time, but this was one of the most appallingly bad responses we have ever heard, in terms both of its integrity and the facts on which it was based. The fact is that this Government is reducing grants to the Film Finance Corporation from last year's $68m to $50m&mdash;a reduction of $18m&mdash;by 1995-96. That $18m cut was not referred to by the Minister in his disgraceful response. Yet he made great play of the fact that in our term in office we would reduce it by $2m more, by $20m. What a disgraceful response from this Minister. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister seeks to correct himself. The cut that we talked about was $20m from last year's level. The Minister knows what Fightback says, so I can only assume that his interjection was based on a deliberate purpose to mislead. We have a situation where both parties are of the view that there is an excessive dependence on grants in the film industry for a very good reason, and that is that  $100 of grant to the film industry results in only $100 getting to the film industry. However, $100 of tax benefit, of tax deduction, for private investors brings $250 to the film industry because it gears up private sector contributions. Both parties agree, despite the fact that the Minister comes in here and masquerades as some kind of phoney defender of films when he is, in fact, a party to a continuing reduction in the grant money being made available to the film industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aside from that phoney masquerade, let us see what the reality is. Under our policies, the reduction in grants will be replaced&mdash;and, one would hope, massively overwhelmed&mdash;by a major increase in private sector funding by providing assistance more by way of tax deduction than by way of grant. We can see what has happened under this Government to tax deductions. On top of this Government chopping grants to the industry, it has also massively reduced the amount of money it is making available by way of tax deduction. In 1987-88, tax relief totalling $131m was made available to private sector contributors to the film industry. By last year this had fallen by two-thirds, to only $43m. So, on both scores, the Government is cutting the grants and reducing the amount of money available by way of tax deduction, providing no incentives whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the coalition would have the same order of grants cuts as the Government, but basically would be seeking to replace that money by significant changes in the way people can get tax deductions for investing in the film industry. Under us there will be a big increase in total funding available to film. Under this Government, the amount has been falling dramatically and consistently, both by way of reduction of grant and by way of reduction of tax incentives available for people to invest in the film industry. The Minister's answer was an absolute disgrace in the way he misrepresented the impact of this Government in cutting film funding. </PARA>

<PARA>At Question Time the Minister said that I should place the request for information on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. I find that a quaint answer indeed because, in effect, that request for information has been on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> since 3 November 1992, when I asked Senator Evans a question in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I simply ask whether Senator Evans will supply the Senate with the precise dates on which those conversations took place&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>between him and Mr Dawkins. I also asked whether the Minister would table any written correspondence in the Senate concerning the appointments of Mr Boucher and the withdrawal of Mr Borthwick from Paris. I further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to see the terms and conditions of the appointments of Mr Borthwick and Mr Boucher, including the relative salaries and perks that go with them. I also ask the Minister to advise me and to advise the Senate what previous offers were made to Mr Borthwick prior to the one that was tantamount to a recall.</PARA>
<PARA>On that occasion, Senator Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no terms yet identified for Mr Boucher's appointment because that appointment has not yet been made, but I will be happy to make that available at the appropriate time.</PARA>
<PARA>In answer to my main question, Senator Evans said earlier that Mr Boucher was someone in whom he personally had absolute confidence. The Minister also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The formal recommendation has not yet gone to the Governor-General. It will in a matter of days.</PARA>
<PARA>But certainly he had made the decision and he would be making the recommendation. In other words, on 3 November, the Minister told the Senate that he would make the recommendation in a number of days and that he would make the information `available at the appropriate time' which, of course, would follow the making of the recommendation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Crane this day, relating to the position of independent contractors in the industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to make a few brief comments about the answer that I was given today by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). The Minister claimed that my question was based on a false premise. In fact, he said that it was an untruthful question. I want to make the point that it was not based on a false premise. It was based on what has happened to some 1,500 building companies which engage principally independent contractors and which many have never had a log of claims served on them before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 received royal assent some eight to nine days prior to that log of claims being lodged. But that is totally irrelevant to what I was asking. The relevant point is that amendments made to that Act changed the definition of an employee so that it was possible for this log of claims to be lodged against building companies that engage independent contractors. That was the basis of my question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly want to refer Senator Cook to a quote from his second reading speech on the Contractors Bill. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Independent contractors will not be made into employees&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and clearly the changes in the Act do make them into employees&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and will not be subject to the award system generally. The new arrangements will operate only on a case by case basis, not on a general or class action basis.</PARA>
<PARA>In addition to that, in answer to another question I asked, which I have already referred to here today, the Minister gave a categorical `no' as to whether this legislation</PARA>
<PARA>will bring independent contractors under the award system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence is absolutely clear that under this legislation independent contractors will be in time brought into the award system. That was the basis of the question I asked today. I also made reference to the outrageous claims that were being made. If the Minister is to maintain the integrity of the statements in his second reading speech and the integrity of his answers to my questions, he has no option but to amend this legislation to stop what is happening. We should return to the original intent of the legislation, which the Minister said was to deal with sham contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Of course, the most outrageous part of this log of claims is the order that is being sought from the Industrial Relations Commission to ensure that all people employed must be and continue to be financial members of the union.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I am flabbergasted. Try as I may to educate Senator Crane in what the Act really means, I find that he either is unable to understand a simple proposition or deliberately avoids understanding it. He put a proposition to me in a question; I responded by making an assertion that it was untrue and produced evidence to prove I was right. What has Senator Crane done? He has said I am wrong, and his way of establishing that is simply by asserting, and not proving a damn thing. In terms of the scales of logic here, I win, he loses; that is the outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us go to some of the other facts that I did not have time to cover in a three-minute answer. Senator Crane has said&mdash;and I think I have him down correctly as a quote&mdash;`The evidence is absolutely clear that it is bringing these people into the award', or words to that effect. The evidence is not absolutely clear at all. There is no evidence to support that proposition because the claim that has been referred to was a log of claims on 23 July, as the Master Builders Association says, of its rival employer organisation, the HIA, before this legislation was in force. The log of claims of 23 July sought to cover exclusively conditions with employees. Read the log of claims. It refers to employees; it does not refer to contractors. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not refer to contractors; it refers to employees. It is what the technicians of industrial relations appearing before the Commission call, and in the parlance of arbitration is known as, `a roping-in application'. These are potential respondents to a Federal award who are not at the moment respondents, who are served by a claim to enable an arbitrator to decide, if the point is contested, whether or not they ought to be covered by an award. So there is no irrefutable evidence here of anything at all, except that in the view of this particular union those particular employers ought to be covered by an award in so far as their employees are concerned. It has nothing to do with their contractors, if they have any, but only with their employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be a union view that the employees of this company are entitled to be covered by an award, and that view may be right. But it has not been tested yet. The obvious response of the employers, if they disagree, will be to contest. It will go to arbitration and go through a process of hearing and determination to find out what is right. If the Commission errs at law, it will go through the courts system on appeal to make the law right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crane has no evidence whatsoever to support his contention, which leads me to the next consideration: why in the absence of any evidence does he persist in making the assertions he does?

<PARA>The Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) said that this matter of the piggeries of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is not one of substance because it has not been raised in the House of Representatives, apparently justifying the failure of the Government to ever answer substantially any matters of substance that I raise here and to instead depend entirely and basically on personal abuse. </PARA>

I remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that in the House of Representatives questions run for about 15 seconds and replies go on for a quarter of an hour.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the report tabled by the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Cook. We face an eternal problem in this place of being presented with too little time to pursue reports&mdash;in the case of this document around 100 pages of a highly technical argument and a highly complex legal and procedural argument. None of us has had the time to go through it line by line and ponder what is in it. With that proviso, the report's key points are very clear and they are as Senator Cook said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is a devastating record of professional incompetence. It confirms my worst fears about the management of the Civil Aviation Authority. It is not correct to see this report in relation to only one matter; namely, the CAA's contract evaluation. It goes across the whole of the operations of the CAA and raises some very profound questions. What I have to say this afternoon is largely critical. I am sorry that Senator Cook is no longer here, but I must comment at the outset on Senator Cook's place in relation to this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He inherited this mess in the middle of the year. He has discharged his duties as Minister in an impeccable and laudable manner, showing great integrity and promptness in dealing with this issue. The integrity is most important but, in dealing with a matter of this nature, the readiness to get on with the task and redress what might be wrong is equally important. I believe that Senator Cook deserves great praise for his actions in relation to this report. He inherited a situation that was not of his making. He is a person of not much aviation background or knowledge, and very little background, I would imagine, in a technical sense. But he stands out as a shining example of what a Minister should do in these circumstances. He has proved the old adage which those of us in politics sometimes recognise it takes a great act of faith to honour or to understand; that is, that virtue brings its own reward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To set the report in context, this was an inquiry into a very expensive new nationwide air traffic control system. I have always been interested in aviation. I have had grave concerns in recent years about the operation of the Civil Aviation Authority in general, and the way we embarked on a new system without any in-depth analysis and without cost-benefit analyses&mdash;we just had a system imposed on us de novo, at great expense&mdash;aroused my interest. The first public announcement that the Australian companies would be denied the right to tender as prime contractors in that process further heightened my interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world of Australian aviation is relatively small and once I took a public position a lot of people came and talked to me. So I have followed this program through. It was a program that struck me as being highly irregular from the outset. Over the last 30 years in this country we have set in place certain procedures to guarantee that the selection of major contracts is on a basis that preserves the integrity of the selection process. It does not guarantee in any way at all that we always get the right result. But in the past we have always been free of the charge that there was something funny about the way the decision was arrived at to benefit one or other of the tenderers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case a highly irregular selection procedure was adopted by the Civil Aviation Authority. I emphasise that that in itself is not a criticism or an indication that there would be a wrong result or that corruption may be involved. But it is an indication that there is an obligation placed on the people adopting that system to be quite transparent about the way they arrived at the decision, because the Government and statutory authorities are vested by this Parliament with the right to raise taxes, and the right to raise taxes carries with it a concomitant obligation to explain and account for how those funds are spent. That obligation of accountability is something that the Civil Aviation Authority never measured up to and never met at any time through this extraordinary saga of events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns about the process were not based on party lines; they were bipartisan. All parties within this Parliament and both Houses of the Parliament&mdash;both the House of Representatives and the Senate&mdash;were concerned about the selection process. I would like to particularly mention the Public Works Committee because the Chairman and the members of that Committee without exception faithfully discharged their responsibilities under the Act in relation to the expenditure of public funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the ironies of this situation is that, had the Civil Aviation Authority been one bit more intelligent, had it recognised that what we were telling it was its obligation under law, and had it answered the questions, this inquiry would never have been set up. These people would never have been exposed for the incompetent people they were, because neither the members of the Parliament nor the Public Works Committee would have gone behind the evidence, had it been freely given to them. So there is a very ironic twist to the situation we have today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My primary concern in this matter was the matter of accountability, as I have said. The Civil Aviation Authority absolutely failed to account for its actions when it was called upon by properly constituted authorities to do so. In fact, in my time in the Parliament I have never met people like Mr Baldwin and Dr Edwards who blatantly and obstinately refused to cooperate with the demands of the Parliament&mdash;and they deserve everything that is coming to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The synopsis of the report has been given by Senator Cook and I do not wish to go into that in much detail. I make the general observation that the text is restrained; it is undemonstrative; it is under-stated. It reflects the great tact and courtesy of its author, Mr Macphee. Any person taking time to read the report must read between the lines, because there is a great degree of under-statement. I have not had time to reflect fully on the final chapter of the book which goes into the procedures of the board, but clearly there is a mine of information there for quiet reflection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does emerge is the fact that we had a wilful&mdash;and I use that word in a literal sense&mdash;chief executive officer in Mr Baldwin who, along with his faithful lieutenant or lap-dog, Dr Edwards, rode roughshod over what was a weak and compliant board in the Civil Aviation Authority. The report is redolent with examples of sloppy business practices adopted by the board. I will quote some examples of that. The report states on page 62:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the vital nature of this Management Evaluation Team meeting, as the basis of what was intended to be the Board's decision on the preferred bidder for TAAATS, the "minutes" of that meeting were not written until three months after the meeting when two worried directors, Messrs Mant and Ayres requested copies of these and other documents which were relied upon by management in making its recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Butcher and his Board were completely unaware of the fact that they received crucial advice from a meeting for which minutes did not exist.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on and on. There is evidence in the report of clear bias by Mr Baldwin&mdash;a man with no technical education at all; a man with very limited managerial experience running a big operation in the Civil Aviation Authority; a man whose sole claim to fame was the fact that he was a real estate agent in a small New Zealand town, with a chequered career in that town. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to pages 53 and 85, and deal with the matter of bias. One of the themes that emerges is that the board was not fully advised all the time. The advice it got was biased towards one of the two contenders all the way. The board was known to be sensitive to risks and delays in major electronic contracts. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Board's past experiences had predisposed them to being extremely concerned about development risk and potential time delays. It is difficult to imagine how Mr Baldwin, as a Board member, could not have realised the arresting effect this proviso would have on the other directors. Executive Management and Mr Baldwin highlighted the risks associated with Hughes <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">despite the fact that the operational and technical evaluations had taken account of risk and Hughes had still been evaluated as the top bidder</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on and on, leading to the conclusions of the report. Page 88 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under no test of fair play or professional competence could the methods of inquiry or the quality of the conclusions during the post-December 1991 phase be regarded as being adequate.</PARA>
<PARA>Page 90 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The advice to the Board by Mr Baldwin and Dr Edwards was fatally flawed. It was inadequately researched and tested. Hughes were not assessed fairly.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>The inquiry makes the point that it did not explore criminality at all. It did not explore, in any detail, the abundant evidence that bias existed in the selection process. It rested its case on the fact that there was a mountain of evidence of gross professional incompetence in the selection process and, indeed, that is enough to damn the process irrevocably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no quarrel with the recommendations of the report; I think they are fair and reasonable given all the circumstances. I can see that Siemens Plessey has grounds to feel aggrieved. It was technically competent, able to perform the contract in time and, by all accounts, it was by far and away the lowest tenderer. In the same category, Raytheon could well feel that it has been disadvantaged in being debarred initially from being a contractor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So much for what is in the report. Where do we go from here? The first thing that must happen is that the two principal officers named, Messrs Baldwin and Edwards, should be fired by the board. They should not be given the luxury of tendering their resignations. The report really delineates the inadequacies in the selection process and fully substantiates them. It leaves it broadly to the board to correct those deficiencies and, indeed, that is the burden of the tabling statement made by the Minister a few moments ago. In dealing with the response he expects from the board, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In seeking that response, I am asking that the board not only advise me of their views and proposed actions in relation to the recommendations and findings of the review, but also their response to other matters which have been the subject of adverse comment in the report . . .</PARA>
<PARA>So it is really up to the board to take the requisite action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I offer the advice to the Minister that if the board does not act promptly and demand the resignation of those two officers, the Minister should dismiss the board. In any case, the position of the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of the CAA is totally untenable and intolerable. They cannot remain in that position and they must go. I suspect that the majority of the board members also should fall on their swords and depart public life. It is not clear from the report whether all the members acted negligently. Clearly, there is reference to two board members who questioned some of the inadequate procedures that were in place, but the majority of the board members failed to exercise the responsibilities that are vested in them under law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not only one incident of incompetence on the part of the board in this tender selection process. There have been three cases in the last few years of a prima facie conflict of interest where members of the CAA board have had commercial negotiations with the Civil Aviation Authority&mdash;something that is absolutely intolerable. The board has shown no insight at all into the seriousness of these charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put on the record that one of the members of that board, Mr Yates, sat next to one of the best known members of the Australian Parliament on an aircraft flight in Australia. Mr Yates recognised the parliamentarian. The parliamentarian did not recognise Mr Yates. Mr Yates engaged the parliamentarian in conversation and immediately moved to a massive attack on me and the place I have had in setting up this report. He accused me of involving the civil aviation industry in the expenditure of millions of dollars&mdash;absolutely nonsensical. Then we had the way the board underwrote the pursuit of a Mr Tom Burton and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> with public funds for merely reporting some of the procedures in Parliament; that is quite intolerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other person who has to answer for his actions is the former Minister in this portfolio, Senator Collins. The attacks that Senator Collins made on me were legion, and unfortunately for him they are preserved for posterity.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins attacked me in grossly intemperate language. I do not mind that. It is quite proper for Senator Collins to defend his point of view in the political arena. Senator Collins's crime was that he failed to exercise prudence by confirming whether there was any substance to the allegations raised in public about the conduct involved. He responded in an unintelligent and bullying way to all that criticism. He failed to make any inquiries to establish whether the allegations were correct. Furthermore, he defended the CAA. On one occasion, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to get one thing absolutely clear. The officers of the CAA have been constantly vilified and defamed in print. I think it is outrageous that Mr Baldwin and Dr Edwards were named in a newspaper the other day. . . </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to comment on the Civil Aviation Authority itself. This great authority has been in decline for 20 years, ever since Mr Charles Jones and Mr Gough Whitlam merged the old Department of Civil Aviation into a transport authority. It has now gone to extremes. It is run by money-grubbers, professional business managers and single issue people&mdash;ideologues pursuing concepts like user pays. It is now very low in professional expertise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are great and dedicated people still within the Department, but they are almost incapable of being effective. We had the nonsensical situation the other day when the Civil Aviation Authority made a big play out of hiring public relations consultants to oversight its safety procedures. An unknown overseas private company is to advise on the correctness of Australia's civil aviation safety procedures for the next three years. This is required to give an imprimatur of respectability to the CAA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Donald Anderson or Dickie Williams would turn in their graves. The world used to beat a path to the doors of the old Australian Department of Civil Aviation to find out how safety standards should be implemented. That act of hiring a public safety adviser is parallelled only by the extraordinary situation of hiring a Mr Richard Farmer to act as a lobbyist between the CAA and a Labor Government&mdash;a move that is quite extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole of the operation of the CAA now is suspect. I do not say that lightly. As an old airman, I have very grave fears about the safety of aviation in this country&mdash;something that is quite different from the matter which is before us today in this air traffic control report. The risk of a major aviation disaster in Australia is now very high. We are in a situation that is similar to that in the 1960s, when we lost three Viscounts. The lesson that emerged from that was that the Australian public will not tolerate an abasement of the safety standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to change the whole culture of the CAA. We need to get away from the money-grubbers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like Senator MacGibbon, I have not had any greater opportunity than he has had of reading the report in detail. But there are two matters that I noted in the report which I will deal with first before I actually turn to some of the more general comments made by Senator MacGibbon about the CAA and about the job that it currently does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 64 of the report there is a reference to a meeting where the author of the report talks about&mdash;and this was in fact the crucial meeting, which interestingly enough was on Friday the 13th&mdash;the absence from that meeting of Mr Yates, who has just been mentioned in not particularly glowing terms by Senator MacGibbon, and of Mr Baillieu. I mention this because in a number of places in this report the author uses the term `atmospherics'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The atmospherics created by this reference indicate that two of these members had experience in aspects of aviation and so on; in other words, two of the more technically competent people on the board&mdash;and I know that both of them are aviators&mdash;were absent from the meeting. The impression is created therefore that they did not have the opportunity to express a view on the preferred contractors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put a caveat on this comment because I am in the position of Senator MacGibbon and everyone else in that I have not had time to read the report as fully as I shall. I do not doubt for a minute that it will not be the last we hear of it, so I am not concerned about contributing to the debate at this stage. But from my recollection of the events surrounding this meeting, there is an important matter which, if my memory serves me correctly, is omitted from this report but which is very relevant to Mr Yates and Mr Baillieu. This was a recollection I have of a conversation that I had with some board members at the time about what was a very finely balanced judgment process.

Before she goes too hard on it, I suggest she does Mr Macphee the credit of at least reading his report to see what he has to say about that. I have a clear recollection in respect of that meeting from which Mr Yates and Mr Baillieu were absent. The inference created here is that they did not have an opportunity to express a view and the inference clearly hanging in the air&mdash;there is no question about it&mdash;is that, if they had been there to express a view, it would have been a different view to the one that was expressed. I think any fair reading of the document would indicate that. My clear recollection is that not only did they have a strong view but also that strong view was in favour of selecting Thomson on the basis of their assessment of risk&mdash;and it did come down to that in the finish&mdash;for the CAA in getting burnt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to commend Mr Macphee for the way he has grounded this report in the background he has given to how these board members came into their jobs and how the chief executive came into his job. Mr Macphee lays that out very well. They were preoccupied, as Mr Macphee says&mdash;and they were&mdash;with the question of placing the CAA at significant financial exposure, considering what had previously happened. Senator MacGibbon is as aware of what previously happened as I was. I think it would be fair to say that Senator MacGibbon strongly supported the changes that were made in the then management of the CAA and its restructuring. I see that he is nodding in assent. It is in that atmosphere, which Mr Macphee has accurately laid out in the report, that they came into this job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My recollection is very clear. My recollection is that not only did Mr Yates and Mr Baillieu have a clear preference for Thomson on the question of risk assessment for the organisation, that it was a safer bet, a more tried bet&mdash;and that is what it really came down to in the finish&mdash;but also that they had provided formal proxies to the Chairman of the Board, Mr Butcher, which he then exercised on their behalf. They cast their votes by proxies which they provided in favour of Thomson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to put this on the record now so it can be checked&mdash;but I place the caveat on it that I am relying on my memory because I have only really had an opportunity to flick through this report today&mdash;that I am sure that that is correct. I will check it as soon as I leave the chamber. If it is correct, I think that it is an unfortunate omission from the report. I am not criticising the report's accuracy. I think the details that have been laid out are accurate. In fact, I think most of the report that I have seen is accurate in terms of the picture it paints. But I am certain that Mr Yates and Mr Baillieu, although they were physically absent from the meeting, formally provided written proxies to the Chairman of the Board and that their views, therefore, were not only known but counted at the meeting in terms of those proxies. </PARA>

It was in the company of a number of other people, including, I think he said, the Assistant Secretary of the Committee. He said that that information had not been sought by Mr Macphee from him and it had not been proffered. I am, therefore, forced to believe, until Mr Macphee tells me differently, that Mr Macphee relied for that information on a column in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> which in very graphic terms described a totally untrue event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say on this occasion in deference to the author of that article, whom I have criticised in the past but whom I do not criticise on this occasion, that I do not doubt that somebody in this hotbed of intrigue, Parliament House, conveyed to the author of that article, Mr Burton, that those events occurred. They did not ever occur. That has also been confirmed by Mr Hollis in a conversation that I had with him yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I raise that is that it is important to note, in respect of the so-called wrath visited on Mr Hollis, that I have not had an angry conversation with Mr Hollis in my life. I have had a number of dealings with Mr Hollis in relation to the third runway construction at Sydney Airport. We moved a motion of urgency in the House of Representatives that he took amiss, and he said so. He was defending his Committee, rightly, as its Chairman. I understand that. We had an amiable conversation about that privately. He certainly trounced me publicly on that occasion for outrageously overturning a reference to the Committee of the third runway issue. I do not apologise for that, by the way; I think that was the correct decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously I have had discussions with him related to defence housing matters in the Northern Territory. I had a number of conversations with Mr Hollis about this important question of the CAA. They were not only amicable but positive and constructive. They all related to matters that led to the establishment of this independent inquiry, which I felt, finally, was absolutely the only course of action that could be adopted and set into train the processes that brought it into being. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly on one of those occasions in which I had a discussion with Mr Hollis I suggested to him, in the presence of my staff&mdash;at that stage simply as an option&mdash;one way of addressing the serious concerns that the Public Works Committee had.

I suggested that one of the options that may resolve the difficulty for the Committee would be an independent inquiry into this entire matter, into the CAA. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure Senator Macdonald that there is no disagreement between Senator Schacht and me on this. In fact, one of the results of all of this was the bringing to Cabinet, with my full support&mdash;Senator Button and I consulted widely on this&mdash;of a submission, referred to by the Minister in his tabling statement, to set up new arrangements in respect of GBEs generally and purchasing policy. That has been developed over a long period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things I have to say&mdash;and Senator MacGibbon raised it, and correctly, I think&mdash;is that one of my concerns very early in this portfolio was that the Government had set GBEs up as commercial enterprises. I disagree with Senator MacGibbon; I think that it is an appropriate, correct and, indeed, largely successful way of operating. In opening the first stage of the new international airport terminal at Melbourne last night&mdash;and I am about to go and open the new international terminal in Sydney on Friday&mdash;I think it is obviously that there are GBEs that perform spectacularly well in this fashion&mdash;as does the CAA generally. Despite his criticisms, Senator MacGibbon, would have to concede that a long term overdue process of reform has been expeditiously carried out inside that organisation. Restructuring has been undertaken that has turned in savings to the industry of $96m in charges last year alone. But one of the problems in this process is that the boards of these organisations, who are almost all responsible for employing their own senior staff&mdash;not the Government&mdash;go out into private industry, recruit the best people that they can, which is what happened in this case, and then these people from private industry come in, take the job, get on with the job thinking that it is a commercial company, and say, `What are Senate Estimates committees? What is the Public Works committee? We did not know that we had to go and address that. What is the Caucus Committee on Transport and Communications?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason that I raise that point is that in respect of this matter, particularly, those senior officers, at one stage, did almost nothing else except track from one Government committee to another for hours at a time. It came as a shock to Mr Baldwin to discover the reality of these parliamentary processes to which organisations which he expected to run as a commercial enterprise and as a regulator are subjected. That is a matter that I have raised a number of times with my colleagues in Cabinet. But when the situation got to the point where the matters raised by the Joint Committee on Public Works had reached a certain point, I considered that the only way of resolving them was by an independent inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I make that point is in direct reference to this assertion in the report about the so-called wrathful relationship I had with Mr Hollis, which did not exist; it was the reverse. I can only assume that Mr Macphee has based this on those press reports and the later references to them in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, because Mr Hollis told me that he did not communicate it to him directly; it never happened. What did happen was that a process was put in train by me with the secretary of my Department, Graham Evans, and the associate secretary, Roger Beale, where we had numerous meetings, discussions and detailed advice was given as to the best way of establishing the inquiry; whether it was going to be a single person inquiring into it or two or three people in a tribunal inquiring into it and, indeed, the class of person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, at one stage I can recall that a suggestion was made that it be the Auditor-General that conducted the inquiry. All of this was actively canvassed at the time of the totally unexpected resignation of Senator Richardson and my move from the portfolio. The matter was well in hand at that point, and I know that those senior officers from my Department, Roger Beale and Graham Evans, subsequently provided the same advice to Senator Cook, as the new Minister, as they had given to me, in a far more detailed and coordinated fashion; that is, that the flesh was filled in at that stage on the bones. But the facts are that the inquiry would have proceeded with exactly the same expedition if the unfortunate resignation of Senator Richardson had not occurred. That is a matter of fact that can be demonstrated. I intend, of course, to make those points to Mr Macphee when I speak to him later today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the report itself, I think that Mr Macphee has done a good job in setting in context the difficulties the CAA had in the past, the substantial losses that had been suffered&mdash;some $48m he correctly asserts&mdash;in in-house solutions to replacing our badly outdated air traffic control system around Australia. I welcome his comments in respect of the Cairns radar, where he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Review's opinion, the political and media attention given to the difficulties at Cairns and Coolangatta exaggerated the seriousness of the problems being experienced.</PARA>
<PARA>He has done a fundamentally good job on this report. His basic conclusion is essential to implement&mdash;but of course, I say that in the context of not being the Minister responsible now. In terms of the processes that were set in train, by myself in consultation with the two senior officers I have mentioned from my Department, the fundamental recommendation&mdash;and there really is only one&mdash;that this be done, did not surprise me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has moved to address some of the emerging problems that have occurred with GBEs generally. The statement that will be made some time in the future by Mr Willis in respect of tighter accountability procedures with GBEs, but in particular, the major initiative that has been taken in respect of the purchasing&mdash;major contracts over $30m&mdash;of GBEs and Australian content, has also been adequately addressed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by making one other reference to the report. As distinct from the assertions of Senator MacGibbon, Mr Macphee has strongly endorsed the action that was taken by the Board and the senior management to adopt the TAAATS project. Senator Bishop is sitting there shaking her head again. Mr Macphee has done that not only in precise terms, but in great detail. He strongly endorses it. He says that it was, in fact, the correct process. In his covering letter to the Minister, he says:</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Correct. But what he did say&mdash;and Senator Bishop should refer to it&mdash;is this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fundamental decision to abandon the piecemeal, costly and failed process that the CAA had engaged in and to go to the system of a national air traffic control system was soundly based&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and was, in fact, the correct decision. On page 73 he also says this in respect to what happens in the future&mdash;and I make this point because I think it should be pointed out in respect of what has been said in here:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such changes are peripheral to the Review, but part of the atmospherics. There had to be changes of culture reflected in function and staff size. The Board and its then chairman, Mr Smith, deserve credit for beginning the transformation. Whether management might have handled it more sensitively might be fruitfully debated elsewhere. What is clear is that there remains a substantial challenge for the new Chairman, Mr Butcher, and senior management to win the support of the remaining staff and their unions in order to develop a new work ethos. There is certainly no point in re-opening old wounds and wishing for the good old days.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason I want to finish on that point is this: the CAA has done a great deal of work in the last few years that has been greatly welcomed and supported by the aviation industry. The people who are senior in that industry have no wish to go back to the good old days referred to by Senator MacGibbon&mdash;and that is the reason I make the point&mdash;the good old days, when it was a regulator, in which the cost of the regulation was totally divorced from the operation itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think anyone wants to return to that. A great deal of positive structural change has occurred and is continuing to occur with the civil aviation organisation. That has been of enormous benefit to the aviation industry. There were almost $100m in savings to the industry just last year. That reform will continue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether the address we heard from Senator Collins was an apology for senior officers of the CAA or an apology for himself. But in both cases it was wholly and utterly short of the mark. The adverse findings against senior officers in the CAA, which are contained in this report on the Thomson radar contract, require their immediate dismissal from the Authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is more important of course is that we accept Mr Macphee's recommendation that the tender process for the radar contract be reopened. Everything in this report vindicates my concerns when I first raised this issue at the beginning of this year. The very first question about this matter in this Parliament to Senator Collins concerned changes to the evaluation personnel. From recollection, I was assured that there were no changes to the evaluation personnel. Yet the changes are evidenced in this report, and follow the 18 December 1991 meeting of the board when things started to be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately it goes further than that. It appears that senior officers of the CAA were not sufficiently competent to make appropriate decisions for the safety of the Australian travelling public. That is what this is all about&mdash;the safety of the travelling public. I am also very concerned about some of the findings that Mr Macphee made about what he described as the `management style' of two of the executives, Mr Baldwin and Dr Edwards. Not only did they demonstrate very little management but also they demonstrated no apparent style at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report details a paper trail of documents which included briefing material prepared months after its apparent date. There is also evidence that the critical board meeting which selected the Thomson system was called at two days' notice upon the advice of Mr Baldwin&mdash;two days' notice for the calling of a board meeting that was to make what Mr Macphee describes as the most fundamental decision that Authority would make!  Not only is this disturbing, but it is quite simply unacceptable that the directors and members of the board should have been expected to read their briefing papers while watching a slide presentation, and then reach a decision in time to catch the last plane out of Canberra. To characterise this as mere incompetence is extremely charitable. Mr Macphee has been extremely charitable to these two gentlemen. I think it really does go beyond incompetence. I will get on to the detailed evidence about that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Macphee's comment about that was very telling. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The advice to the Board by Mr Baldwin and Dr Edwards was fatally flawed. It was inadequately researched and tested. Hughes were not assessed fairly.</PARA>
<PARA>They are very disturbing words. The findings made against them should require their immediate dismissal from the Authority. Could I make this point also for the individuals concerned: I understand that similar matters are being canvassed in New Zealand and that a parliamentary committee of inquiry in that country will be examining this report closely. It is being extremely charitable to say that it is mere incompetence in two countries on either side of the Tasman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was found that Thomson's main competitor, Hughes, had been recommended as preferred contractor on 18 December 1991 but rejected, and that in the period after that information presented to the board of the CAA highlighted risks related to Hughes but not to Thomson. I think that is very important. I think I ought to go into some of that. On page 53 of the report Mr Macphee outlines the details of that meeting on 18 December. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was also recommended to the Board that Hughes be announced as the preferred contractor.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Macphee also noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chief Executive's comment attached to the Board paper stated that Mr Baldwin supported the recommendation, but requested that the Board note Executive Management's concerns regarding the risks associated with Hughes' proposal.</PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on through this report to show that what we had was an unfair treatment of the issue of risk. This is one of the matters that I raised in the Parliament, in the Estimates committee, and in the briefing that occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to go into the briefing but let us go to what Mr Macphee said about Mr Baldwin and the information that was provided. He said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is difficult to imagine how Mr Baldwin, as a Board member, could not have realised the arresting effect this proviso would have on the other directors. Executive Management and Mr Baldwin highlighted the risks associated with Hughes <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">despite the fact that the operational and technical evaluations had taken account of risk and Hughes had still been evaluated as the top bidder</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is set out in italics in the very large paragraph at the top of page 53. This was the issue that I raised when I provided Dr Edwards, and other members of the management team, with copies of the evaluation sheets showing that risk was a factor that the original evaluation teams considered. We were given some nonsense story about not understanding what the risk was all about. This report clearly shows that the comments I made were correct, that risk was double counted and, more importantly, that the risk was double counted in a fashion which was clearly prejudicial to Hughes. There have been many doubts expressed about the Thomson radar system. The Australian public can now have very little confidence left about the system. Certainly, to proceed with the contract after all the problems that have occurred in relation to performance and also the awarding of the tender would be very unsound and highly unsatisfactory. The only proper thing to do in the circumstances is to reopen the tender and, if necessary, award it to somebody else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is appropriate to look at some of the background to the awarding of that tender. For example, we previously canvassed in Parliament, either in the chamber or elsewhere, issues about where the Hughes system was working elsewhere in the world. Korea was one of those. A delegation was sent to Korea. However, page 83 of the report is damning of the preparation that was undertaken prior to that team going to Korea and damning of the time and opportunity it had. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the lack of full and fair information many Board members gravely under-estimated the ATC system in Korea and consequently the abilities of Hughes.</PARA>
<PARA>I think Senator Collins made a similar mistake in some of his statements in this chamber.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of the slide on the Board was profound. In the minds of most directors, the risks associated with Thomson had vanished. Indeed, while various risks had been highlighted regarding the Thomson bid, the directors all remembered the emphasis which Mr Baldwin and Dr Edwards had placed upon the risk with Hughes.</PARA>
<PARA>This whole process has been extremely painful for people on both sides of the chamber who have entered into this in good faith. I note that Senator Schacht is nodding his head in agreement. Some people on this side of the chamber have been subjected to wholly unfair, unsatisfactory and very painful treatment both in this chamber and elsewhere. I think it is appropriate to note the comments that were made by Mr Macphee in saying that the people who were involved in getting this reviewed deserve the thanks of the Australian public.

I remind Senator MacGibbon that at the time of Mr Macphee's appointment and the terms of reference being announced he did make some disparaging remarks about the terms of reference being too narrow. I think it has been shown to all of us that the terms of reference and the review headed by Mr Macphee were more than adequate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other reason I have become interested over the last couple of years in CAA matters is that the board and the senior management showed absolutely no interest in developing Australian industry in civil aviation matters. When I raised it with board members and senior management in the previous couple of years there was only one answer: `We are here to run a commercially effective operation; our concern is not about developing Australian industry'. If every public sector department, every industry in Australia, took that attitude we would not get any development at all. So I became concerned about the view of management at the senior level of the CAA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of very clear things which emerge from this report. The first is that the process must be reopened in which Thomson and Hughes go back to being the two major contenders and that a proper process of tendering takes place. The second thing that must take place is that Mr Baldwin and Mr Edwards, if as a result of this report they have not resigned their positions before midnight tonight, must be sacked by the board. They can in no conscionable way continue to be the two senior full time executives of the Civil Aviation Authority. This passage from the report has been quoted here before by other honourable senators, but on page 90 the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The advice of the Board by Mr Baldwin and Dr Edwards was fatally flawed. It was inadequately researched and tested. Hughes were not assessed fairly.</PARA>
<PARA>Those two sentences mean that those officers have to go. They should have the honour to resign today or by midnight tonight. If not, the board should meet tomorrow and sack them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have something to say about the board. We have read about the board making its decision in March of this year. It is quite clear that there are two board members who, in my view, have maintained some honour&mdash;Mr Ayres and Mr Mant. In my view, all the rest should resign. I do not believe that the present Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the board can sustain their positions, particularly when we hear about the board meeting in March of this year. When the board meeting took place two members were not present&mdash;although, according to Senator Collins, they did put in proxy votes&mdash;to make the decision to let the biggest commercial contract in its history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it would be only reasonable to ensure that all board members were present. I believe that the Chairman of the board should not have allowed that meeting to proceed. Therefore, in view of the findings of this report, Mr Butcher, as Chairman, should also resign. Though Senator Cook has put before the board a course of action to respond to the report, I hope that it does not come to the situation where the Government has to take direct action and ask members of the board to resign or have them sacked. I hope that they do the honourable thing and resign in the next few days. Mr Butcher is also Chairman of the National Rail Corporation. In view of the findings about the operation of the board, he should review his position as Chairman of the National Rail Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the brief time available&mdash;I know that the Whips want to keep this debate as brief as possible&mdash;I will address the area of industry policy, which is dealt with on page 78 of the report. In part, the review says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It therefore followed that the Board felt that any consortium member providing services would be a minor consortium member. Further, the Review believes the Board did not explore with Australian industry what it could offer in a TAAATS consortium. TAAATS was, in their minds, an exercise in purchasing goods, and Australian companies did not make RDP or FDP systems. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our view, the Australian companies concerned have justification for being critical of the CAA for adopting this approach, especially as it does not accord with the policy of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>At this stage, I give particular mention to one of the heroes in this sorry saga. There are a few heroes. It is very easy for us in Parliament to be heroes and raise issues in debate because we have privilege protection. But I congratulate Bev Clarke, a senior officer of DITAC, who made a number of remarks publicly criticising this process and got her fingers rapped very strongly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While considering this issue of industry policy in an Estimates committee hearing, I asked Mr Baldwin what the CAA was doing about industry policy and what the views of Senator Button were about the CAA's industry policy. As bold as brass, under privilege and oath, Mr Baldwin said, `I've had a discussion with Senator Button. He is more than happy with the industry policy of the CAA'. The next day I took the opportunity to speak to Senator Button about that comment. I said, `Are you happy with Mr Baldwin's view of industry policy in the CAA?', and he said, `Absolutely not; I have never given him that impression'. That is another example where Mr Baldwin, in my view, is very liberal with the truth of what others say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that same Estimates hearing I asked whether Mr Baldwin and Dr Edwards were being indemnified by the CAA board for writs that they were personally taking out against journalists. Out came a long saga about a number of writs being taken against particular journalists, guaranteed to a limited amount by the CAA board. In my view, they were completely unnecessary. The board was again derelict in allowing an unlimited indemnity for these writs to be issued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to a consideration of the industry policy. I believe that the CAA, as a public function, should have a properly developed industry policy. In our region, the opportunities to export our technology in aviation, radar and air traffic control are immense. Only three months ago, AWA Australia, a fully owned Australian company, won a $20m contract internationally in China against opposition from other companies to provide air traffic control equipment. It had the opportunity not only to bid but also to show that its technology, Australian developed, was better than any in the world. With the success of that contract, there is now the further opportunity for it to get another contract of $80m in China. That all means exports from Australia and extra jobs in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the CAA has been asked to help in that area in the past there has not been a whisker of help. The CAA was asked to provide a letter to AWA to help it in its bid with the Chinese. A more sparse letter of endorsement one would never hope to see. I believe it is something that the AWA would not be willing to use in China because, reading between the lines, it basically says that the CAA does not care about Australian exports from Australian companies in civil aviation equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is typical of the attitude of the present senior management and board of the CAA. I believe that, if nothing else, we should change the board and its senior management. Getting some decent Australians, who are committed to Australian exports, to manage this operation would be an improvement on hiring doubtful people from New Zealand who do not seem to have any idea about developing Australian industry. I understand that New Zealand had similar views about these people not developing the industry in New Zealand when they ran the New Zealand system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this is a seminal report on the way in which we have to look at the running of government business enterprises. There is a conundrum on this issue. How does one balance a commercial board vis-a-vis ministerial responsibility? That debate will continue to go backwards and forwards. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Lewis has the perfect answer, I want to hear it. There is no perfect answer about balancing those two questions. If a Minister were put in charge of a commercial operation, we would all be screaming that he was playing the commercial game and interfering in commercial activities. There would then be arguments about whether he showed influence and so on. If he or she is removed from it completely and the board goes mad and does stupid things, we would all come back in here screaming, `Sack the Minister'. It is an absolute conundrum about how we deal with this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This problem occurred in South Australia. The Act said that the State Bank should be at arm's length from government. In my view, the Premier unfortunately took that point too literally. He let the board go off on its own for far too long. But when it all collapsed the board did not take the rap; the Premier took the rap and had to pay the political penalty, even though the Act said that he could not interfere in the day-to-day management of the bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this is a conundrum. It is a debate that we will always have. There is no perfect solution to it.

This report has restored my faith in parliamentary committees as it should restore the faith of the public in them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht has already told us of his involvement in this matter and Senator Collins has told us that he is starting to put an inquiry into place. There were even kind words from Senator MacGibbon about Senator Cook and the way that Senator Cook acted with efficiency and integrity in speedily hastening the production of this report. The report says that if it had not been for the persistence and the diligent inquiries of Senator MacGibbon and the Public Works Committee, particularly the Chairman, Mr Hollis, there is some doubt whether this committee process, the report that we have before us today and the system that was trying to be pushed through would have ever come to light. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a feeling that Senator Collins, the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support at the time, was in some ways probably snowed. I had the impression that I was being snowed from the day we first met Dr Edwards, in particular, and Mr Baldwin. I had the feeling&mdash;I am sure the other members of the Committee also did because we spoke about it afterwards&mdash;that we were being absolutely snowed. To some extent, the Minister at the time may have been, because his opinion was that the Hughes system was the better system. But he took advice and changed his mind. I pay tribute to Senator MacGibbon. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator MacGibbon has won respect for his perseverance on other issues and was no less persistent on this. His call for a review of the decision was made with the public interest in mind, and he shrugged off some pressures to silence him.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I give credit to Mr Hollis in the other place, the Chairman of our Public Works Committee. It is a pity that he was not as strong on the decision about the York Park building which will be brought up this afternoon and which I will mention later. In this case he stuck to his guns even though it does say in the report&mdash;and the Minister has denied it&mdash;that he was savaged by Senator Collins on more than one occasion. I know that for a fact. The line in this report which sums it all up is:</PARA>

It is all right for Senator Collins and Senator Schacht to come in and claim some credit for what has happened, but Senator Collins should do the honourable thing and resign from the Ministry over this. I say that in all seriousness, because for many a day in this Parliament Senator MacGibbon and Senator Lewis tried to indicate to Senator Collins that there was something wrong. All they got for their efforts was personal abuse all the time. Senator Collins went out of his way to defend the CAA board and these officers against what everybody knew and what we were trying to elucidate at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During a hearing of Estimates Committee C on 31 March 1992 at about 4 o'clock in the morning that Committee was trying to show Senator Collins just what was happening. I was working with a series of questions that Senator Lewis had made available to me, because he had been unable to get to that Committee. At all times we were thwarted by the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If senators have a look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of that day, they will see that Senator Collins in his usual bumptious style did his best to put us off the track. I say, with some regret, that he was assisted by the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Crowley, in trying to get the matter over and done with. Admittedly, it was 4 o'clock in the morning. Honourable senators may remember that Senator Aulich came in at the end and put his bid in, in a screaming match to try to get the Committee to stop asking questions about this incident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refresh the Senate's memory by quoting a few paragraphs from that Senate Estimates Committee hearing. Senator Bishop was asking about Mr Baldwin, his reputation and his background, and this is what Senator Collins said to Senator Bishop:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Excuse me, Madam Chairman. I am heartedly sick of these personal inquisitions by Senator Bishop. This constant pursuit by Senator Bishop, in Supplementary Estimates particularly, of people rather than problems has been demonstrated before. . . I will answer this question. I will take the responsibility&mdash;as I have said in the Senate before, properly take the responsibility&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Are you listening to that, Senator Collins? You said you would take the responsibility. Why do you not resign and take the responsibility? You said you would do it in a flourish of supposed style, as you are pretty good at doing. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will take the responsibility . . . for whatever advice was given in terms of the policy directions. . . </PARA>
<PARA>He then proceeded to criticise Senator Bishop. Senator Bishop was inquiring into Mr Baldwin and his worth for this job. Senator Bishop went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minister, this is not your personal fiefdom&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>after Senator Collins had gone off at one of his tangents&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is Government money and taxpayers' money that is being expended. Why will you not let Mr Baldwin give to us his background in order that he may assure the Committee as to what qualifications he had to exclude Australian consortiums?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins said that it was not relevant, Senator Bishop said it was, and Senator Collins said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not relevant to Supplementary Estimates. In fact, the CAA, having no call on the Supplementary Estimates at all, is not even required to be here.</PARA>
<PARA>Senators were trying to point out back in March what we hear today in this report and Senator Collins was trying to stymie the process. Senator Collins went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In deference to requests from senators&mdash;and I have always done this&mdash;I am happy to have them&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the CAA&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">here, but not for the pursuit of some personal inquisition that Senator Bishop specialises in. What I will do is make. . . CV available. . . </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to criticise Senator Bishop for inquiring into this man's background. Later on he continued with that sort of material, trying to stop this Estimates Committee getting the information that was required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is probably instructive to have a look at some other extracts. At that Committee hearing I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can I just inquire whether the recommendation from the executive to the board gave full details to the board of all aspects of the Hughes contract?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Baldwin's answer was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsequent to 18 December when IBM fell out, on two occasions we had two meetings with the board on this issue. They were given the full details of both companies in a very fair and correct way.</PARA>
<PARA>According to Mr Macphee, that has been shown to be quite incorrect. Mr Baldwin went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, I want to assure you, Madam Chairman, and the rest of your Committee that the board was given all the information fairly and very justly on both companies in some considerable detail.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in the hearing Senator Collins said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can I answer this question in the general sense? Senator Lewis in Question Time in the Senate the other day asked a question relating to the process which Senator Macdonald is now asking questions about, and asserted&mdash;and I described this as being rubbish; and it was&mdash;that this particular process put the CAA in a `weak position'. In fact it is as good a process for getting the maximum benefit to the travelling public as I have seen, in a sense. . .</PARA>
<PARA>One of the recommendations from Mr Macphee says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This decision on 2 October 1991 was within the authority of the CAA, but caused a significant loss of negotiating leverage and was, therefore, unsound.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the same decision as the one Senator Collins was referring to when we said it would put them in a weak position, and he said that was rubbish. This is the Minister who, at the time, was protecting the board and these people and continued to do so. I will again quote from Mr Macphee's report which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Board was not given the proper and adequate information on which to choose a preferred contractor at any of the meetings of 18 December, 1991, 7 March, 1992 or 13 March, 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators might note that 7 March and 13 March are just a few days before that Senate Estimates Committee hearing when Mr Baldwin assured us that they had been given all of the correct information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will read a couple more extracts from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> transcript of the Estimates Committee hearing which I think are instructive. Senator Collins said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I just have to make a short statement in defence of the board and the idea that the board of the CAA is a bunch of mugs that have wandered in off the street and that simply accepts, unquestioningly, whatever the management of the CAA hands it.</PARA>
<PARA>He is saying that they are not a bunch of mugs who just accept unquestioningly what the management of the CAA hands them and Mr Macphee has shown that that is exactly what did happen. The CAA management handed them this advice and recommendation which was just accepted by that board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go on a little further in that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Senator Collins then went into a defence of the board and with one of his usual flourishes said, `I'll give you a list and show you what great people they are'. I said to him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not for a moment doubting the expertise, the competence or the honesty of the board. I just want to know that the board was given the full facts.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, that assurance has been given, I think, three times now by Mr Baldwin. I simply confirm that, but also say that the CAA board is not only a competent but an aggressive board.</PARA>
<PARA>My time is running out; my Whip is indicating to me that time is short and I accept that. I do not want to interfere with the running of this chamber.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I again call on Senator Collins to do the right thing and resign. I join with my colleagues in particularly noting the significant steps that Senator MacGibbon took in this whole procedure and identified the problems right from the start.

Firstly, I have repeatedly raised in this Parliament the question of government business enterprises and the contracting arrangements that they enter into. Over a period of many years, certain safety precautions have been put into place when governments enter into contracts in order to make sure that things such as Senator Schacht suggested&mdash;that people would say that Ministers were rorting the system&mdash;would not happen. When this Government went down the government business enterprise path&mdash;not a genuine privatisation&mdash;it forgot about those safety precautions. I have warned the Government repeatedly; I still warn it, and I am glad to hear that Senator Schacht says it is a matter which the Government must address. The Government certainly must address it, and privatisation is a matter which our Ministers will have to address as we go down the path of privatisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I pose the question: is the Civil Aviation Authority the sort of body that ought to be privatised anyway? It was privatised for one reason, and that was that the Government needed to fix up the salary structure. It could not do that under government arrangements because of the salaries that are paid at government level, so it privatised the authority, fixed up the salary level and was able to employ a chairman at some fabulous salary. He adopted a business approach to this and said, `Let's cut through all the red tape and let's forget about governments and responsibility to the people of Australia and all the rest of it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Minister goes to the Melbourne airport he should walk around the car park and look at the car parking places that the Civil Aviation Authority people have given themselves.

Is that the sort of body that ought to be set into a government business enterprise?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, I want to mention the abuse by Senator Collins. He ought to be ashamed of himself. He ought to publicly apologise to Senator MacGibbon for what he kept saying to him. I remember that on one occasion I stood up and said, `This smells'. I have a good lawyer's nose and I said, `I don't know a great deal about this, but this smells'. I do not care for any of these parties, I do not represent any of these parties, yet Senator Collins interjected by saying something which implied that in some way or other I was acting as a lobbyist for one of the tenderers, which was quite outrageous at the time. There was nothing I could do about it, except make some personal explanation in the Senate, but it is too late when we get that sort of rough interjection. I say to Senator Collins that there are a number of people in this place that he ought to apologise to, in particular, starting with Senator MacGibbon.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee found that the quality and content of physical education, Australia-wide, has declined as a result of such things as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*the "crowded curriculum" in both primary and secondary schools;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*the inclusion of physical education under the broad umbrella of health education;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*a lack of a coherent physical education policy in any State or Territory;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*the devolution of decision making to local school councils;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*a lack of defined and agreed outcomes for physical education courses compared to other areas of the curriculum;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*a reduction in the number of specialist physical education teachers, particularly in primary schools, and the limited preparation of generalist teachers for physical education;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*a lack of State and Territory education departmental support for teachers supervising physical education;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*a confusion between what is physical education, what is sport education and what is school sport; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*the use of AUSSIE SPORT and associated sporting programs to justify the withdrawal of physical education from schools.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no dispute about the importance of physical education (and school sport as a subset of that), yet there is a serious problem with its delivery. Physical education is an important part of the curriculum because it develops physical skills and contributes to the maintenance of health, fitness and prevention of sickness not only in childhood, but throughout life. Physical education is an educational end in itself, and when properly supervised and taught, can also lead to increased performance in other areas of the curriculum. The emergence of future elite athletes also depends on the provision of quality physical education in schools today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is interesting to note that despite the obvious link between physical education and health, the Committee did not receive any submissions from departments of health. (It did receive one submission from the Aboriginal Medical Service in Western Australia)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the major concerns highlighted by this report is the development of the proposed national education curriculum. The Committee concluded that the proposed national education curriculum which currently incorporates physical education under Strand 1 of the National Health Learning Area Statement does not adequately reflect the importance of physical education. THE COMMITTEE HAS RECOMMENDED THAT THIS AREA OF THE NATIONAL EDUCATION CURRICULUM BE RETITLED THE NATIONAL EDUCATION STATEMENT ON HEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND THAT PE BE IDENTIFIED AS A SEPARATE STRAND WITHIN THIS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was told of widespread community concern about the amount of time and quality of physical education and school sport being offered, especially to our primary school children. THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHYSICAL SKILLS AND HABITS OF FITNESS MUST BE ESTABLISHED AT PRIMARY SCHOOL, and all the evidence before the Committee suggests that this is just not happening. AUSSIE SPORT has been widely accepted throughout the community and in schools, but should complement, not replace, comprehensive and structured physical education programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, the Committee found that Junior Sports Development Officers, who are funded by various sporting associations, can play a very positive role by going into schools and teaching both students and teachers specific sport skills and rules. However, there must be a consistent approach to the role played by these officers. In particular, A UNIFORM CODE OF BEHAVIOUR NEEDS TO BE DEVELOPED FOR THE ROLE OF ALL COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN SCHOOL SPORT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">State and Territory departments of education are responsible for providing all aspects of school based physical education, and the Commonwealth is expected to play a leading role in the development of curriculum and policy. However, the Committee heard in almost every capital city that Departments of sport and recreation, both State and Federal, and community sporting organisations are filling the "physical education gap" left by State and Territory departments of education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">POSITIVE AND COOPERATIVE LINKS BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION, DEPARTMENTS OF SPORT AND RECREATION, SPORTING ASSOCIATIONS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES CAN DELIVER QUALITY SPORT EDUCATION AND SCHOOL SPORT, AND THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES THESE LINKS SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED. However, the Committee does not believe that the community should be asked to pick up the pieces left by departments of education, THEREFORE WE HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT THE COMMONWEALTH MONITOR STATE AND TERRITORY RESOURCE ALLOCATIONS FOR PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND GIVE CONSIDERATION TO SPECIFYING A PERCENTAGE OF ITS GRANTS FOR EDUCATION EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE PROVISION OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION IF STATES AND TERRITORIES DO NOT MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS IN THIS AREA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PHYSICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS AT PRIMARY SCHOOLS MUST BE TAUGHT BY TEACHERS WITH APPROPRIATE PHYSICAL EDUCATION SKILLS, however, the Committee found that suitably qualified physical education teachers are not being employed to teach physical education and school sport. There is also evidence to suggest that many teacher training programs are not adequately preparing either generalist teachers or specialist physical education teachers to teach physical education. THE PROVISION OF STRUCTURED AND COMPREHENSIVE PHYSICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS SHOULD INVOLVE PHYSICAL EDUCATION TEACHERS WHO ARE ABLY SUPPORTED BY THEIR SCHOOL COMMUNITY AND DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. Unfortunately in this regard, States and Territory departments of education have wound down or abolished their PE support branches.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps the most alarming information to be put before the Committee is that children's physical skill levels are poor and declining, children are less fit, more obese, and children's participation in physical education and school sport is declining, especially amongst teenage girls.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE COMMITTEE FOUND THAT ACCESS AND EQUITY ISSUES NEED TO BE BETTER ADDRESSED IN FUTURE PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SCHOOL SPORT POLICIES. Not only do girls require greater opportunities, but so too do Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, children of non-English speaking backgrounds, and children with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the report, THE COMMITTEE DRAWS ATTENTION TO THE NEED FOR MORE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE RESEARCH TO BE UNDERTAKEN into the levels of fitness and physical skill levels of our children and the participation of girls and boys in, both in and out of school, physical activities. As well, MORE WORK IS REQUIRED IN DEVELOPING AND PROMOTING AGREED AND DEFINED OUTCOMES FROM PHYSICAL EDUCATION COURSES.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Committee believes that this report is very timely and that the 40 recommendations it has made provide a realistic and positive strategy which will enable PE to resume its rightful place in the education curriculum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">  STATEMENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On behalf of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade I have pleasure in presenting the Committee's Report on the Implications of United States Policies for Australia together with the transcript of evidence. It provides, I believe, a very timely assessment of the impact that the election of a new President and a very substantial turnover in representatives in the United States Congress, is likely to have on Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry itself has been conducted in a very short time frame. The Senate referred the matter to the Committee on 18 September. Altogether 31 submissions were received. Public hearings were held in the run-up to the U.S. elections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evidence canvassed issues of major importance to Australia, both with regard to the policy debates and developments in the United States on economic matters and on the question of security in the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In tabling the Report, I would like to draw attention to the key conclusions in the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, although there is a widespread expectation of a considerable element of continuity in American policy towards Australia, it would be foolish to underestimate the scope for important, and in many ways unpredictable, change that may confront both Australian and American policy makers during the term of the new President.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, the Committee considered that American interest in and understanding of Australia's interests and perspective, cannot be taken for granted, but has to be energetically fostered and encouraged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be a major task for Australia to ensure that the President and his advisers are as well informed of Australia's perspective on issues that matter to Australia as they can be.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">President Clinton will be the first in decades not to have had wartime links with the Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will also be a major task to ensure that other key players in the United States body politic, players such as Congress, professional and business groups, the media, organised labour, academics, think-tanks and other special interest groups are fully informed of the impact of United States actions on Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been tensions in the Australia-United States trade relationship. There is little expectation that these tensions will be resolved in the short term.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding some improvement in the recent past in the prospects of concluding the Uruguay Round of the GATT negotiations, Australia will need to maintain its efforts to improve its bilateral access to United States markets and limit the damage being caused to Australian producers by United States subsidies in third markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that there be greater emphasis in identifying and working with potential allies within the United States, to protect Australian trade interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the inquiry progressed it also became evident that a factor of utmost importance to Australia is the maintenance of sound United States economic and security links with the Asia Pacific region as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With one third of its trade already directed to the Asia-Pacific, the United States self-interest in maintaining these links could appear self-evident. However, there is a notable body of opinion that the continued positive relationship of the United States with major countries, especially China, cannot be taken for granted. In the case of Japan, notwithstanding the mutual commitment to the US-Japan security treaty, great care in managing continuing trade tensions will need to be exercised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Care must be taken to ensure that the consequences and impact of any unilateral United States trade measures on the countries of the region, and China and Japan in particular are fully evaluated. The wider regional effects that may flow from such actions must be fully understood. The Committee recommends that Australia play an active, positive role in ensuring that any dislocation of the current positive elements of the United States' security and economic relationships with Japan and China is avoided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee agreed with the views of expert witnesses that the APEC forum be developed further energetically. The Committee sees APEC both as a useful tool for further promoting the liberalisation of trade and as a means for reducing the risk of fracture in economic relationships across the Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee concluded that United States recent and planned defence force reductions in the Asia-Pacific region are not a cause for concern. The evidence put to the Committee that the United States capability is in no way being reduced by changing defence force numbers and forward basing arrangements, was persuasive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was, however, concerned that this may not be the view of all regional countries and concluded that Australia needs to be alert to opportunities for reducing regional concerns. One important consideration of course is the potential that such concerns could create for the competitive acquisition of arms by countries of the region. The Committee therefore urged that Australian policy makers review possible ways of drawing the United States into multilateral dialogue on security issues in the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee concluded that the change in Administration in the United States creates both opportunities and challenges for Australia. It is the Committee's hope that its Report will be of assistance in identifying the opportunities and provide pointers to areas of endeavour that will be of benefit to Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Devereux's tabling statement</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wednesday 16 December 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the four reports I have just tabled concludes an extremely busy year for the Committee and particularly in the period since August. The value of the projects in the nine reports that the Committee has tabled this week including five reports on Monday is approximately $750m.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should acknowledge that today there are two dissenting reports with the Committee being split on party political lines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the Badgerys Creek Airport proposal the Committee has recommended that the FAC's Stage 1 proposal not proceed but be replaced by an expanded Stage 1 proposal. The expanded Stage 1 proposal recommended by the Committee should include a 2900 m runway and not a 1800 m runway as proposed by the FAC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While agreeing that there is a need for a second major airport in the Sydney Basin and that Badgerys Creek is the most suitable location for such an airport the Committee has concluded that the FAC proposal places too much emphasis on passenger demand and does not take account of the potential growth of freight services to the Asia/Pacific region or the scope for industrial growth in the Western Region of Sydney. However the Committee believes that the $152m estimate provided by the FAC for a Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils type proposal is more realistic than the $42.46m estimate provided by the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have indicated the Committee believes that the initial development at Badgerys Creek should include a 2900 m runway with the minimum associated infrastructure necessary to allow for both domestic and international operations. This should include the provision of navigational and visual aids and an instrument landing system. Essentially after considering the evidence placed before it the Committee has concluded that the FAC's Stage 1 proposal is inadequate and unlikely to attract potential users.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recommending that an expanded Stage 1 proposal proceed the Committee has also recommended that the FAC should seek additional Commonwealth funding however should the Government be unwilling to provide the necessary additional funding a consortium including Federal and State Government bodies, local government&mdash;through the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils and other interested parties should be formed to develop and operate Badgerys Creek Airport through private funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's nineteenth report relates to the construction of a new international terminal complex at Brisbane Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The out-turn cost of the proposed work is $272m. The Committee has recommended that the work should proceed as planned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be remembered that the Committee, and indeed the Parliament had already approved the preparation of the proposed site, some two kilometres from the new domestic terminal, in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In arriving at its recommendation that construction should proceed, the Committee examined a number of important matters against the background of the Government's recently announced aviation policy reforms. The siting of the new terminal, the capacity of the existing domestic terminal to handle international flights, two competing terminals and the views of the aviation industry were all examined by the Committee. In fact the Committee considered the various options at great length including the expansion of the existing domestic terminal and a stand alone international terminal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The terminal design concept has a three-level configuration of 53,000 square metres and will provide seven aerobridge gates, four stand-off positions, four baggage reclaim units and three check-in islands. The main body of the proposed building will be designed to process 1500 passengers per hour, although the initial capacity will be 1065 passengers per hour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Airports Corporation assured the Committee that additional aerobridge positions could be added quickly to cater for any increases in demand without disrupting the activity of the terminal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal for the construction of the York Park Offices for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on a site in Barton ACT is one that has aroused considerable controversy&mdash;indeed the Opposition members on the Committee have dissented from the Committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However the Committee is satisfied that on the evidence presented to it that the York Park proposal appears to be the most economical of the proposals considered for providing alternative accommodation for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee concluded that the Administrative Building requires extensive refurbishing to meet current standards for Commonwealth Public Service office accommodation particularly in the areas of fire safety, building services and occupational health and safety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the York Park site the Committee believes that it is appropriate for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which is a key policy department to be located close to Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has also recommended that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continue consultations on a regular basis with staff and staff associations during the design development and construction of the York Park proposal and in particular in relation to the provision of child care facilities. The Committee has recommended that the York Park project proceed at an estimated cost of $186.832m at April 1992 prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final report I have tabled relates to the relocation of the Australian Hydrographic Office to Wollongong at an estimated cost of $12.5m.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is also a project that has aroused some controversy and I acknowledge that the Opposition members have dissented from the Committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Hydrographic Office is currently located in unsatisfactory accommodation in Walker Street North Sydney and there was general agreement, that the Australian Hydrographic Office requires new accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the controversy surrounds the issue of loss of staff which may result from the transfer to Wollongong. The Department of Defence advised the Committee that the possible extent of staff losses will not be determined conclusively until all staff have exercised their election to relocate or not. Defence has acknowledged that the production rate of charts could slow for a period during and immediately following the move. However, Defence does not believe that safety of life at sea will be compromised. During the public hearing the Committee was told about the possible loss of key personnel. This argument is always presented when it is suggested that a government department or instrumentality move from a capital city to a decentralised location. It is an argument that I reject, some staff might leave, but then there is always a turnover of staff in any organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The work of the Australian Hydrographic Office could be carried out in almost any location with access to modern communication facilities. The Sydney site at Leichhardt, which the Committee inspected would have a motorway three storeys high cutting through one corner of the block and be directly under the approached flight path of Sydney Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having considered all the evidence the Committee is satisfied that the relocation of the Australian Hydrographic Office to Wollongong will not adversely affect its functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the reports to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some comments on two of those reports, the report on Badgerys Creek airport development, stage 1, and the report on the York Park offices at Barton. In particular, I wish to refer to the report relating to the proposed new Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade offices at Barton, which is just adjacent to the place we are in now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As one of the members of the Public Works Committee from this side of politics who signed the dissenting report accompanying the report that has been tabled, I would like to say that in this day and age when we have a million people out of work and an overseas debt in excess of $200,000m, I do not see how the Government can even contemplate building a Taj Mahal, as it is called in the report&mdash;I believe it is affectionately known among other people as a `Gareth Mahal'&mdash;at a cost of some $267m, taking into account the refurbishment of the old administration building. This is typical of the attitude that this Labor Party and this Labor Government have to money. There is no doubt that to fund this building the money will have to be borrowed, therefore increasing our overseas debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a quarter of a billion dollars. I do not know how some honourable senators can go back to their electorates and justify to the unemployed and poverty stricken people there the building of another new structure in Canberra along the lines of the Parliament House we are standing in now at a time of recession engineered by the Prime Minister. The funny thing about it all is that there is a great question over whether it is really needed. When this particular proposal was put to us, involving a cost of $187m just for the sumptuous new offices, one of the reasons put forward for it being needed was that the old building was too cramped. In fact, the Foreign Affairs and Trade Association pointed out in its submission to the Committee that the new building will be about the same size as the one the Department is leaving. I quote from the dissenting report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The York Park development is a bigger building than the existing Administrative Building yet provides only the same amount of working area.</PARA>
<PARA>That would lead one to suggest, of course, that the building itself was going to be an extravagant building&mdash;a bigger building but the same work area, at the cost of $187m!</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. Coming from the land, as I do, the last thing I would do in the middle of a drought if I had considerable debts would be to go and buy new machinery and put myself further into debt. At a time when, as I said earlier, we have over a million people out of work in this country, another million people who are underemployed, and an overseas debt of huge proportions that is growing every day by $1m, the Government will waste $187m on a sumptuous new structure for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Up until about three years ago, the preferred option was that the old administration building down the road be totally refurbished, including an annex, giving a greater floor space area than the new building would have, at a cost of something like $102m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But no, the Government made a decision&mdash;not recommended by anybody&mdash;to go ahead with this building. We already know that the office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) in the old building has been refurbished in the last couple of years at a cost of $240,000. That is just for the Minister's office. He has been in it a handful of times. I know it is used for visiting dignitaries and visiting ambassadors when they come to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reports says that the two floors&mdash;the fourth and fifth floors&mdash;of the communications centre were `not in need of refurbishment'. So we have a building which has&mdash;as proposed back in 1989&mdash;a new annexe which provided 240 extra car spaces and an extra 14,000 square metres. One could take one floor at a time in that new annexe and refurbish the building over a period of time. That was the original proposal. It was approved, no problem at all, and out of the blue, because the Government wished to build another edifice to its great 10 years in office, it is to waste $187m plus another $80m on top of that to refurbish the old building&mdash;a total of $267m&mdash;so it can put the employees of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in another building of the same size. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other report concerning the Badgerys Creek airport development, there is not enough money in the kitty to build a full length airstrip. The Government cannot afford the extra $40m or $50m. The Badgerys Creek airport has great ramifications for trade, freight and infrastructure in Sydney. There, the Government has to go for the cheap option&mdash;a 1,800 metre runway&mdash;because it does not have the money, yet in this case we can throw in $267m for a new Taj Mahal here in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay credit to the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils which lobbied very strongly to increase the length of the runway. In fact, the Committee has recommended that the initial development should provide a 2,900 metre runway as against the 1,800 metre runway that is proposed by the FAC. Again, we believe it is short-sighted. WESROC, as it is affectionately known, believes it is short-sighted. The new airport is in the best interests of the western Sydney region. We agreed with the proposals put forward by WESROC. It will promote growth in the area and expand the trade between Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. It is not only a freight runway but an alternative to Kingsford-Smith Airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the York Park Offices. Earlier today someone said what a great job the Public Works Committee did on the York Park Offices report. I am disappointed that two of my colleagues, who very vocally opposed the York Park building, were heavied and leant upon at the last minute to change their opinion. As of last night, one of the members of the Committee who was going to put in his own dissenting report was pressured into not doing so. </PARA>

The Chairman persuaded two members of the Committee who were going to present a majority report not to do so when it looked as if the Chairman would have to present a minority report. At the end of the day, the numbers came out the other way. I guess that is politics. The point I am trying to make is that most members of the Committee, at one point or another, had grave misgivings about this project&mdash;and we still do, as do members on the other side.

<PARA>Mr President, your very brief statement raises more questions than it answers. You will not be surprised to hear me say that. We have heard an intervention from Senator Collins who said that, as he understands it, the Speaker has lost the use of a third of his arm in this accident.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I heard you correctly&mdash;you seemed to read the statement very quickly&mdash;the accident occurred outside the parliamentary precinct. I might ask you whether that is correct. One of the questions I asked earlier today was: what was the basis of the claim? I presume from what you are saying that it was alleged that it was a claim as a result of faulty equipment provided by the Parliament. Why was faulty equipment being used by the Speaker outside the precincts of the Parliament? It seems a very strange situation. If the equipment has been provided by the Parliament, we obviously have an interest in it. We would very much like to know the nature of the fault in this equipment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rumour around the building&mdash;I do not know whether it is correct&mdash;is that it was an exercise bike. Mr President, are you saying that the exercise bikes in this building&mdash;I gather there are some in the gym&mdash;are faulty? If so, what was the fault? Another rumour going around the building is that the Speaker actually assembled this bike outside of the building. I would be interested to know whether that is so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Knowles said, it was not brought to the attention of the Joint House Committee. I would have thought that an accident which involved parliamentary equipment would have been brought to the attention of the Committee; it is astonishing that it was not. I know that we have to protect privacy in these matters, but we also have a responsibility to the public to be satisfied that public money is being correctly expended. In these astonishing circumstances of the head of the Department being paid damages, one would have thought that not only would it have been brought to the attention of the Committee but also it would have been stated in the report that it was an office-bearer of the Parliament and the head of the Department who was being paid these damages. But the report did not say that at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presumably, the answer will be one of privacy, but I do not think that is a satisfactory answer in this instance. One suspects, rather, there was an intention that it not become known that this occurred. Also, whilst I am hesitant to say it because of the privacy aspect, in this instance the answer is so unsatisfactory that people have to know what the injury was for which damages are being paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, what medical advice was given? What was the assessment?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to deal with the report relating to the relocation of the Australian Hydrographic Office to Wollongong, New South Wales. Having had a long association with the Illawarra region as my office is in Wollongong, naturally I am keen to see anything that will alleviate the high levels of unemployment in the Illawarra region. I have a concern, however, that Wollongong should not receive unfair treatment ahead of other areas with massive unemployment, for example, the Newcastle region, which I understood was one of the three location options put to the Minister when this whole proposition of moving from the present north Sydney premises was first raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three locations were Leichhardt in Sydney, Wollongong and Newcastle. According to the report, these were subjected to detailed financial evaluations using discounted cash flow techniques. The aim was to determine the financial attractiveness of the options by comparing receipts and expenditures with a view to generating a net cash flow over a 12-year period and which, when discounted back, would yield a discounted net present cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures I had seen from the Navy many months ago indicated that Newcastle was a far cheaper option than Wollongong. It was on that basis that I reluctantly said that it seemed to me to be unfair to give Wollongong this project ahead of Newcastle as both had suffered the same social and economic disasters and that a judgment had to be made based on where the greatest benefit would accrue for the least cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Strangely, this report does not further mention Newcastle at all. There is no indication of how it relates to the cost. All we find out is that, if the Department were to select Leichhardt over Wollongong, the Department would be $1.8m better off over 12 years. In other words, it is cheaper to move it to Sydney than to send it to Wollongong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From Sydney. In present net value terms, the report says that, having regard to the time value of money, the difference between Leichhardt and Wollongong, which is about $150,000 per year to the disadvantage of the Department, is considered to be marginal in the context of the benefits produced by the organisation. My concern is this: why is it up to the Department of Defence to provide funding for what is a good purpose, that is, to provide assistance in alleviating unemployment in Wollongong? Why is it not open to the Government through its other funding mechanisms to provide that sort of assistance if it needs it? Why does this report totally ignore the Newcastle option which, on the original figures, was far cheaper than the Wollongong option? All I want is for Wollongong to get this on its merits or else for it to be funded by a proper funding structure by way of specific assistance.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Statement on work of Committee during Budget Sitting 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overview</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During these sittings the Committee continued its non-partisan scrutiny of disallowable instruments of delegated legislation tabled in the Senate. In the course of the sittings the Committee scrutinised 978 such instruments, making a total of 1,754 scrutinised this year. This was a record, both for the sittings and for the calendar year. Less than one quarter of the instruments were in the Statutory Rules series, which are generally superior in drafting, access and presentation to other types of delegated legislation. This confirms a trend which has been evident for some years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As usual, the Committee scrutinised each one of these instruments to ensure compliance with its four principles which cover all aspects of personal rights and parliamentary propriety. Where the Committee had concerns with an instrument it wrote to the Minister responsible for the legislation. On a number of occasions it also required further information from Ministers after receiving an initial reply. It also gave 15 notices of motion of disallowance of individual instruments, in order to preserve its option to recommend this action to the Senate. However, the Committee is pleased to report that it received a good level of cooperation from Ministers, who undertook to amend 22 instruments to meet its concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concerns raised by the Committee are described below under each of the four principles which constitute its terms of reference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Principle (a)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is delegated legislation in accordance with the statute?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This principle is interpreted broadly by the Committee to cover all aspects of parliamentary propriety apart from whether a provision is more appropriate for parliamentary enactment, which is the Committee's fourth principle. Thus, the committee scrutinises every aspect of parliamentary propriety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee always checks the legal validity of instruments. Four instruments appeared to incorporate provisions of the laws of foreign countries as amended from time to time, which may not have been possible under the parent Act. Another instrument invalidly incorporated an external publication as in force from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is concerned that the quality of drafting and presentation of delegated legislation should not be inferior to that which is reflected in Acts. This standard is generally met by the Statutory Rules, drafted by the specialist Office of Legislative Drafting. However, the quality of instruments drafted by other agencies is often below this standard. The Committee questioned imprecise and unclear drafting, obsolete expressions and inaccuracies in references to other provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee ensures that all procedural formalities are complete, even if these are not legal requirements. Numbers of instruments were not accompanied by Explanatory Statements, others had no system of numbering or citation, and others were missing attachments. In one case an umbrella provision at the end of a set of amending regulations renumbered the entire Principal Regulations. This was a helpful initiative, but the Committee suggested, equally helpfully, that a reprint of the Principal Regulations was now required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee ensures that an instrument effects its intended purpose as expressed in the Explanatory Statement or as evident from its provisions. One instrument made new provisions without repealing the old. The Explanatory Statement for another advised that its purpose was to make two discretions subject to AAT review, but the instrument only included one discretion. The Explanatory Statement for another advised that its purpose was to increase fees by the cost of living for the last two years, but the increase in one fee was 87%, in another 50% and another 33%.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any power to delegate in delegated legislation should be as narrow, limited and specific as possible. Under one instrument a decision maker could delegate important powers to any person at all, while under another a major government business enterprise could delegate powers to any employee, no matter how junior. In another case, the Committee asked for an assurance that power to authorise medical treatment to certain persons without their consent could not be delegated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any legislative powers provided by delegated legislation should, where appropriate, be subject to tabling and possible disallowance. One set of amending regulations provided for determinations, declarations, directions, permits, signs, authorities, approvals and lists, some of which were certainly legislative but none of which were subject to disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee always questions a long period of retrospectivity, even if no person other than the Commonwealth is prejudiced. In one instrument members of a statutory authority were paid expenses with more than two years retrospectivity. Another instrument reflected an amendment of the parent Act which had been in operation for more than two years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Principle (b)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does delegated legislation trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no part of the work of the Committee more important than the protection of personal rights. The Committee interprets in the broadest possible way its mandate to ensure that delegated legislation does not breach personal rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee ensures that penalties, taxes and fees are neither harsh nor unreasonable. One instrument increased a penalty from $500 to $5000 with no explanation for the increase in the Explanatory Statement. Another instrument increased a levy with no explanation in the Explanatory Statement whether the purpose of the increase was to raise money, recover costs, deter use, or for some other reason. Another instrument was drafted in such a way that the amount, the imposition and the collection of a fine were all uncertain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government business enterprises should treat their customers fairly and equitably. One Explanatory Statement advised that the reason for a progressive increase in fees for applications for certain exemptions was to deter users. The Committee considered that this discouragement of a legislative right could have been a penalty. Another instrument required payment in advance except for regular users with a good record of payment on time. Another instrument provided that long established refunds for certain charges would no longer be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Statutory authorities should not impose harsh conditions on the public. One instrument provided that straying livestock and other animals could be impounded and destroyed with inadequate opportunity for their owners to claim them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee always questions prejudicial retrospectivity, even in the rare cases where it is legally valid. However, the Committee also questioned one instrument which corrected an oversight for public servants but which did not provide for retrospective operation. Here the Committee considered that the lack of retrospectivity was prejudicial.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee always protects personal privacy. One instrument provided for wide disclosures of personal information to law enforcement and security organisations with no indication that the agency had sought the views of the Privacy Commissioner. Another provided for the mandatory collection of detailed personal information about employees, which may not have been relevant to the stated purpose of its collection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Principle (c)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does delegated legislation make rights unduly dependent on administrative decisions which are not subject to independent review of their merits?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was concerned at a number of instruments which did not provide for merits review of decisions where it may have been appropriate to do so. These included decisions under discretions which conferred power to waive, vary or reduce fees; grant public service allowances; permit public gatherings; extend a time limit for applications; exempt a person from general prohibitions; enable costs to be taxed; grant benefits; pay interest at a particular rate; and control exports. In all these cases the Committee received from Ministers either an undertaking to amend the instrument to provide AAT review, or a satisfactory explanation of the provision. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee raised with Ministers other issues about merit review. In one case it asked for more information about the powers and functions of internal review panels and in others it asked for an assurance that AAT review provisions in the parent Act covered the regulations as well.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is more vigilant about merit review where the exercise of a discretion is not guided and controlled by objective criteria. It must be. One instrument included subjective criteria such as "the honesty of the applicant" and "the likely efficiency of the proprietor".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee scrutinises review provisions more closely where the discretion is wide and imprecise. One instrument set out detailed objective calculations for amounts which the Minister could determine. However, it then provided that an amount could be "such other amount as the Minister may determine".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Principle (d)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does delegated legislation contain matters more appropriate for parliamentary enactment?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee raises this principle less often than it raises other principles. However, it is a principle which goes to the heart of parliamentary propriety and as such complements the first principle of the Committee, that an instrument should be in accordance with the statute.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee raised the principle in respect of an instrument which transferred important powers to the government of Norfolk Island. These powers included the maintenance of law and order and the administration of justice; the whole of private law; corporate affairs; regulation of businesses and professions; child, family and social welfare; industry; and mining. The Committee noted that the transfer of similar powers to the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory had been largely implemented by Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also raised the principle when instruments modified, repealed and suspended the operation of Western Australian Acts in their application to Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. In addition, one of the modifications included a "Henry VIII" provision or, in other words, a provision under which delegated legislation may amend an Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The above instruments were all legally valid. However, the importance of their provisions was such that they may have been more appropriately included in a Bill and debated in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other Developments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to its core work of scrutinising delegated legislation, the Committee was active in other ways during the Budget sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee tabled two Reports during the sittings, the 92nd and 93rd Reports. The first was on Committee scrutiny of Public Service Determinations 1992/27 and 1992/46, where the Committee found that the Department of Industrial Relations, without proper consultation, effectively entrenched an injustice for some 30,000 former members of the Australian Public Service. The Determinations did not take into account strong recommendations by the Merit Protection and Review Agency that what it described as an "unfair and inequitable" situation should be addressed. Following intervention by the Committee and prompt and helpful cooperation from the Minister for Industrial Relations, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance the matter was resolved by a one line Budget appropriation. The second Report examined the 19 sets of regulations which implemented Australia's obligation to impose United Nations sanctions on Iraq, Kuwait, Libya and Yugoslavia. The Report concluded that it was appropriate to provide for sanctions by regulation rather than by Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Loosley also made a special statement on scrutiny of the Australian Postal Corporation Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1992 No.132, which presented problems about possible breaches of privacy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In suitable cases, the Committee invites departmental officials to attend meetings to brief it on matters of interest. Three officers of the Department of Transport and Communications attended to discuss the amendments of the Australian Postal Corporation Regulations; two officers of the Federal Office of Road Safety assisted with the Australian Design Rules; and the Public Service Commissioner, Mr Denis Ives, and another officer, briefed the Committee on a review of the Public Service Act and regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee made a submission to the inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into Commonwealth legislative drafting. The Committee also responded to the Administrative Review Council Report on rule making by Commonwealth agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A delegation from the Western Australian Joint Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation visited the Committee to discuss matters of mutual interest. Senator Mal Colston, a member and former Chairman of the Committee, chaired a four hour meeting with the Western Australians, which the Clerk of the Senate, the Legal Adviser, the secretary and others also attended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has asked the Legal Adviser to prepare a paper and brief it on the operations of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. It has also asked for a paper on the implications for delegated legislation of the use of rulings by the Commissioner of Taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 20 August 1992 the then Chair, Senator Patricia Giles, resigned from the Committee to represent the Australian Parliament at the United Nations General Assembly. The Committee benefited from her wise counsel during her two years as Chair and seven years as a member, during a period when the Committee had increasing responsibilities. Senator Loosley was then elected as Chairman.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the sittings the Committee secretary was absent on compassionate leave for six weeks and the Deputy Clerk, Anne Lynch, acted as secretary. It is a compliment to the Committee that the Deputy Clerk, a former secretary of the Committee, considered that its work was sufficiently important and challenging for an officer of her stature to undertake the duties of secretary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also records its appreciation for the work of its independent Legal Adviser, Emeritus Professor Douglas Whalan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is grateful for the support which it has received from all Senators during the past sittings.</PARA>

The channels can override `occasional' under the guise of saying, `Well, the program context is such that we must use it very regularly'. That is of concern to me. There was one particular program that I think the Minister would remember: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Phoenix</EMPHASIS>, on the ABC. It was a typical example of very offensive language being used every second word. There was a fair amount of concern in the community about that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to hear what has been stated in the chamber. I, of course, studied the terms developed by the ABT, in respect of their particular classification criteria, over a period. In so far as AO is concerned, there has been something of a deterioration in the terms used in that classification criterion. I am concerned about the interpretation that is made of the AO classification by one network in particular, and therefore a number of television stations throughout Australia. I am also concerned about the interpretation by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal of these particular guidelines.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the ABC and the SBS have special charter obligations to inform and educate as well as to entertain. From previous discussions I have had with Senator Alston, I know he agrees with those sentiments. While they are not exempt from observing community standards of taste and decency, they are required to produce programming that is innovative, that reflects the cultural diversity of the Australian community and which represents many points of view. For this reason, the ABC and SBS in particular&mdash;and I think it does a superb job of this, because of its multicultural broadcasting obligations&mdash;do find it difficult to apply uniform industry-wide sets of standards and more culturally diverse and innovative programming than they provide. And they do provide it, especially the SBS, which I have described on previous occasions as perhaps almost a niche service. It is a very specialised service that commercial television simply does not provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC and SBS are both protected by enabling legislation and by convention from direct interference in programming decisions. The editorial and programming independence of the national broadcasters, which are dependent on Government funding, as an important principle must be preserved. ABC and SBS programming does not rely to the same extent as the commercial media on films which portray high levels of violence. The SBS in particular has a longstanding policy&mdash;I know this as an assiduous watcher of SBS&mdash;of classifying some adult material for screening only after 9.30 or 10.30 p.m. In fact, as watchers of SBS would know, some of the excellent movies that the SBS broadcasts are broadcast even later than that. ABC and SBS programming does not rely to the same extent, as I have said, on that kind of blockbuster late release movie that commercial television does. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Page 5 of the codes of practice simply makes the point that M and MA material will be shown at certain times. It goes on to say that, whilst most adult themes may be dealt with, the degree of explicitness and the intensity of treatment will determine what can be accommodated in the M and MA classifications. The less explicit or less intense material will be included in the M classification and the more explicit and more intense material, especially violent material, will be included in the MA classification. That sounds to me very much like the OFLC to me. It means that the ABC will be able to show under these codes of practices unmodified, uncut MA violent films. That is what this code of practice does. It is unacceptable to the viewing public and unfair to the commercial television operators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to address the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 and the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 1992, which have been lumped together with the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992, the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1992 and the Data-Matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Amendment Bill 1992 for cognate debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Veterans rightly feel very angry that the Government has tried to rush these important pieces of legislation through both Houses of this Parliament. In the House of Representatives, the Government gagged debate on these Bills. As can be seen, we have had to agree to a time limit on this debate. The House of Representatives completed its consideration of these Bills shortly after midnight on 10 November this year. Is it any wonder that veterans have a total lack of trust in this Labor Government when such important legislation is dealt with in the dead of night and when debate is truncated?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) is a portfolio Bill implementing a number of Budget decisions and some minor non-Budget policy changes. The coalition is not opposing this Bill. We support the extension of Defence Service home loan provisions to allow use of a loan for repairs or modifications, as well as for the purpose of discharging an existing mortgage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also support the changes in relation to former prisoners of war. Spouses of ex-POWs will automatically qualify for the war widow's pension. While it should be noted that four in five widows of ex-POWs already qualify for the war widow's pension, surviving ex-POWs who are not TPI or EDA disability pensioners and their wives can draw comfort from the fact that there will not be a need to contest a war widow's claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also increases the level of pension payable to veterans and war widows. Pensions are to be increased on 4 February. The increase comprises two components; a one-off $2 a fortnight for standard rate pensions and the bringing forward of the anticipated March 1993 indexation increase. While the coalition does not oppose these increases, it is obvious to everybody, including veterans, exactly what this exercise is all about&mdash;something to do with an election measure. The so-called increase amounts to a grand total of $1 a week and will only further exacerbate the cynical light in which veterans and war widows now regard this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of the Senate to the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 1992. As is well known, the Government is proposing to significantly amend this Bill in the Committee of the Whole. The Opposition has its own second reading amendment which has been circulated to honourable senators. At the outset of my remarks on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill, I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Leave out all words after "That", substitute "in view of the Government's inadequate consultation, and the need for more time to assess its proposed amendments, consideration of the bill be postponed until the first sitting day in February 1993".</PARA>
<PARA>I would also add that if, by the first sitting day in February next year, there still has not been adequate consultation, the coalition will again take action to have consideration of the Bill deferred. If there has been consultation, but legal advice suggests that the Bill should be subject to even greater scrutiny, the coalition would then move to have the Bill again referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for this action is a damning indictment of this Government and its efforts to force through this Bill. It has attempted to change fundamental provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act without talking with the ex-service community. My colleague Senator Durack, a distinguished QC, has serious concerns which he will also try to address in the brief time available to him in this debate this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill was hurriedly put together in response to a High Court decision in Bushell v. Repatriation Commission handed down on 7 October 1992. The Government argued that the decision liberalised the basis on which an injury or disease could be said to be war or defence caused and this would lead to a blow-out in pension costs to veterans. The extent of this potential blow-out was put in alarming terms by the Government&mdash;between $1.2 billion and $2.2 billion over the next 10 years. Any responsible government would rightly be concerned at such implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When introducing the Bill the Minister stated that the intent of the Bill was only to restore pre-Bushell conditions. It was to address the High Court decision and no more. Yet, as more time was devoted to studying the Bill and the decision of the High Court, it emerged that the Government may have overreacted to the decision and that it may in fact have misinterpreted the High Court decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it was, the Bill concerned the coalition for a number of reasons. Firstly, we were alarmed at the speed with which fundamental provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act were being altered. Secondly, the Government failed to engage in any consultation with the ex-service community or the coalition and the Bill was presented as a fait accompli. Thirdly, we were concerned at whether or not this Bill would only achieve what the Government said it would achieve and that it would not unreasonably tighten the standard of proof provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We took the decision that the Bill should be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for further scrutiny. I stress that it was the coalition which initiated the referral of this Bill to the Senate Standing Committee. The Committee met on 23 November. Every one of the major ex-service organisations presented evidence. Senator Tate was at the Committee hearing and he will recall that witness after witness, flourishing legal opinions from QCs, senior counsel and practitioners before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, argued that the Government had misinterpreted the Bushell decision. They also argued that the effects of the proposed Bill went far beyond the Minister's assurances in his second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government was also heavily criticised for the lack of any consultation with the ex-service community on the changes contained in the Bill. The advice from the Solicitor-General, which the Government had relied on for its interpretation of the High Court decision and used as a justification for the Bill, was dismissed as fundamentally wrong by Justice Toose, an expert on the repatriation system and Chairman of the 1975 Independent Inquiry into the Repatriation System. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then saw an extraordinary turn of events. After the luncheon adjournment, Senator Tate, the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, revealed that in the face of the morning's evidence the Government would be deleting the sections of the Bill of most concern to the ex-service community. However, Senator Tate indicated that the Government still wanted to proceed with the remainder of the Bill as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition members on the Committee believed that no convincing case was made for the Bill being urgent. I strongly believe that more time is needed to assess the amended Bill. I know that this is the universal opinion of the ex-service organisations. The amendments and the new clauses to be moved on behalf of the Government were only circulated last Thursday evening. The new supplementary explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's view that the Bushell decision has significantly widened the scope of claims that would be successful was initially based on the opinions of the Solicitor-General, Senior Counsel and the Repatriation Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>It is then claimed that this view has recently been endorsed by the editors of veterans' matters in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Administrative Law Bulletin</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two important points need to be made here. As I have already said, Justice Toose&mdash;widely respected as he is on the repatriation system&mdash;said at the Committee hearing that the advice of the Solicitor-General was utterly wrong. Secondly, the comments in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Administrative Law Bulletin</EMPHASIS> were carried in the November edition, that is, before the Committee hearing. The editors therefore could not have been aware of the views that many experts presented to the Committee on the likely impact of the Bushell decision. The supplementary explanatory memorandum also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments now proposed will not eliminate all of the anticipated additional program expenditure. The extent to which the Bill meets its original objectives will, therefore, need to be monitored.</PARA>
<PARA>This additional expenditure has been bandied about by the Government as justification for the Bill, but what credibility does this assertion have? No satisfactory evidence has been produced for the Government's claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As indicated by Senator Tate at the Committee, and reflected in the amendments the Government circulated last week, the Government accepts that the original Bill was much stricter than the Minister indicated in his second reading speech. This admission was forced from the Government just by the sheer weight of the evidence presented to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government accepts the evidence in this regard, why does it not also accept the equally compelling arguments presented to the Committee that it has misinterpreted the Bushell decision? It has been selective in the views presented in the supplementary explanatory memorandum. The overwhelming evidence presented to the Committee was quite different from the largely discredited views contained in the supplementary explanatory memorandum. I think it says a great deal about the Government's approach to this legislation and it underscores the need for more time to assess the amendments to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of today's Bill is a classic case of how not to implement change. It was rushed into the Parliament; there was restricted debate in the House of Representatives in the dead of night; there was no consultation with the ex-service community; the Bill was savaged at a Senate standing committee; and now it is the Government's intention to fundamentally alter it in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the ex-service community feels angry and let down yet again by this Government and by its appalling management of this legislation. The credibility of the Government is on the line and it has been found to be wanting by the sheer weight of the impressive evidence presented to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed by the Government would appear to gut the Bill and, on this basis, one could be tempted to argue that they are unnecessary; yet the explanatory supplementary memorandum seeks to argue that the Bill largely meets the Government's aim, even if different methods are now being employed. The Government's aim to overturn the Bushell decision is a questionable one based on the evidence presented to the Senate Committee. I have already questioned a number of assertions contained in the supplementary explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of the short time that has been given to the coalition and to the ex-service community to assess the amendments and the supplementary explanatory memorandum, the coalition believes that this Bill must be deferred. The Opposition is acting in a proper and responsible manner in having the Bill's passage deferred on the basis of the second reading amendment which I moved earlier. The Government has handled this legislation extremely badly and it deserves the scorn which the ex-service community is heaping on it. I urge the Senate to support my amendment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Government has already amended the Bill again. We are left with a vastly different Bill. We now have to ask: why the haste? What really is left? Why the rush? Those in the veterans community may be happy with what is left, but they have not had the opportunity to look at it and to debate it. The two brief meetings they have had have not convinced them that this Bill is worth supporting. While we may not be thinking about other things, the veterans community is entitled to a peaceful Christmas and I look forward to its members having the opportunity to debate the Bill in February next year. This is the only problem I have with Senator Newman's amendment but I note that she is prepared to postpone again if the veterans community is still not happy. Therefore, the Democrats will not hesitate to support that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to miss another opportunity to congratulate the Senate committee system because, again, it has borne fruit. It was a most informative and interesting Committee hearing and I think all people went away feeling that something had been achieved. I will finish my very brief remarks on this Bill. I would have liked to concentrate on it for much longer, but we are aware of the time constraints. We should have done a lot more than look at legal technicalities. We need to look at this country's responsibility for and commitment to its war widows and veterans and what it says to them when legislation as important as this is rushed through&mdash;despite what is in it&mdash;and pushed on to them, and they have to adopt a defensive position. It does not say a lot for our understanding of their needs and our responsibilities to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the Auditor-General's report and its recommendation that, because of the sensitivities involved, a bipartisan select committee should look into this issue. While not disagreeing with this recommendation, the proximity to an election makes it impractical. I believe that the Commission would be better served and would gain more cooperation from the veterans community if the veterans' entitlements monitoring committee was reformed. Membership of that committee, under the chairmanship of Justice Toose, represented the Commission and major veterans bodies. The Democrats strongly recommend that this committee be reformed and asked to consider the effects of this legislation before us today as well as the concerns and recommendations addressed in the Auditor-General's report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Data-Matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Amendment Bill provides that various agencies can match data for the purposes of detecting incorrect payments of Commonwealth benefits or incorrect provision of Commonwealth services.

The Democrats have a long history of opposing the extension of tax file numbers and the accompanying data-matching program. We have been observing this area since the days of the Australia Card and can say with confidence that the Government has absolutely no credibility at all in this area. The assurances in relation to privacy issues are totally worthless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable senators that following the failure of the Australia Card in 1986, when the Government came up with the extended tax file number system, it repeatedly gave assurances that the TFN system would not be extended to other government departments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately some people believed it at that stage; the Democrats did not. Thus Mr Keating, the then Treasurer, told Parliament in 1988 that no other government or non-government agencies would have access to the tax file number registration system, nor would they be able to use an individual's tax file number for any registration system of their own. The public record is littered with these so-called assurances from the Government. Step by step, year by year, the Government has reneged on its specific promise to limit the use of tax file numbers to tax related matters. It has not only extended the TFN system but also it has introduced legislation permitting the matching of client information across a number of government departments. I repeat: the Government has absolutely no credibility in this area at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have never disputed the Government's claim of increased efficiency brought about by the TFN system, but we have simply continued to put the question: are we as a society prepared to pay the price of increasing intrusion upon our personal privacy in return for increased efficiency? Let us face it, the Privacy Act, introduced in an attempt to allay concerns about the extended TFN system, is not exactly a powerful piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the course of the Government's erosion of the privacy of Australians, the Democrats have consistently said that the savings the Government was claiming it would make with the extension of the system would not eventuate because all the evidence suggested that the fraud levels were quite insignificant. Where are those savings? In the social security area, the Government said it would save $290m in 1991-92; it actually saved about $25m.

This sort of figure made it very clear right from the start that the departments concerned could make savings through tightening up its other control measures&mdash;in other words, it did not really need the TFN system and the data-matching program, with its greater risks on privacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we said that for the sake of the relatively small savings that the Government will make, it will open up people to all sorts of invasions of their privacy. That is exactly what has happened. There has been a major expansion as to who can now deal with personal privacy information. Despite what the Government says, there are leaks everywhere. We only have to refer to the press. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the best efforts of the Privacy Commissioner, who operates under the hardship of a pretty toothless piece of legislation, we are constantly coming up against problems of people's privacy being infringed. Once you start a process of matching data across programs and across departments, regardless of what sorts of privacy measures you put in place, you start to lose control of that information. Basically, the Government took us down this track with no evidence that the extension of the TFN system and the data-matching program would result in any significantly greater savings than would have resulted in the tightening up of alternative control measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that background of broken promises, the Government wanted us to agree in this Bill to the repealing of a sunset clause in the data-matching legislation. This clause, which provided for an Act to be repealed on 22 January 1993, was originally inserted into the Act by the Democrats and the Opposition. Repealing the sunset clause would have allowed for the data-matching program to continue unreviewed on an indefinite basis. The Opposition moved amendments in the House of Representatives, the Government finally accepted those and we are more than happy to see them carried through here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three other Bills in the package. The Democrats have no major concerns with the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) or the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) and will not be moving amendments to those Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of positives in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) which will be of benefit to pensioners and beneficiaries, including: the bringing forward of the indexation of pensions and benefits; the increase in the rate of pensions, benefits and allowances; the extension of fringe benefits&mdash;that is something the Democrats have been calling for for quite some time; the increase in the mobility allowance; the relaxation in the definition of `independent young person'; and the increase in employment entry payments. I congratulate the Government on these measures, many of which are well overdue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we do have a number of problems with this Bill. I want to talk briefly about four areas which are of concern to the Democrats; firstly, the waiting period for migrants. Newly accepted residents who arrive in Australia after 1 January next year will have to wait 26 weeks before becoming eligible for the Jobsearch allowance, Newstart or sickness benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose I understand what the Government is trying to do here, but I really must place on the record my concerns about the fairness of this system. It seems to me that the issue should be who gets into the country on a permanent entry basis rather than their entitlements to Commonwealth assistance after they are accepted here. In effect, we are saying to these people, `Yes, you meet our criteria to enter Australia; yes, we are happy to welcome you as a permanent resident of our country; but, if you fall ill or if you lose your job within six months, do not expect any help'. It is not exactly a great welcome, and I ask the Minister whether the Government has any mechanisms in place to monitor these provisions to ensure that they do not cause undue hardship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next I would like to look briefly at voluntary work. Under this Bill, people aged 49 and under who are receiving Jobsearch allowance will be able to undertake voluntary work for up to 30 days in a calendar year without risking losing their payments. Previously JSA recipients between 18 and 49 could not formally undertake any voluntary work at all, while those under 18 were restricted to 20 days. All I can say to this measure is: at last! It is something that the Democrats have been pushing for for a long time, and why has it taken so long? I remind the Minister that I moved amendments to the social security legislation in June of last year to enable JSA recipients over 18 to undertake voluntary work. The Government would not support these amendments; nor would it support amendments to extend the number of days in a year that JSA recipients were allowed to do voluntary work. I believe our views on this matter have been thoroughly vindicated and I am only sorry that the Government did not see the light earlier, because not only have a number of unemployed people suffered because of this but a number of voluntary organisations and a number of organisations that rely very heavily on volunteers have also suffered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, even though the number of days has been raised, it is far from satisfactory. Thirty days a year may be all right if a person wants to do an odd day here or there but it is not any good for people who want to do a few solid stints of voluntary work as well as regular voluntary work. I refer in particular to people who may, for example, work with the Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers, who often go out for a week or two at a time, and it also has people involved on a regular weekly basis, particularly in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past when we have moved amendments in this area we have opted for 65 days in a year. I still believe that is reasonable. It is about 10 hours a week, a bit more than a day's work, and that still leaves, surely, more than enough time to look for work. I would think that at the moment one could probably read through the advertisements for employment options in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> in about half an hour, so surely it is reasonable to let people do an adequate amount of voluntary work. However, in the interests of trying to get the amendment through the Senate today, we are dropping that back to 50 days in a calendar year, or about eight hours in a week; in other words, one day. I hope that we will get the support of either the Opposition or the Government for this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last two measures I want to mention were examined by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and appear in its fourth report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Super&mdash;fiscal and social links</EMPHASIS>. My colleague Senator Kernot submitted a minority report on these particular provisions and her report recommends that both measures be rejected. These measures relate to the changes in the way unrealised capital gains on listed shares and allocated pensions will be treated. Madam Acting Deputy President, rather than try to go through all of this when we are pushed for time, I seek leave to have that minority report incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The minority report read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No 3) 1992</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">22. There are two areas in the Bill which should be modified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">A.Unrealised capital gains on listed shares</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">23. The Government is proposing to change the way in which pensioner investments in shares will be treated. At present, only the dividends paid to shareholders are taken into account for the purposes of the income test for social security payments, while the actual capital value of the shares is included in the assets test. Until now, the capital growth on listed shares has been disregarded. Amendments to the Social Security Act 1990 contained in the Bill provide for net unrealised capital gains on listed securities (other than bonds and debentures) to be taken into account under the income test. Losses accrued on listed shares (or similar investments) can be offset against the capital gain over the same assessment period, but cannot be carried forward. The Government says this brings listed shares into line with managed investments where capital growth on the investment is treated as income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">24. Several aspects of this proposed change are highly unsatisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It continues the questionable practice in the social security area (which is at odds with taxation practice) of treating an unrealised accretion to capital as income, rather than assessing it under the assets test.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It discriminates against shares as an investment, as similar treatment is not meted out to other investments (such as antiques, art work, collectibles and other less liquid investments upon which there could also be an unrealised capital gain which is not to be treated as income).</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Shareholder pensioners in similar assets and income positions will be treated differently because of the type of share asset owned. In a submission made to all Senators, the Chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange, Mr Laurence Cox, has argued that, under this proposal, shareholders in a publicly non-listed company (such as Linfox) will not be affected by the change, but investors in a listed company (such as TNT) will be.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is possible that investors will be encouraged to invest overseas and not in Australia, as those investments are unaffected by the proposed change. For example, Mr Cox has suggested investors may elect to invest in IBM shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange purchased through an Australian broker, rather than invest in BHP. Accordingly, this move may well discourage small scale investment in Australian companies at a time when such investment is desperately needed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">25. The likely outcome of the Government's move is that many, if not all, of the 85 000 pensioners presently holding share portfolios will sell their shares. I note that Mr Michael Heffernan, the Stock Exchange's chief economist, believes a `significant number' of pensioners will sell, adding that he doubts the Government's ability to reach its projected savings of more than $85 million a year `because no-one will have the shares.' (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Age</EMPHASIS>, 5 December 1992).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">26. Once again, it makes little sense to be discouraging investment in Australian companies at the present time.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The flawed nature of the formula to be used in assessing gains and losses (set out in Clause 116 of the Bill) combined with the volatility of the share market will result in inequities, as illustrated by the following examples.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A share portfolio increases in value from $10 000 to $12 000 over the 12 month period prior to the day of assessment and pays a dividend of $500. The return (for social security purposes) is $2 500: the increase in capital value ($2 000) plus the distribution ($500). The return expressed as a percentage of the value of the asset at the start of the review year is 25 per cent. Under the formula, the past rate of return is applied to the current asset's value. So the past percentage value is applied to the asset value on the day of assessment&mdash;that is, 25 per cent of $12 000, or $3 000. So we end up with the situation where the DSS calculated income figure of $3 000 is $500 more than the actual return.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where share prices fall, the dollar amount of the loss relates to the value of the assets at the start of the review year and the resulting percentage is applied to the lower closing price. For example, in the situation in 5.1 (above), if&mdash;in the subsequent year&mdash;the asset value reverts to $10 000, the $2 000 capital loss is related to the $12 000 opening value and the result is a negative rate of return of 16.67 per cent. That percentage is applied to the closing value of $10 000 and a negative return is calculated ($1 667) which may be offset against gains on other securities, but not other source of income.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These examples demonstrate that the formula magnifies gains and minimises losses. In the example above, a $2 000 gain was assessed as $2 500; however, a $2 000 loss attracted a credit of only $1 667. This becomes a problem where a shareholder has two parcels of shares, one of which rises in value and the other falls in value. If the shareholder's two parcels are each valued at $10 000 and one goes up by $2 000 and the other falls by $2 000 (assuming no dividends are paid), the shareholder's DSS calculated income will be $800 ($2 400 income offset by a $1 600 loss), despite the fact there was no capital gain across the entire portfolio. The greater the variation in the price, the greater the calculated income (irrespective of whether or not any actual gain has accrued).</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, pension losses caused by share price increases cannot be fully offset by the same drop in share prices.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This particular problem in the formula also demonstrates the inequity in the treatment between a person with an `individual' share portfolio and a person who has invested in a managed investment with an identical shareholding. Each gain and loss on the individual's shareholdings are going to be separately assessed and (as pointed out in 5.3) will result in assessable income even if there is no overall net change in the asset value. But the managed investment will have no assessable income where there is no net capital gain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">27. It is also quite clear that, unless DSS reviews are all carried out on the same day (and there has been no suggestion this will occur), pensioners with identical share holdings and the same dividend income could have markedly different pension outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">28. The ability to offset losses is not as positive as it initially appears. This is partly because of the magnification of profits and minimisation of losses already mentioned and partly because of the requirement that losses can only be offset within the same time period against income from other shares or managed funds (not against income from other sources).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">29. This makes a mockery of statements by the Government that the move is `fair' because reductions in share values will be able to be offset against gains.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">30. The measure has the potential to result in significant administrative costs for the Department of Social Security as it will be extremely difficult to keep track of market fluctuations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 3&mdash;Senator Kernot</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is recommended that the proposed amendments in the Bill relating to unrealised capital gains on shares, as set out in Division 18, be rejected and the Department of Social Security be advised to re-examine the proposed formula.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">B. Allocated Pensions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">31. The Bill also changes the manner in which allocated pensions and annuities are assessed for the purposes of the income and assets tests. Under the proposed amendments, both unrealised capital gains and income applying to allocated pensions will be treated as earned income for the purposes of the age pension assets and income tests. At present, allocated pensions are assessed under the income test only (using a different assessment method to that proposed by the amendments).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">32. There is no problem with the move to have the pensions assessed under both tests. The problem in the application of the new income test being proposed by DSS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">33. At present, allocated pensions and annuities are assessed in the same way for the purposes of the income test, that is, DSS assesses the actual amount of income paid on these investments (less the tax concessions). Under the proposed amendments, DSS will assess the earnings of the allocated pension's underlying capital rather than the actual income drawn down.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">34. DSS estimates this change will save about $2 million a year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">35. This measure is also highly unsatisfactory for several reasons.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The vast majority of allocated pension holders will be assessed by DSS to be earning more income than they actually receive. They will have their pensions reduced even though their allocated pension income has not changed.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is inconsistent with moves in the taxation area where allocated pensions, annuities and other superannuation products are treated in an equal manner. Because of the withdrawal rates applied by DSS, the loss of $1 in income through the application of the income test is equal to a $1 increase in taxation. This cannot be seen as enhancing the integration of the taxation and social security systems.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Memorandum states that, as the drawings from an allocated pension are variable, it would operate `in a similar way to a bank account . . . at the recipient's discretion.' This would seem to represent a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of allocated pensions. Allocated pensions can only be opened while applicants are in employment and then only with rollover funds or ETPs, deposits are not permitted, drawings are restricted to government prescribed maximum and minimum limits and can only be made monthly, and most (if not all) allocated pensions only allow the pensioner to vary the amount to be drawn on an annual basis. Therefore, the pensioner's discretion in relation to the allocated pension is severely curtailed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">36. In evidence to the Committee, DSS said they were attempting to `provide neutral treatment vis-a-vis other similar sorts of investments.' But an examination of the structure and purpose of the product suggests it is stretching both logic and equity to propose they be treated as ordinary investments.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, it makes considerably more sense to treat allocated pensions in the same way as annuities. This is particularly so in light of the Government's clear statements to the personal investment industry that it prefers retirement benefits to be taken more in income stream form.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">37. In evidence to the Committee, DSS advised it accepted a `similarity' between term annuities and allocated pensions. DSS went on to say: `For that reason, we will be doing a review of the treatment of term annuities . . . [to be] submitted to the Government by the end of January.' It makes little sense to proceed with these changes to the treatment of allocated pensions when a review of annuities is underway in the Department.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because an allocated pension is structured in order to build up an investor's capital in the initial stages of the life of the product, the income received during this period is less than what the underlying capital is earning. The likely outcome of the new rules is that people will increase the size of their allocated pension drawings, defeating the purpose of the product and possibly making allocated pensioners onto the age pension at an earlier stage.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">DSS made it quite clear to the Committee that it had no consultation with the providers of these products prior to introducing the changes to allocated pensions. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission has had extensive consultation with the industry on allocated pensions. Mr Michael O'Neill, Assistant Commissioner of the ISC, told the Committee the ISC had received submissions on allocated pensions as long as 12 or 18 months ago. He said `There were some components of those submissions concerning DSS matters, but that was not our concern.'</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is recommended that the proposed amendments in the Bill relating to allocated pensions, as set out in Division 19, be rejected and DSS be advised to include an exploration of more equitable treatment between allocated pensions and annuities within its current review of term annuities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Preservation Age</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">38. As part of the package of changes negotiated prior to the introduction of the SGC, the Democrats insisted that the Government address the question of an increase in the preservation age. We proposed that an appropriate phase-in period for this necessary change was 10-15 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">39. This was not accepted by the Government because of external pressures, although the Government did agree to a much slower implementation timetable. This at least shows that the Government does acknowledge that a potentially large problem exists in this area&mdash;especially as Australia now has a uniform national superannuation system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">40. The relevant industry and professional bodies, namely ASFA, LIFA and the Institute of Actuaries, all welcome the Government's decision in this area. However, they are unsure as to why such a simple and overdue change should take place over a timeframe of over 30 years. I share these sentiments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">41. It is an absurd situation where the Government refuses to address an acknowledged flaw in its policy, which has serious long-term consequences, because of external pressures.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I will very briefly speak to that minority report. In relation to the unrealised capital gains on shares, the Democrats believe the Department and the Government need to go away and take another look altogether at this proposal. I understand the Opposition will not oppose this measure despite the comments that Senator Alston and Senator Watson made in the Senate Committee's minority report. They said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many problems associated with the proposal to include unrealised capital gains in the Social Security income means test and we are disturbed that this was not the subject of a coordinated review to ensure equity of treatment.</PARA>
<PARA>There was not any review and there certainly is not equity of treatment. I also remind Senator Alston of his comments on this particular measure not long after the Budget on 9 September as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition spokesman on retirement incomes, Senator Richard Alston, said the Government's tough line against pensioner investments contrasted with the tax free capital gain made by the Prime Minister through his share in a piggery. "The changes proposed will mean that many thousands of pensioners will face reduction in pension incomes because of unrealised capital gains on their hard earned investments," Senator Alston said.</PARA>
<PARA>I can only ask the Opposition to think again because absolutely nothing has changed since Senator Alston made that comment. I point out that Mr Tim Fischer, the Leader of the National Party, has made comments in this area as well. He issued a press release on 25 August from which I will quote very briefly. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pensioners along the Murray Valley will be hard hit by a new Budget proposal which involves a form of non-realised Capital Gains tax . . . Labor's pensioner special tax is wrong . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I ask again, particularly of the National Party senators: what has changed? I would argue that absolutely nothing has changed. Unfortunately, I think that later today we will see them voting with the Government. Presumably this is another example of a Clayton's opposition&mdash;the opposition you have when you really are not having an opposition. It really is most unfortunate. What about those people who are disadvantaged with all this political game playing? What if honourable senators opposite do not actually get into office in order to be able to take off these restrictions? It is game playing of the most cynical kind. It is not fair to those people who will be affected&mdash;indeed, those people who are placing some reliance on the public statements that the Opposition has made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to allocated pensions, as far as the Democrats are concerned it makes absolutely no sense at all to proceed with these changes to treatment of allocated pensions when a review of annuities is under way.

We are not terribly impressed by this. However, I think the evidence presented to the Senate Select Committee is quite convincing. We should be saying to the Government, `Go away and do more work on this'. But, looking at what the Opposition is proposing, it is certainly better than letting this issue pass through today. We will therefore be supporting the Opposition because we are not into playing games; we really do think we should be looking at people's incomes, particularly our retired people's incomes&mdash;pension incomes&mdash;and the effect that these measures will be having on their lives. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first half of 1991 I alerted the Senate to the extent of this information exchange and the lack of effective legislation to prevent its ongoing occurrence. In New South Wales, the Independent Commission Against Corruption has heard evidence of personal information being obtained without authorisation from a large number of Federal agencies, including the Department of Social Security, the Health Insurance Commission, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the Australian Customs Service, Australia Post and Telecom. My efforts resulted in an inquiry into the unauthorised disclosure and procurement of government information by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. However, the Government merely paid lip service to this inquiry. Only when it came under considerable media attention following the release of the ICAC report this year has the Federal Government finally moved to give this important matter its due consideration. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second social security related Bill before the Senate is the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Amendment Bill 1992. Initially this Bill sought to discard the sunset clause inserted in the original Bill by the coalition which meant that parliamentary approval was required to continue the data-matching program beyond two years of operation. I know that some have argued this is a rather arduous task, but I believe it is a necessary task so that we, as representatives of the people, and the public can scrutinise more closely this process and the procedure that takes place in the data-matching operation. The Government relented when the shadow Minister, Mr Connolly, foreshadowed that the coalition would seek to extend the sunset clause until January 1994 with a further report from the matching and assistance agencies in October 1993. </PARA>

<PARA>When the original legislation was before the Senate Committee, departmental officers were adamant about the accuracy of the results that would be obtained from data-matching. However, in the latest Social Security data-matching report it is revealed that, in the latest data-matching cycle, 80 per cent of so-called matches were not acted upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the recent Estimates hearings, a Social Security official readily admitted that in the early stages some data-matching programs were nowhere near as sharp and refined as they could have been. It is amazing to hear this when we heard the evidence at the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee about it being such a whiz bang system; it was going to be A-okay and we were going to get 95 per cent correct matches. The official said that he did not think the program would get to the stage where 90 per cent of matches would be cases where there is an overpayment. Now officials are saying that we are not going to quite achieve what they said when they were originally setting up the data-matching program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Long may the Senate remember the former Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson&mdash;if we can remember him&mdash;claiming that he was so concerned about the privacy considerations relating to data-matching that step 5 would be no more than 24 hours in duration. Thankfully, the coalition's amendments to the original Bill resulted in stringent operational requirements to protect the privacy of individual Australians. While not opposing this amendment, which has the Privacy Commissioner's approval, I remain concerned that this Bill will provide for unlimited, ongoing changes to the matching algorithm. Surely once a particular algorithm has been refined, there is no need to continue to send the information back and forth between the matching and source agencies during later matching cycles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A concern I expressed during the briefing was that permitting agencies to have this extra time may mean that they are a bit sloppy in setting up their original algorithm and that they may think, `If it does not work this time, we will have another go at it, and we will have time to do it'. I put those agencies on notice that we will be looking very carefully&mdash;because we have been told the number of times that they repeat a data-matching run&mdash;at how often they have to do it to see whether they have fallen into the trap of thinking this is a bit easy and, `If we don't get it right the first time, we'll have a second bash at it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's main concern about the implementation of the data-matching legislation is the fact that the Government's estimates of the savings that would have derived from this program have nowhere near been realised. For example, in the Social Security portfolio it was originally estimated that $290m would be saved during 1991-92. In actual fact, the savings amounted to $25.3m. All sorts of excuses were given as to why there were shortfalls. There was the fact that there has been a recession; and the fact that other measures were much better than had been anticipated. All sorts of other excuses were given as to why the savings were not as great. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the gun that was held at our head. Senator Lees would remember this. We were told, `These will be the savings. If you do not have this data-matching, this is the cost it will be to the public'. There was no concept that other processes would reap benefits, or correct estimates of the benefits of the other mechanisms to reduce fraud. So the Department has again given us estimates that are not very good; they are very rubbery, in fact. I think the Senate was, in some ways, hoodwinked about the benefits which would be derived from data-matching. We are now living with it and, as far as the coalition is concerned, we monitor it very closely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third social security Bill before the Senate is the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3). This Bill seeks to introduce the more substantial initiatives announced in the Budget. It provides for an increase in mobility allowance of $10 a fortnight from 1 January 1993. The mobility allowance will be indexed with the CPI. A person will be allowed to take a six-month advance in mobility allowance. The mobility allowance will be extended to people with disabilities who are looking for work or doing voluntary work. We support these amendments which will provide more incentive and facilitate re-entry into the work force. It needs to be stated that a coalition government will introduce a disability allowance of $45 a fortnight for people with a 70 per cent and higher impairment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill increases the employment entry payment for DSPs from $100 to $300 while the 12 months continuous entitlement requirement is also removed. A $100 employment entry payment will be introduced for sole parents in receipt of special benefit and widow B pensioners. An education entry payment for disability service pensioners commencing education will also be introduced. Again, the coalition supports these changes which are designed to encourage people into the work force. It also should be noted that Fightback increases employment entry payments for sole parent pensioners and the long term unemployed from $100 to $400 and $200 respectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government announced in the Budget that it would change the method of calculating rent assistance from 20 March 1993. The current $25 a week threshold will be replaced by four thresholds depending on a person's family and marital status. The weekly rate of rent assistance will be increased from 50c to 75c in each dollar of rent paid above the threshold. While the Department claims these changes will increase rent assistance for 68,000 beneficiaries, a saving provision has been inserted to protect current beneficiaries who would otherwise be disadvantaged. As happened with deeming, this savings provision will mean that people with identical incomes and in identical circumstances will be treated differently under the Social Security Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Budget decision to move forward the indexation of pensions and benefits from 20 March 1993 to 28 January 1993 is a poorly disguised, politically motivated bribe in the run-up to the next Federal election. That maybe gives us some clues as to the election date. Single pensioners will receive $6 per fortnight increase while married pensioners will receive $10 per fortnight increase. These pale into insignificance compared with the Fightback commitment to increase the single pension by $24.10 per fortnight and the married pension by $40.20 per fortnight and maintain indexation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government also announced in the Budget that the fringe benefits income test for pensioners would be removed. In theory this would mean all part rate pensioners would become eligible for the fringe benefits provided by local councils and State governments as well as the Federal Government. However, the vast majority of these benefits are provided by the States and this initiative is dependent upon obtaining the agreement of the States about appropriate compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Undoubtedly the initiative in this Bill which has engendered most debate is the Budget decision to treat capital gains and losses from listed shares and securities as income under the Social Security Act. Community opinion in relation to this proposal is divided. On the one hand, leading retirement incomes expert Mr Daryl Dixon supports the initiative, claiming it will reduce the artificial distortions that presently favour some investments over others. The Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Foundation is `generally supportive of the changes themselves' as they will treat people consistently. However, it is concerned about what it perceives to be their retrospective effect. On the other hand, ACOA, the Australian Council on the Ageing, is opposed to the initiative for a number of reasons. Its chief concern relates to its belief that it is a de facto assets test which entails an unacceptably harsh pension withdrawal rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of points must be made about this proposal. First, it must be remembered that the Government estimates that 60,000 people will be affected by this initiative. This represents 5 per cent of all age pensioners. One-third of these pensioners will have a reduction of less than $10 a week. The Government has stressed that a relatively small percentage of pensioners will be adversely affected to any significant extent by this initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it needs to be pointed out that this proposal brings the treatment of listed shares into line with other types of investments such as managed linked investments. In 1988, the Government moved to prevent pensioners from circumventing the incomes test by treating unrealised capital gains from these investments as income. This proposal will rid the system of the current distortion whereby managed investments and listed shares are treated differently under the income test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, in relation to concerns about the retrospectivity of the proposal, it must be pointed out that the Government has decided to apply the new rules from September 1993. This will give shareholders significant time to change their investments if they so wish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, it should be noted that there remains at least one investment avenue that will continue to be outside the unrealised income test. Income on property is treated on a receipt basis rather than an accrual basis. The Department claims that property has to be treated differently as it is a lumpy investment which usually must be sold as a whole rather than in portions. However, this does not mean that the Department should not be vigilant in ensuring that valuations of property investments are accurate and up to date. This has not always been the case in the past. In fact, one only has to look at the ANAO report in an efficiency audit released in June 1991 to see that this has not always been the case. It should be noted that the Government moved to rectify this situation in the 1991 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will support the divisions of the legislation relating to the treatment of unrealised capital gains on listed shares and securities under the income tests. However, I must stress, and it must be remembered, that these amendments will only take effect from September 1993. Consequently, I give notice&mdash;and again stress&mdash;that the coalition will review these provisions when in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is concerned about the mechanics of this proposal. In particular, we are concerned that the proposed formula to be used may not treat capital gains and capital losses equitably and fairly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is also concerned about the amendments in the Bill which will mean that both unrealised capital gains and income applying to allocated pensions will be treated as earned income for the purposes of the age pension assets and income test. The ISC has recently developed rules which expand the definition of annuities in such a way as to include allocated pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, these proposed amendments to the Social Security Act, by denying allocated pensions the same treatment already given to annuities in the income and assets test, may undo that good work and fly in the face of the stated policy of encouraging allocated pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the evidence to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation the Department admitted a `similarity' between annuities and allocated pensions and advised that it would undertake a review of the treatment of annuities. Given that this proposal has not been the subject of any coordinated review to ensure equity of treatment, the coalition will move in the committee stage to delay the onset of these amendments until 1 October 1993 or until the completion of a further inquiry by an appropriate Senate committee, whichever is the latter. Otherwise, the coalition supports these two Budget Bills, and the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Amendment Bill, although we are extremely concerned about the hasty way that they have been forced through the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to confine my rather short remarks to the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 1992. I preface my remarks by quoting from the beginning of Justice Toohey's judgment in the recent High Court case known as Bushell's case, which was delivered on 7 October of this year, only a few weeks ago. Justice Toohey stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The history of legislative attempts to provide a satisfactory formula for the determination of claims for service-related incapacities has not been a happy one. A glance at the index to the series, Administrative Law Decisions, under the heading "Veterans' Affairs", gives some idea of the amount of litigation the relevant legislation has spawned.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason I have risen to speak in this debate is that I believe that over the last 10 years or so there have been very strong attempts by the Repatriation Commission to subvert the longstanding intentions of Parliament in favour of claims for war-caused injuries by veterans. In fact, over these years the High Court has continuously by its several decisions supported the intention of Parliament, yet in these years the Government has supported the attempts of the Repatriation Commission to change that longstanding tradition. Fortunately&mdash;and I commend the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, who is at the table&mdash;the Government has now got up some courage of its own and has been standing up to the pressures and blandishments that it has clearly been receiving from the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill we are debating is yet another classic and the most gross example of all of these legislative attempts which Justice Toohey has referred to as being `not a happy one'. The Bill purports, as previous Bills have, to change the law from the way it has been interpreted by the High Court, and to change it certainly from what has been the longstanding intention of Parliament. This Bill is the last and the worst example of that attempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Bill has already been sent to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. As a result of the hearings of that Committee, the Government has now retreated extensively, if not comprehensively, from the position presented to this Parliament in the form of the Bill, the second reading of which we are debating. So I am perfectly entitled to make comments upon the Bill as presented to us. However, the Government has now presented amendments which amount to a massive reversal of what was attempted by the Government in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, because of the history of these years, the veteran community is still very suspicious and very concerned about the effect even of the Government's amendments, which on the face of it are really a major reversal of the proposals in the Bill as they have been presented to us. I can understand therefore the veteran community wanting more time to fully consider it, because it has every reason not to trust this Government and certainly not to trust the Repatriation Commission in relation to the vital issue of its war-caused disabilities or death. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I will certainly be supporting the motion that has already been moved by my colleague, Senator Newman, to defer further consideration of this Bill, after the second reading debate, so that this matter can be properly considered by what is going to be a summit meeting of the veteran community early in February next year. It seems to be only fair to them, as a result of their deep and justified concerns&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue at stake here is really the question of how it is proved and what is the standard of proof as required for what is called the causation issue in relation to claims by veterans. That is, the veterans have to prove a number of things: that there has been the incident of their war service and that they have an injury or death has occurred. Proving the incident may also be a problem, but the major problem is the issue of causation; whether the injury or death that has been proved has in fact been caused by war service. That is the issue which has been the predominant issue in this line of legislative changes and the High Court and other court decisions over a period now of about 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My attention has been drawn to a very potted history of veterans' affairs legislation as set out in the explanatory memorandum to the legislation. I want to address myself to that because one can only understand the nature of the present problem and the concerns of the veterans community if we know something about the history of this matter. Since 1929, repatriation legislation has given particular favour to the veterans in their attempts to prove their cases for compensation. The nature of that favour has changed from time to time, but there has always been what is called the benefit of the doubt to which the veteran or his dependant is entitled.

<PARA>I do not think the Department, or whoever is the author of this explanatory memorandum, knows that the Repatriation Commission, at some stage in the 1950s or 1960s, received an opinion from the Attorney-General of the day&mdash;who, incidentally, was Sir Garfield Barwick&mdash;that the proper interpretation of this provision was, in effect, that the Commission had to disprove the claim; not just on the balance of probabilities, not just on any benefit of a doubt, but beyond reasonable doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That opinion was well known to the veterans' community, as I am only too well aware, because I became the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in 1976 and the Toose report had been brought down and my main responsibility was, on behalf of the Government, to implement the Toose report. It was made perfectly clear to me that the veterans community knew all about this and expected that that was its right; that the veterans were entitled to the requirement that the Commission had to disprove their claim beyond reasonable doubt. Although Toose did not actually recommend that formula, we were not in the business of taking anything away from the veteran community and nor was Mr Justice Toose. In redrafting the legislation, we gave the right of proof beyond reasonable doubt, which is now enshrined in the Act, to veterans. It is that particular matter which this Repatriation Commission, in the last decade or so, has been absolutely determined to modify and hopefully reverse. That is my major complaint and the reason why I am speaking here tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1977, or thereabouts, in accordance with the recommendations of Mr Justice Toose, but not contained in the same Bill, we introduced for the first time a right of appeal on a question of law from the administrative tribunals, which determine these things and still do, to the Federal Court and ultimately to the High Court. That is where all of this litigation has occurred, as mentioned by Mr Justice Toohey. Indeed, there have been three landmark decisions of the High Court in relation to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first case was that of Mrs Law in 1981, the second being the case of Mr O'Brien in 1985 and the most recent case being that of Mr Bushell. The interesting thing about all of these cases is that the facts of them all clearly exemplify why Parliament wanted to give this benefit of the doubt. In the case of Mrs Law, her husband died from lung cancer and the opinion in her favour was none other than Sir Weary Dunlop. What tribunal would not accept, on the case of a prisoner of war, the opinion of Sir Weary Dunlop? There was ample evidence to prove the case, but the Repatriation Commission fought the case bitterly right through to the High Court and, of course, the High Court rolled the Commission comprehensively, and so it should have, because of the state of the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Mr O'Brien, there was perhaps some criticism that could be made about some remarks of the majority judges of the High Court, and it was in the dissenting opinion of Mr Justice Brennan that the Department found some comfort and which has been the basis of the recent legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of O'Brien, there was a very clear conflict of expert medical opinion. Whether or not the decision was correctly made, and whether or not the majority of the High Court was correct, the fact is that it is precisely the sort of case to which this long legislative history is directed. One does not decide these things as in a court of law. That was the trouble in the O'Brien case. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal thought it had to weigh up the medical evidence, as it would do if it were in a court. But that is not the test. The test is whether or not there is a reasonable doubt which has to be resolved in favour of the claimant. Bushell's case, of all cases, is probably the most striking example of that exercise. Again, there is conflict of specialist medical evidence, and again the results of all the legal appeals, and the High Court decision, were totally consistent with what has always been the intention of this Parliament in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I am so concerned by the continual efforts that are being made to reverse that longstanding policy by this Government, no doubt at the instigation of the Repatriation Commission. The Law case was decided when we were still in Government, and we were pressed pretty closely by all the same sort of `shock, horror' about the cost of the things that were presented to us. At least we did not fall for it in government and try to reverse the Law case. But this Government has continually tried to reverse these decisions, which ultimately have been made by the High Court and which the Government does not like. Ultimately, we have these amendments here today which are really a naked attempt not just to ameliorate the High Court decision but to reverse that longstanding standard of proof and onus on the Commission to disprove the claim of the veteran. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to have had time to delve deeper into all the reasons I am making these very strong criticisms of the Commission. I do not propose to do so tonight, but I wish to show where the High Court has ultimately come down on what has been the longstanding intention of Parliament, going back to 1929 and, in its present form, at least to 1943. Even if it is going to cost more money, there is no reason why veterans should be deprived of what has been a longstanding right. Tomorrow we are likely to be debating the dispatch of another battalion to a high-risk situation&mdash;Somalia. Only two years ago we were sending our naval forces on another high-risk mission to the Gulf. There is growing demand for our peacekeeping forces. Why should we, in this case, expect these men and women to face risks to their lives and to their limbs if we, as parliamentarians, were persuaded by the sorts of pressures that have been put upon us by the Repatriation Commission and this Government to take away or at least greatly modify the rights which they have traditionally had?</PARA>

The amendments that have been circulated by the Government are in response to this Committee's report and some further concerns raised by representatives of the ex-service community in meetings with the Repatriation Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the public hearing before the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee there was some difference of opinion as to the consequences of the Bushell decision for the Repatriation pension system. There was argument that the strictly binding aspect of the High Court's decision had a limited application and that there was no need to amend the VEA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's difficulty with the Bushell decision stems from the judicial statements made in the reasons for decision. While these statements may or may not be strictly binding on decision makers, the Repatriation Commission, as the primary determining authority, recognises that such judicial statements are given considerable weight in the repatriation claims process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's concern that the Bushell decision has significantly widened the scope of claims that would be successful was initially based on the opinion of the Solicitor-General, Senior Counsel and the Repatriation Commission. These views received further independent endorsement in the Australian Administrative Law Bulletin's analysis of the Bushell decision which recognised the "likelihood that the decision will lead to an unexpected increase in disability and widow's pension payouts" and indicated that the High Court's interpretation is more generous than that which decision makers previously have generally applied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has also listened carefully to the points of view expressed by the ex-service representatives at the Committee hearings and in subsequent discussions with the Repatriation Commission. The Repatriation Commission has obtained further legal advice as to how these concerns could be met. That advice reaffirmed the need for legislation to set out more clearly the claims determining process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am aware that there is a strongly held view in the ex-service community that there is no need to make any amendments to the legislation following the Bushell case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It remains the Government's view that the Bushell decision, if unchecked, will, in time, result in increases in costs and inequities. Further the Auditor-General in his recently tabled Audit Report No. 8 stated that the Bushell decision "widened the interpretation of the favourable nature of the `reasonable hypothesis'" and could lead to "the great majority of claims being accepted".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As has been clearly stated by the Government, the purpose of the Amendment Bill is to overturn those aspects of the Bushell decision that were considered to be inconsistent with the position that has prevailed under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 as interpreted in a line of Federal Court decisions commencing with the East case and endorsed by a majority of the Full Bench of the Federal Court in Repatriation Commission v Bushell.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What the Government is concerned about in the Bushell decision is the possibility that what the High Court refers to as "raised facts" should be assumed to be true upon their mere assertion by the claimant. While not accepting this is the interpretation intended by the High Court, such a view, if adopted by a decision maker, is likely to go far beyond the position the Government would regard as being acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of the amendments that I have circulated place a clear focus on the process to be followed by decision makers in determining claims for pension. The amendments leave untouched the present standard of proof provisions as contained in sub-sections 120(1) and (3) of the VEA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process proposed makes it clear that, as a first step, the decision maker needs to establish the circumstances of the veteran's operational service and the facts about the incapacity claimed by a veteran or the death claimed by a widow. Following that fact finding process, the possible link between the veteran's incapacity or death and his operational service needs to be assessed. This is to be done on the basis of whether or not a reasonable hypothesis as to a link is raised following an evaluation of all the available material.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By limiting the amendments to changes to ensure a properly structured process of fact finding and evaluation I believe we have met the essential concerns of the ex-service community with the contents of the Bill as originally introduced. The Government believes that in following the process detailed a decision maker will be able to apply the standard of proof correctly. This should lead to better consistency and therefore a more equitable system of claims determination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This process will ensure that, if after the evaluation of all the relevant material, any reasonable hypothesis of a connection with war service is raised then the claim for pension will succeed. It will not be a matter of preferring one reasonable hypothesis to another.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Bushell case, both the majority judgement and that of Brennan J make it clear that a decision maker can reject material raised by a claimant to support an hypothesis of causation on the basis of unreliability of that material or because of the superior reliability of other parts of the material before the decision maker, or, because the raised facts depend on inferences that the decision maker is satisfied cannot be drawn. The Government believes that this interpretation is consistent with its intentions when the 1986 legislative changes were made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bearing in mind that the Repatriation System is an inquisitorial process in which the decision maker is required to obtain and to examine all the relevant evidence and that neither the Repatriation Commission nor the claimant bears any onus of proof as in an adversarial system, most people have little difficulty with the procedures I have outlined. Indeed it is consistent with the conclusion reached by the VEA Monitoring Committee chaired by Mr Justice Toose when it said that, if properly followed, the decision in the East case achieved the Government's stated intention for the 1986 legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Justice Toose has seen the amendments I am now proposing and is satisfied that they do no more than confirm and underline the proper process of decision making to be applied in the Repatriation System.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments now proposed do fall short of achieving all of the Government's original intentions for the Bill. For instance, the issue of "opinion shopping" seeking support for tenuous linkages to war service and the related issue of medical or scientific opinion of limited standing are not specifically dealt with. As I have explained the Government is prepared at this point to rely on the revised procedural process to minimise the risk from these problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The original explanatory memorandum to the Bill provided an estimate, based on assumptions of increased claims and success rates and mortality rates, of increased program costs. The amendments now proposed will not eliminate all of the anticipated additional program expenditure. The extent to which the Bill meets its original objectives will, therefore, need to be monitored.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On behalf of the Government, the Repatriation Commission will closely monitor, in consultation with the ex-service community, the impact of these legislative changes on the outcomes of the claims process. If these amendments prove to be insufficient to deal with the practical impact of the Bushell decision, thereby causing a blow out in the taxpayers liability under the Repatriation system, then the Government will reconsider its position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion Mr President, I would like to make another brief reference to the Auditor General's Report No. 8. As Senator Newman mentioned here on 2 December the report provides a contemporary analysis of Repatriation legislation and practices. The Government agrees that the report can provide a basis for further review of the Repatriation system and is considering how this process might be pursued. The Minister has asked the Repatriation Commission to meet with the ex-service community to hear their views before taking a decision on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the meantime, I reiterate the Government's firm view for the need for legislative action at this time to ensure continued fairness for veterans and taxpayers. In reaching this position, the Government cannot be as confident that it's concerns arising from the Bushell decision have been dealt with comprehensively. Nevertheless it recognises the realities of its position in the Senate. The Government is not prepared to open itself to the charge of fiscal irresponsibility or that it has countenanced inequitable application of the law by not making a serious and practical attempt to clarify the confusion created by the comments made in the High Court case that leave open the suggestion that a claim for Repatriation pension might be determined by a less structured process than that which I have outlined above.</PARA>

<PARA>This amendment relates to the shares which will now be deemed to have increased in value as far as pension income is concerned. I wish to just remind the Government that this is extremely short sighted and penny-pinching. I do not know whether the Government is aware, but what is most likely to happen is that pensioners will divest themselves of their shareholdings. This will not affect large shareholdings; those people are already out under the assets and income test. This will only affect those pensioners with relatively small volumes of shares, and they do not know whether, indeed, they will increase in value from year to year. It seems, from those who have contacted us, that what is most likely is that they will decide to move their money out of shares. At a time when companies such as Arnotts are under threat from takeover&mdash;and we have heard a lot in this place about concerns for that&mdash;nothing practical is being done to encourage people to keep their shares in Australian companies. I therefore recommend that we delete these clauses and leave the status quo as it is. </PARA>

<PARA>As honourable senators will recall, these amendments relate to the Government's decision to treat both unrealised capital gains and income applying to the assets underlying allocated pensions as earned income for the age pension means test and to include the capital value of allocated pensions in the assets test.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although allocated pensions received the Government's endorsement in its security in retirement policy statement last June, the proposed amendments will do nothing to advance their use.

<PARA>It is simply hypocritical for the Government to state now that allocated pensions should be afforded less favourable treatment. Accordingly, the coalition deplores the Government's failure to develop a consistent and equitable retirement incomes policy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that, if one reads Senator Patterson's amendments and tries to envisage what would happen if there were an adverse Senate committee report&mdash;according to her amendments, the Bill would then become effective and the provision would come into effect&mdash;one could see that this would create a tremendous amount of uncertainty and difficulty. Basically, it is putting off the matter in the hope that the Opposition may come into government and deal with the matter. It is a little opposite to what was happening last night with the Medicare Agreements Bill, so I suppose that Senator Patterson has had her revenge in that respect. The Government will be opposing these amendments because of the uncertainty this would create in this market, which we still think is an important one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a question for the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) in relation to the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Amendment Bill 1992. The Minister gave me a commitment on Thursday, 12 November this year about the company called Med-Network. He gave me an assurance that he would provide the information that I had sought, and said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We can provide answers to those questions, particularly on the structure of the organisation, certainly by the time the Senate resumes on Tuesday.</PARA>

<PARA>The Minister responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I suppose I can find some mechanism to table what will astound Senator Knowles as a most comprehensive answer.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have been delighted if it had astounded me, but the written answer that I got certainly nowhere near fitted the bill in terms of being comprehensive. The Minister did not bring it back into the chamber and the questions I asked remain unanswered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether I will ever get an answer to that question. I wonder who formed the company, why it was formed and who the directors were. The answer that the Minister provided to me in writing said that Med-Network is no longer owned by any of the original shareholders. That was not my question. I want to know who the original shareholders were, who the shareholders are today and whether Mr Lawrie Willett from the HIC happens to be one of them. Was this tendered for? If so, on what basis? How did the whole thing arise?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I gave the Minister credit for coming back and sticking to his word that he had given me on 12 November.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am conscious of the hours that the Senate has been sitting. I will be very brief and speak for a only few minutes. I rise to speak on a matter of grave concern affecting South Australia's farming community, particularly grain growers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South Australian Farmers Federation President, Mr Tim Scholz, spoke on South Australian regional radio today about the disaster facing many farmers because of the continuing unseasonal weather which has seen returns for the grain harvest in South Australia decimated in many areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of drought and its associated hardships are well publicised and documented, but at least in a period of drought primary producers have the opportunity to prepare themselves and, to some degree, manage their ongoing costs and outlays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South Australian farmers today have been through a period of record winter and spring rainfall and so most areas were expecting above average to record yields from both grain and legumes. They outlaid extra finance for sprays not normally needed for weed control and crop diseases. Many farmers also purchased new machinery and equipment to cope with a bumper harvest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the unprecedented and extreme wet weather has seen their optimism turn to disaster. The continuing wet weather&mdash;far in excess of what could be expected&mdash;has delayed harvesting, resulting in shot grain and impossible harvesting conditions. Wheat delivered by farmers with more than one per cent of the grain shot has been downgraded from milling grade to stock feed grade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the wheat harvest on the Eyre Peninsula and other areas normally falls into two categories, Australian standard white or hard, which this year are worth $154 and $168 a tonne respectively. But feed grain put in the general pool is now worth only $135 a tonne. This means the return to growers in some cases can be below the cost of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr David Lewis, an agronomist with the Department of Primary Industries in Cleve, has had reports from silo staff on Eyre Peninsula that up to 99 per cent of grain receivals are being downgraded. Some wheat has been completely rejected at the silo delivery point and has to be taken back to the property having no current commercial value. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is devastating to the people.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EP5">Senator FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is devastating. The estimated loss to individual farmers on Eyre Peninsula because of this weather damage is in excess of $40,000 per farmer. This comes at a time when ABARE is predicting the average Australian broadacre farmer will lose $25,700 this financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today Mr Scholz estimated the total direct cash loss to grain growers on Eyre Peninsula alone to be $70m. This does not take into account the losses from districts where the grain harvest has scarcely commenced due to the continuing wet weather. The multiplier effect on the State's economy is three to four times. Therefore, we are looking at a disaster of devastating proportions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect on the viability of farmers who have been struggling to survive and whose confidence had been boosted by good rainfall is that they will be placed in an even more precarious position. In addition to the wheat harvest, most of the State's barley crop has been downgraded and the Australian Barley Board says the continual rain has affected malting quality in barley deliveries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legume crops have been either wiped out or are at least returning much lower yields. Faba beans and peas are not worth harvesting in many cases and vetch has been affected by rust and other diseases. Farmers on northern Eyre Peninsula and the northern Mallee have been badly affected by a series of crop diseases, including haydie and stem, stripe and leaf rust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Alan Dube, head of the Department of Primary Industries plant pathology unit, says that haydie&mdash;a fungus that thrives in wet conditions&mdash;is threatening to wipe $60m worth of grain off the State's cereal crops this year. The weather has also put at risk the grape harvest and the fruit and vegetable harvests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987, during an extremely difficult period for farmers across the State, the South Australian Farmers Federation conducted a two-day phone-in for farmers. The survey confirmed that farm families were suffering from significant psychological and physical problems as a result of the stress they were under. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today Mr Scholz said that recent anecdotal evidence suggests that stress levels amongst members of the farming community are likely to be extremely high again as a result of the virtual collapse of prospects because of the unseasonably wet conditions. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In many respects, this year will be much worse than a drought year . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He said that farmers:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . have been looking forward to one of the best years in many to help reduce their debt levels and claw their way back to profitability. Their hopes have been dashed and the effects of the disappointment will be enormous.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that the South Australian Farmers Federation is meeting with the Premier and his Primary Industries Minister shortly and I urge the State and Federal governments to consider and respond to any calls for assistance from rural South Australians in the face of this disaster over which they have no control. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I could not sit by and not support Senator Ferguson's remarks about the devastation to some people in the farming community at the moment because of the heavy rains at a time when the crops are ready to harvest. The same thing is happening in the north of New South Wales; there are a lot of unharvested crops. It is very good for this chamber to occasionally listen to what actually happens to people out in the wider community, especially to the farmers who make such a contribution to all our export income and all our standards of living.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, the value of their contribution to our economy is sometimes not realised by the rest of the community. Occasionally we have to think of the people who are suffering hardships out on the farms. For example, Eyre Peninsula had devastating droughts not so long ago and now the crops, which were ready to be harvested, have been devastated by rain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that people could say that that is something that the farming community has to put up with.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government said that it would require primary industry to produce good crops and plenty of export income to help all of Australia out of its problems.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) the imputation credit scheme was designed to replace the classical system of company taxation which taxed the profits of the company then taxed the dividends received by the shareholder through the provision of imputation credits. Under this system the profits were taxed twice. With the current arrangements the tax paid on profits is taken into account when the dividends are paid to the shareholder. This is of substantial benefit to most shareholders. Where the taxpayer cannot utilise the excess credits the credit is lost. This situation not only applies to low income shareholders but also tax exempt investors such as State Government authorities and some other shareholders who may be taxable but cannot use all their credits. That the Government has not fully integrated company tax with personal tax so that shareholders who could not use credits get refunds is a deliberate decision reflecting various policy trade-offs, including cost to revenue, in designing the imputation system.</PARA>
