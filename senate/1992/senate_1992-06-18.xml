<PARA>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade I have pleasure in presenting the Committee's report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia and Latin America </EMPHASIS>and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record of the public hearings held by the Committee. Last year the Senate directed the Committee to inquire into Australia's relations with the republics of Latin America. The Committee was required to investigate opportunities for greater interaction in trade, investment, economic, political, cultural and multilateral contacts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee concluded early on that it would not be possible to focus on all 22 Latin American countries equally. Hence, while relations with all Latin American countries were examined, the Committee focused on those countries where economic activities, points of common interests and trade opportunities are strongest. Particular attention was paid to relations with Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela, all of which have missions located in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it took on the task set by the Senate, the Committee was aware that it would be exploring a relationship about which little is known and even less written about. Nevertheless, it came as a surprise to Committee members to realise just how little was known or available and how massive a task it would turn out to be. I am happy to say that members of the Committee rose to the challenge. The result of 14 months of intensive work is evident in the substantial report before the Senate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this time, the Committee examined submissions from 120 individuals and organisations, including government agencies, commercial organisations, cultural bodies and representatives of Latin American diplomatic missions in Australia. It was heartening that even some individuals from Latin America made submissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee held 12 public hearings and took nearly 2,000 pages of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> evidence. With very few exceptions, all submissions, related correspondence and other material will shortly be available for reference as companion volumes to this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the inquiry the Committee received the unstinting support of Latin American diplomatic representatives in Australia. The Senate would be interested to know that four Latin American diplomats&mdash;the representatives of Chile, Colombia, Peru and Uruguay&mdash;appeared as witnesses before the Committee at public hearings. The fact that four diplomatic representatives gave evidence is unprecedented and a great honour to this Committee and, I am sure, to the Senate itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to place on record the Committee's debt of appreciation to the ambassadors of Chile, Colombia and Peru, their Excellencies Mr Juan Salazar, Mr Fernando Navas de Brigard and Mr Gonzalo Bedoya, and to Mr Julio Giambruno, the former Charge d'Affaires of Uruguay. I also place on record Committee members' thanks to their Excellencies Mr Enrique Candioti, Ambassador of Argentina, Mr Marcos Cortes, Ambassador of Brazil, and Mr Marco Requena, Ambassador of Venezuela, and Counsellor of Uruguay, Mr Roberto Tourino, for making valuable up-to-date reference material available to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee similarly appreciates the assistance of former Ambassador of Colombia, Dr Antonio Puerto, and former Ambassador of Mexico, Mr Alejandro Morales. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the staff of the Committee secretariat: the secretary, Ms Ilze Svenne, principal research officer, Kay Chee Lance, senior research officer, John O'Keefe, and executive assistant, Rachael Kelly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is of the firm view that it is in Australia's interest to seek substantial improvements in the Australian-Latin America relationship across a wide spectrum of political and cultural activities. In 1991 and 1992, the overall picture for Latin America is of growing GDP, receding inflation, decreasing public debt, higher economic growth rates and outward looking economies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recognises that a degree of caution remains. The success of Latin American political and economic reforms is not assured in some countries and both political and social problems remain in many Latin American societies. However, on balance, the Committee believes that Australia's interests would be well served by pursuing the economic opportunities that are increasingly evident in Latin America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has made 63 wide ranging recommendations addressing the practical and policy aspects of the Latin American relationship. On behalf of the Committee, I would like to commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

The report is original and well researched and I believe that it maps out new prospects for Australia's relations with the Latin American republics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very proud to say that this report would rank in the top half dozen of the 50 inquiries that I have been involved in in my time in this place. It has been a total pleasure to be involved in this inquiry with my Senate colleagues and staff. We are indebted to the family of ambassadors and other Latin American diplomatic representatives in Australia who made submissions and appeared before the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The seeds of this inquiry were sown as a result of a conversation I had in October 1990 with the first Colombian Ambassador to Australia, Dr Tony Puerto. He opened my eyes to the modernisation that was taking place in Colombia. My horizons were extended as a result of reading about and researching what was happening in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, which is our best partner in the GATT Round, and oil rich Venezuela. It was a very real sense of discovery to me personally to learn about the enormous prospects of closer economic relations between Australia and Mexico. It was exciting to find that we could have a useful task in this Senate inquiry, setting out a clear set of parameters regarding our relations with this whole region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirty years ago there was a parliamentary initiative in that the then Minister for Trade, Jack McEwen, encouraged Senator John Gorton to lead a seven member&mdash;three Liberal, three Labor and himself&mdash;parliamentary delegation to six countries in the region. Many initiatives were set out then, but I am afraid most of them were frustrated in the decade or so that followed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was happy to visit seven countries in the region a year ago. The direct contact I had with government, business and parliamentary representatives in the seven countries I visited served to inform me in my contribution to this report. I am enormously grateful to my hosts in Latin America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the half minute that remains to me, I note the 63 recommendations of this inquiry. They are all, I believe, well formulated. I refer to recommendation 14, for example, which sets a target of 3 per cent for Australia's share of trade with Latin America. At the moment it is one per cent. I believe we can move to this target of 3 per cent by the end of the decade. Recommendation 31 calls for the establishment of a task force, focusing initially on the next two years, to provide a foundation so that our relationship can live up to its full potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many recommendations relating to general education exchanges, Spanish language, people to people exchanges, immigration changes, and development of aviation and shipping. Of course, most of the recommendations relate to economics and politics. Some, such as recommendation 62, are very specific in recommending to the Australian Government that Mexico's application for membership of APEC be supported. </PARA>

<PARA>The subject matter of the report has been widely covered in the media recently. Before I go into the details of the report, I would first like to acknowledge the very hard work of the dedicated staff of the Committee secretariat. It has been an extremely difficult job to produce the report within the time requirements, particularly given that another report&mdash;a 150-page report&mdash;was prepared on prudential and safety matters only two weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In saying that, I would also like to acknowledge the role of Lynne Curran, who is leaving our secretariat and going back to the Department of the Treasury before the completion of our third report, which is due in September. I would also like to thank the printing office; it was placed under enormous pressure. I would also like the thank my colleagues on the Committee, although I have to say, regrettably, that the significant degree of unanimity we had in the last report is not reflected in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the majority report, the recommendations are contained on page 81. The majority of the Committee, including the Australian Democrats, recommend the passing of the various Bills with a range of amendments which we recommend. Most of the amendments that are recommended in the report have been well canvassed in the media and include the current matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the schedule of provisions, the improvement in superannuation benefits from 3 per cent to 9 per cent is to occur from this year to the year 2002-03. That is a two-year increase in the timetable. The 4 per cent is to apply from 1 July this year to 31 December this year. The 5 per cent is to apply from 1 January next year to 30 June next year, with one proviso, which is that the timetable can be varied by six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The payroll threshold between small business and large business was originally flagged at $500,000. It is now recommended that that go to $1m. Originally the payment of superannuation moneys was proposed to be monthly; now it is proposed that it be quarterly. It is recommended that the minimum wage contribution threshold above which superannuation money should be paid be increased from $250 a month to $450 a month with the proviso that, where existing award provisions are lower than $450 a month, that should be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Matters included in the report but not reported on widely in the media include a recommendation that a ruling be sought from the Tax Commissioner as to a definition of `employee'. There are also some recommendations with respect to some fairly minor but important technical matters: for example, that remuneration for local councillors not be covered; that there be a rewording of the way in which defined benefits apply; and also that there be a rewording of the clauses of the Bill with respect to problems where a person's income on some occasions drops below the monthly threshold and on others goes above it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A range of related announcements were made by the Government and these are important in the context of the majority report which recommends accepting the Bills. Firstly, the Government has announced acceptance of a range of regulations and safety improvements which were outlined in our report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Safeguarding Super&mdash;The Regulation of Superannuation</EMPHASIS> that was tabled only two weeks ago. It must be almost a record time for a government to respond positively to a range of recommendations and report to the Senate. Secondly, the Government has announced that the preservation age for superannuation payments should be increased to 60 by the year 2025. Thirdly, a tax package will be announced by the Treasurer. Fourthly, in terms of the wages aspect, there will be amendments to the Industrial Relations Act to ensure that the increases in superannuation are taken into account in future wage movements. Finally, it is recommended that group training companies and service organisations not be disadvantaged and that any cost increases be taken into account in terms of the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now address some of the wider issues relating to the superannuation guarantee levy. This country faces an ageing population. At the present time there are 1.9 million persons over the age of 65&mdash;11 per cent of our population. By the year 2000 that will rise to 4.1 million&mdash;some 17 per cent. By the year 2031 it will be 5.2 million&mdash;some 20 per cent of Australia's population. Currently, pensions cost 2.8 per cent of gross domestic product. By the year 2025 they will cost 4.5 per cent of gross domestic product. It was very clearly evidenced before the Committee that we need to ensure that contributions of 12 per cent are made over 40 years to ensure a decent old age pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We carried out an evaluation of the overseas experience. We surveyed some 24 countries and all but two of those countries provide for very substantial levels of compulsory contributions with respect to superannuation and social security payments. Of the two exceptions, one, New Zealand, is interesting; it has not provided for old age pensions. New Zealand is an interesting example because it is so often touted by those opposite as a country on which our public policy should be modelled. But, interestingly, only last year the new National Government in New Zealand attempted to reduce old age pensions because it simply has not been able to afford them through the Budget process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence before the Committee was overwhelming on the issue of establishing adequate levels of compulsory superannuation for pensions. There were significant differences in two areas. Significant areas of business complained about the timetable and about who should pay. But they did recognise the principle involved in compulsion and setting realistic levels. There was also opposition from a range of welfare groups&mdash;and I will go into that a little later. But without these reforms the pressures to reduce the old age pension will be enormous. There are significant sectors of the work force at the present time that are not receiving the supposedly compulsory 3 per cent contribution&mdash;some 14 per cent of the work force. That is the estimate of the Department of Industrial Relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will turn briefly to the opposition to these measures. In terms of business groups, a commitment has been given that the estimated cost of 3 to 4 per cent over the next decade will be taken into account in future wage cases. In terms of the vociferous complaints, particularly from business and, I notice, from some State Premiers, including Labor Premiers, there will not be any significant increase in unemployment resulting from these measures. The cost will be taken into account in future wage negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the complaints of some welfare groups, I would have to say that, frankly, they are misguided and lack a vision of what, potentially and catastrophically, could occur in terms of the current old age pension if we do not tackle this issue now and if we do not provide substantial levels of self-funding for those who can afford it. Thirty to 40 years hence, I would predict that, if we do not have the substantial levels of compulsory superannuation that are provided for in the legislation, the current old age pension will be reduced by future governments. That is something we must avoid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, I emphasise that, in terms of the proposals, low income earners will be substantial beneficiaries. Because of this legislation, when persons who are on 50 per cent of average weekly earnings&mdash;or about $15,000 or $16,000 a year&mdash;retire after 40 years, they will have a 31 per cent increase in retirement income over and above the current old age pension. Those persons who are on 75 per cent of average weekly earnings&mdash;about $24,000 or $25,000 a year&mdash;will have a 17 per cent increase in their retirement income. I want to put to bed this myth that low income earners are disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a progressive measure. Those persons in our society who are receiving very substantial levels of superannuation, who tend to be the higher paid, will not receive any benefit from this legislation; that is as it should be. At the same time, in terms of future wage cases, they will be expected to forgo an across-the-board 3 to 4 per cent in future wage increases. Those persons who receive little superannuation or none at all, who will receive a 6 to 9 per cent benefit from this legislation, will be expected to forgo only 3 to 4 per cent in future wage increases. It is a pretty good deal for low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to those persons who do not spend significant time in the work force&mdash;that includes, particularly, women who, for significant periods, are in many cases bearing children&mdash;it is important to emphasise that the current old age pension will be maintained. The potential will exist, because of improvements in the budgetary situation, to improve the old age pension. The only way we can improve the old age pension is to adopt the measures outlined in the legislation that has been presented to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been complaints that there should be an option of a wage increase for lower income earners. I say to those persons in the welfare community who continually advocate that option that it is simply not available in the current economic or industrial relations framework. With regard to those persons who are on very low levels of income, no more than a few hundred dollars a month, assistance can be, and has been, targeted by this Government in other ways, through the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contrast between the majority report and the principles underlying this legislation and the position that the Opposition is presenting is quite stark. The Government is proposing by the year 2002 a 12 per cent level of contributions. As I have outlined, we believe that will be adequate to fund and improve old age pensions, in order to avoid the catastrophic problems that are confronting New Zealand and the catastrophic problems that could confront this country in 30 or 40 years time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite, of course, are advocating a 5 per cent level of compulsory contributions and then they would rely on so-called tax incentives to encourage people to get to the 12 per cent threshold. All I can say is that it has not worked anywhere else in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Opposition is prescribing through its Fightback package is a recipe for disaster. In fact, it is a recipe for halving old age pensions. That would be the reality of the outcome if the Opposition's package were ever adopted. It is a recipe for halving old age pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The proposals outlined in the legislation are realistic, economically responsible and the right way for this country to go. The policy that is outlined is visionary. It is very rare for politicians to look 30 or 40 years ahead, but this policy is very long term. It overcomes a variety of public policy issues with respect to old age pensions that have been debated over the last 80 years and about which nothing has been done. It was not until the election of this Labor Government that we started to tackle the issues of the ageing population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this legislation and other matters that will be announced in the Budget session we will bed down the big picture issues affecting retirement incomes in this country. It is this Government that is presenting a realistic vision of the future.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy of the matter is that, in the midst the worst recession in 60 years and record levels of unemployment, what we are now seeing as a result of this deal done with the Australian Democrats is a package that will inevitably guarantee significant levels of unemployment. Indeed, the low and middle income earners, for whom the Government professes a great deal of concern, are the worst losers of all. As we know, this generation will have to pay twice. Those at the bottom end of the income scale will simply be forced to accept lower standards of living in order to have the privilege of disqualifying themselves from the age pension. As that message gets out over the weeks and months ahead, I cannot imagine that anyone is going to be particularly grateful to either the Government or the Australian Democrats for what is now going to be imposed on employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look for a moment at international experience, it is unique to suggest that somehow all the burden ought to be borne by employers and not by employees. This is one of the examples of gross hypocrisy that I find quite entertaining in one sense because it is so logically flawed. The Government is saying, `Look, there will not be any significant level of job losses'. Now the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) is talking about negligible losses. Senator Kernot concedes that there will be job losses. It is all a question of how much. We are not going to get any more admissions than that, but I would have thought that it is quite sufficient for the people of Australia to realise who is going to be paying the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's proposition is that there will not be any significant job losses because employees will bear the burden. How will they bear the burden? Treasury has made it perfectly clear.

That is precisely what we have put down. So there is no quarrel with us, I can assure the honourable senator. Professor Knox may well prefer a higher level of compulsion. In the industry they prefer a 20 per cent level of compulsion, but that is not the way one judges these things in the national interest. One judges them by taking a macro-economic view of the world.

Because the IRC, and I say this to Senator Kernot in particular, does not have a mandate to really look at capacity to pay&mdash;if one reads the judgment one sees this&mdash;its members did not really address that issue. They just inferentially picked up a lot of the CAI concerns and then went on to say that they shared the concern about impact on part time and casual workers and then they recommended a national conference.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy is that, if one wants a sensible and rational public debate, one will take the industrial relations component out of this.

Allow them to contribute to any complying fund, you will build up your levels and away you go'. No-one in his right mind would attempt to justify the need for award superannuation, even to the point where one can meet one's SGL obligations and still be in breach of the awards. The agenda is so naked and transparent. This is a means of ensuring that ever-increasing amounts go into industry funds and that the ACTU has something to show its members to justify the fact that its members have been leaving in droves and that they have been getting falling standards of income over the last 10 years and to somehow pretend that 40 years down the track they will be better off.

I am saying that there will be so many technological changes in bio-technology that we may well find that the cost of maintaining the elderly is actually a great deal cheaper than it is today.

Thus the debate over how best to run an economic system is not primarily an ageing discussion. In fact, the ageing of populations may have little to do with the outcome.</PARA>

I refer to the issues of vesting, preservation, double dipping, what is an acceptable target to aim for and the urgent need for extensive education so that, in the same way as we need to have an informed democracy, we need to have an informed membership of superannuation funds so that members can exercise their right over where their money ends up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee spent quite a lot of time on the issue of compulsion versus voluntarism. The overwhelming evidence was in favour of compulsion. However one looks at it, for some reason there has been a market failure in Australia. I think the reason is a combination of both political and cultural factors. As a nation we have failed to save. We do not take provision for ourselves in the long term future seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that governments have been serious enough about savings incentives. I acknowledge that the Opposition in its Fightback package plans to address that. We need to do that as well as put in place this compulsory superannuation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So one of the big issues to weigh up from the 6,000 pages of evidence is: can we afford to wait? I say to Senator Alston that we do not know with any certainty what lies ahead of us in 30 or 40 years. But do we have to wait until we get there and find out before we decide what we should have done? Of course we do not. We have to make a judgment now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having gone through the 6,000 pages of evidence of the 200 witnesses, the ultimate decision making comes down to one's fundamental view of the world, based on experience. If I had to decide on putting in place something which has a probability of working and which could minimise impact on business, I would make the judgment that we need to do something now rather than do nothing and wait for the Opposition to come into government&mdash;wait for the Opposition to give us another three or four years to find out whether what it thinks about voluntarism is right or wrong, wait for the Opposition to review that and to decide what it will do about the fact that it has not worked. In the meantime this nation would have lost the opportunity to tackle retirement incomes policy in a meaningful way for another five or six years. I decided that it was not fair for us to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations in this report will go a long way towards placing Australia on the threshold of a sound retirement income system. But it is not my preferred model. The fact of life is the Democrats do not get to impose their agenda, as they would really like it, on either the Government or the Opposition. Our policy is for a national portable superannuation scheme, along the lines, perhaps, of the Singapore model, but that was not on the table. On the table were Government and Opposition proposals. That is the way things work here. I had to make a judgment on what I think, based on the evidence, about either of those proposals. So I made a judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, as long as the increments on employers are not too onerous&mdash;and honourable senators know my concern about that; it is well documented; hence the substantial amendments to this timetable&mdash;then this SGL proposal in these Bills will succeed. I do believe that a correct balance has been struck between the national interest, business considerations and individual welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston said I had not talked to interest groups. The fact of the matter is I did talk to interest groups between the Government's response on the Sunday night and the party room making a decision on the Tuesday afternoon. Again, I had to make the difficult judgment of whether to put something in place for 90 per cent of employees in Australia and at the same time try to do something complementary for low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not approach this legislation as the beginning and end of retirement incomes policy. This is one important part. I believe that we can pursue justice for low income earners through this Bill. Despite the fact that the appendix contains details of the discussions which took place between the Government and the Democrats, not all of those have been agreed to. We have agreed to a schedule, a rate of implementation and quarterly payments. But there are many other things which are still in the negotiable phase, which interest groups need to understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can support the concerns of low income earners by attempting to gain community and parliamentary support for a flat rate instead of a percentage wage increase in any national wage case. That is an important aim that is complementary to the objectives of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I get on to the wider political context, I commend the report and draw attention to the Democrats' dissent, which represents my Party's policy on retirement incomes as well as the need to mobilise national savings for the long term benefit of all Australians. I also pay tribute to the Chair, particularly for his tolerance under extreme political aggro. I pay tribute to my colleagues. Despite our acknowledgment of the seriousness of this topic and the decision we were making for the provision of retirement income for generations of Australians from now, most of the time we conducted ourselves in an exemplary manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the secretariat for its capacity to produce another long and comprehensive report under the considerable pressure of time frames imposed upon it by political imperatives. I especially mention the printers, Mr Gordon Kimber and his staff, who toiled in what we call the dungeons till 1 o'clock this morning. That really needs to be on the record. We are grateful to them for allowing us to meet our deadline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now say a few final words in the wider political context regarding whether the Democrats have done the right thing in agreeing to the passage of these Bills.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the second report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. This particular report focuses on four Bills collectively known as the superannuation guarantee Bills. I suppose the best feature of this report is certainly the minority report produced by Senator Alston and myself, because that focuses on the problems associated with these Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before proceeding, I would like to acknowledge the very important role of the secretariat staff in assisting with this particular inquiry. It has indeed been a rush job. In being a rush job, the quality of both the first report and this report is unsurpassed, I believe, and therefore special tributes must go to the Secretary, Mr Richard Gilbert, who is present; principal research officer, Miss L. Curran, from Treasury; principal research officer, Mr Game; senior research officer, Mr Power; and executive assistant, Ms H. Hibbitt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is one unfortunate aspect of the presentation of this report today in that, before the tabling of this report, the Australian Democrats, having gained all the insight and information from this report, rushed off and did a deal with the Government. I think the timing is most unfortunate. It certainly does not assist in terms of solidarity amongst members of the Committee when certain sections of that Committee rush off, armed with inside information, to then do deals with the Government. They may have indicated that time was a problem, but given the fact that this did happen, it will not enhance the status or reputation of Senate select committees or the presentation and manner in which they present reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's position is really to impose further costs on industry by imposing a further impost on wages. The timing of such an imposition could not have been worse&mdash;in the middle of a recession. At the lowest level, the superannuation regime represents the loss of one job in 30 mathematically. With so many businesses operating at such a low level of activity and profitability, this change certainly will cost jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose one surprising feature arising from the appearance of witnesses representing the disadvantaged and the welfare groups was the total lack of consultation by Government with this important section of the community. I wish to state that all groups so represented in these categories believe that the low income earners of Australian society, certainly in the short term and as a result of this legislation, will be worse off. I think this is indeed regrettable. So there are problems with this whole regime which Senator Alston and I outlined in our extensive minority report, in that this superannuation guarantee levy is built on an inequitable foundation. Therefore it will tend to exacerbate poverty and hardship, certainly in the short term. But in the short term it will not lead to an efficient investment and it will have a definite bias towards one form of saving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think overall the Senate inquiry demonstrated how inequitable and abysmal superannuation is in Australia. Certainly, the problem with the current regime is that relatively few people will be able to get a significant superannuation benefit on retirement. The guarantee charge, which comes from an industry agenda of the ACTU, is not based on social security type considerations. I find it surprising that this should come from an Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence was overwhelming that jobs will be shed in huge numbers and that more businesses, especially small and marginal ones, will be forced to the wall. The charge will certainly have an impact in that it will deepen the recession. The levy is an attempt to make employers pick up the tab for the ageing population in Australia. Employees will not be required to make the slightest contribution. It is not until we reach something like 9 per cent that there is some suggestion that there may be some trade-off in terms of tax or that some contribution will be required from the employee. In other words, it is just another tax on an already overtaxed and overregulated nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the job shedding and the business failures that the levy will create, there will be an increasing trend towards the use of small contractors at the expense of the bulk of the Australian paid work force which operates under the PAYE system. There will be situations in which many contractors and their employees will still be outside of the scope and intentions of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Undoubtedly, the legislation will impact severely on many sections of the community. I think it is regrettable that we could not get an undertaking from Government representatives or the departments associated with welfare that they will top up Government contributions to the welfare agencies which will be caught in the net and have to pay the superannuation levy. That means that less money will be available for the essential welfare agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge Government senators to ensure that the disadvantaged and the welfare groups in Australia do not suffer any loss in terms of the real value of Government assistance as a result of the imposition of this levy. It is important that Government members especially put pressure on the Government to ensure that the real value of Government contributions to welfare groups in Australia is maintained. Certainly, it appears from the evidence given that in the short term there will be a loss of benefits to the welfare lobby as a result of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact on the States is similarly a matter of concern. Never before have I heard the States speak in such unison as they are doing in their comments against this levy. Some State parliaments which are in recess at the moment will have to enact retrospective legislation to cover certain types of schemes. I think this is unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's stated intention is to reduce the massive social security pay-out which it has itself created. Mr Dawkins says that self-provision will mean an increase in the flexibility of the Government's Budget in future years, especially as our population ages. But, in a sense, that is not really a true statement. This provision is required to be made by the employers. The compulsory 3 per cent levy that has been written into awards in the industrial arena was not based on productivity increases and was not off-set against wage increases&mdash;it was a further cost imposition. The superannuation levy will make Australian industry much less competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The training guarantee levy and the superannuation guarantee levy are two recent examples of government imposed costs on business. Surprisingly, the new sales tax simplification arrangements will impose further costs on business and make business less and less competitive. The Liberal-National coalition's Fightback proposal is centred on creating more jobs. Certainly, the bias might be one of taking costs off business. But in doing this, we will reduce the level of unemployment. We will increase the number of people who are engaged in productive full time work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Fightback, we will reduce very significantly the taxes that apply to individuals&mdash;in terms of individual tax rates and the tax threshold at which people begin to pay tax. But most importantly, we will be taking off business those additional costs that this Government and other governments have imposed&mdash;costs that have made businesses uncompetitive and not able to compete on world markets. We now have a situation in which there is massive unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But even in the face of massive costs to business, the Government will save very little because there has been no attempt to address the problem of double dipping which allows retirees to spend their superannuation entitlement and then apply for the pension. So, maybe, people are being denied wage increases at a time when they most need the money. Low income earners in particular need money at a time when they are struggling to buy their homes and educate their children. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> People will certainly give priority to assisting their children&mdash;to giving them the best possible education. But if they are to be denied an adequate income or security of employment, they will not be in as strong a position to give their children a sound education and security. So the long term implications mean that this is not `clever type country' legislation. People will make some sacrifice now to get some sort of benefit. People in their fifties will be encouraged to take a trip around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do people really want to do? I guarantee that the majority of Australians would prefer to have that money so that they can educate their children at a critical time of their life. This is particularly the case with low income earners. The problem with this legislation is that it will enable retirees to spend their superannuation and then apply for the pension. So the timing of this legislation in terms of its introduction and its implementation could not have been worse. I think it is incumbent on the Government to improve the benefits that will accrue from the superannuation guarantee charge and to find a system under which double dipping will be stopped and eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the contributions that will be made by employers on behalf of people on the lowest incomes will be swallowed up in administration and other costs. Some of these costs are quite outrageous. I must draw attention to the fact that the taxation system in terms of the contribution levy and earnings is somewhat confused. The treatment of tax is not equitable across the board. The tax treatment in respect of an employee entering one fund may not be equivalent to that in another fund. I think it is important that the Government address this issue. Certainly, I will be bringing this to the Committee's attention when it is considering its third report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasury estimates in relation to the level of savings are also flawed. This was the subject of some heated debate between Treasury officials, particularly Mr Cole who was clawed in at the last minute and obviously had not had time to read some of the answers that were given by other members of Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimates are flawed on the basis of failing to recognise the amount of time that families spend outside the work force, and in terms of the lump sum $30,000 dissipation level, because it will be substantially higher. In fact, I think it is incumbent on Treasury to provide this Parliament with a lot more information to establish the link between savings and the superannuation guarantee levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the analysis fairly closely, we find that it is not until the end of the scheme, towards the year 2000, that there is any significant level in terms of the overall impact on savings. Certainly, it will channel some types of funds into certain activities. But this raises the question of the national interest and the availability of those moneys, particularly to small business, and particularly to those small businesses that are struggling and could well be pushed over the brink. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give some examples of job shedding in terms of evidence given to the Committee. David Jones (Australia) Pty Ltd, employing 100,000 people, said that in the event of a 2 per cent increase in costs it would have no choice but to reduce employee numbers. That sort of sentiment was also expressed by the Coles-Myer Group. So if we are talking about 3 per cent, increasing to 12 per cent, it does not take a mathematical genius to work out that that represents 1,200 jobs with one company over the eight years specified for the implementation of the levy. There is no doubt that this is representative of the impact nationwide. There will be a massive increase in terms of job shedding. The Confederation of Australian Industry has estimated that the effect of the levy will be to put at risk between 45,000 and 60,000 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government continually talks about the economy's capacity to pay. I put this to you, Mr Acting Deputy President: what about individual businesses' capacity to pay, and individuals' capacity to employ people, especially in these stringent times when it is necessary to employ more people, not fewer?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is concerned, in opposing this legislation, about the whole Australian economy, particularly the employment generating sector&mdash;small business. Again, I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that Fightback has a different approach. It is designed to increase employment. It is designed to reduce substantially those numbers that are unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned that double dipping will continue, and at certain levels the scheme will cost more than it will save. That is probably why Treasury has not been able to analyse it, or perhaps it is because Treasury has been too busy analysing Fightback. But at least the Fightback proposal has positive elements&mdash;something which is lacking in this legislation which is the subject of evaluation by this Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is unfortunate that the Government did not wait until this Senate Select Committee report on superannuation was completed so that at least it could have had the overall picture. It would have been better if this legislation&mdash;the four superannuation guarantee Bills that will be before the Senate shortly&mdash;could have been examined in a better, less pressured atmosphere in the Budget session of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the reason for the rush is that the Government knows its time is running out. Its accord with the ACTU and the imperatives of the 1993 election require the scheme to be in place urgently. But the scheme represents another tax on a population heavily burdened by taxation and regulation. The Government is providing the coalition with the opportunity to say to the nation that there will now be eight taxes which it will have to remove, instead of the seven outlined in Fightback. I look forward to the continued debate when the Bills come before the Parliament. I hope there will be substantive amendments to the Bills as proposed, arising from this very important inquiry on superannuation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to congratulate the members of the Committee. It was one of those committees dealing with legislation in which each of the parties had a distinctly different view. It is always very difficult to deal with matters in such a situation. I think the Committee behaved very well under those circumstances. I must disagree with Senator Watson, however, by pointing out that he is confusing the role of an ordinary select committee dealing with an issue and a select committee dealing with legislation. Because of its very nature, a committee dealing with legislation, working against a timetable, cannot do some of the things that an ordinary select committee with unlimited time would do. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer very briefly to a couple of things that Senator Watson said. I note that the Whip is looking at me so I will be very brief. Senator Watson talked about double dipping. The double dipping issue has not yet been proved. It cannot be asserted that people are going on world trips and doing other things. I believe there is a certain urban myth that the Opposition has picked up in this regard. There is not yet any proof. I believe it is possible that that could happen, but it is also true that the vast majority of people facing retirement use their money in a sensible way. Sometimes that sensible way is to pay off part of their house mortgage or to buy their house. At other times it is to convert that lump sump payment into an annuity. There are a number of things that can happen. The truth is that the jury is still out. I would prefer to wait for the inquiry that the Department of Social Security is making so that we can have real facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the problem with the Opposition. The Opposition and employers are always against change and are always against progress. In this particular case the employers' organisations all said when award superannuation came in that the time was not right and that we should wait until legislation came in. When legislation has come in, the employers have opposed it. The Opposition, of course, as their voice, has also opposed it.  Those are the simple facts and that is the situation we face.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating cognately seven Bills relating to the great coal industry in Australia. I would like to echo the views of a colleague of mine in the other place. Mr Fischer, the honourable member for Farrer and shadow Minister for Resources, made the point that it really is an appalling situation that debate on seven amending Bills relating to the coal industry is limited because of the guillotine. The fact that this debate is being limited within the Senate to one hour shows the lack of interest of this Government in export industries and employment in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coal is an export orientated industry without which, quite frankly, Australia would be bankrupt. I cannot put that in plainer terms; it is something that our friends the Australian Democrats should take on board. It is an industry with which I am proud to have been associated for over 20 years. It is also an industry in which just about everyone knows everyone else. It has been my pleasure to count as friends a broad spectrum of people in the industry, whether they be gardeners, bulldozer drivers, engineers&mdash;civil, electrical, mining and mechanical&mdash;geologists or union officials. In fact, at some time in the future a tribute must be paid to some of the great pioneers of this wonderful industry. They are a great bunch who historically have been under attack by people such as Mr Whitlam and the renowned R.F.X. Connor of the Labor Government of the 1970s and, more recently, by the lunatic fringe dwellers in the Green movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coal is an essential ingredient throughout the world in electricity generation and in the production of steel, cement and chemicals. As a component in the generation of electricity, it is indirectly involved in the production of aluminium and other products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coal industry is not commonly understood. There are some 50 or more varieties of coal. Broadly, coal can be divided into two categories: coking and steaming. Australia mines some 160 million tonnes of coal per annum and exports around 120 million tonnes, which is worth in excess of $6 billion&mdash;$6,000m&mdash;to the Australian economy. Coal is our largest single export earner.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, we must keep this contribution in perspective. Compared with the United States and China, the production from our mines pales into insignificance. According to figures that I saw some years ago, the United States mines approximately 800 million tonnes of coal per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently met with mainland China's vice-Minister for coal. He advised me that mainland China currently mines 1,000 million tonnes of coal, which satisfies 75 per cent of that country's electricity generation requirements. Because of the increased demand for electricity in China, it is planned to increase the production of coal in China to 1.4 billion tonnes per annum over the next few years. Honourable senators should compare that with Australia's total coal production of 160 million tonnes per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats, particularly Senator Coulter, and Mrs Kelly give the impression that the world relies on Australia for its supply of coking and steaming coal. This was the same crazy notion held by the Whitlam Government in the 1970s, led by the mentor of the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the late Mr R.F.X. Connor. Mr Connor went down the resource diplomacy path, ruthlessly bucketing both the Americans who had invested here and the major Japanese buyers. Looking back, I say without equivocation that that stupidity might have won a few political nationalistic brownie points at the time but it cost this country dearly&mdash;it cost us thousands of millions in export dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could not help but notice a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of a week or so ago, which stated that the current Prime Minister urged his troops `to get angry'. In a passionate speech to the Labor Caucus, Mr Keating told his members of parliament that the first lesson he learnt from his mentor, Mr Rex Connor, when he entered politics was always to remember that `we hate the Liberals'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Connor, whom I met on many occasions, could be best described as hating just about everybody. I do not recall him ever publicly saying a kind word about anyone in those few years that he was in power and did so much damage to a growing industry. In fact, looking back, I would have to say that he was a sad figure who made a lot of noise, insulted a lot of decent people, achieved nothing and was ultimately dismissed by Prime Minister Whitlam for his role in the infamous Khemlani affair. Some mentor!&mdash;although the attraction of one for the other is understandable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the Bills. The purpose of the Coal Industry Amendment Bill 1992 is to amend the Coal Industry Act 1946 and to reform the powers and functions of the Joint Coal Board. This is a step in the right direction. Therefore, we will not oppose it, although we will be moving a second reading amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition agrees with the recommendations of the Industry Commission that the continued existence of the Joint Coal Board is not justified, and we will move to abolish the board when we are in government. The board is anachronistic in every sense of the word. It was set up in 1946 by the Minister for Postwar Reconstruction to control the New South Wales coal industry. The major reason for this was the actions of militant trade union leaders who had no hesitation in pulling on strikes willy-nilly, notwithstanding the grim war situation between 1941 and 1945. This was not a great success, as evidenced by Prime Minister Ben Chifley putting troops in to operate the coal mines in 1949. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coal industry is steeped in tradition, with the miners union having a vested interest in perpetuating a false `them and us' position. Thankfully, in recent years, with more enlightened leadership&mdash;mainly from John Maitland&mdash;there is more of an awareness that the Australian coal mines are competing with the rest of the world and that the future of the coal industry depends on real increases in productivity. Regrettably, I must say that although in the last couple of years we have had something like a 2 or 3 per cent increase in productivity within the coal mines&mdash;certainly in New South Wales&mdash;wage increases have been of the order of 9 per cent. This is unsustainable for an industry that is relying on exports markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Coal Board is a hangover from the past. There have been attempts&mdash;from memory, as far back as 1976&mdash;to remove the board. I do not know why it continues. This Bill certainly reduces its duties. The board was introduced at a time when there was really only one coal producer in Australia, and that was New South Wales. If one looks at the terms of reference of the board, one will see that it talks about maintaining adequate coal supplies for Australia and the world. In those days, there were no real coal mines in Queensland or even in Western Australia. I was heavily involved in the growth of the coal mines in the Bowen Basin. These mines have had a great impact since the late 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the Coal Research Assistance Amendment Bill 1992, which the Opposition's supports, is to transfer coal research and development from a government run system to an industry funded and managed scheme. Australia is in a fortunate position in respect of its coal deposits. That is the key thing. Time and again we are told that a particular Australian industry is the most efficient industry in the world. How many times do we all hear that said about a particular industry, whether it be coal, sugar or anything else?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the case, one has to question why we have this balance of payments deficit that grows bigger and bigger year in and year out. The point that I make is that in many instances, as with the coal industry, we are blessed with having one of the best deposits in the world, but not necessarily the most efficient industry in the world. I do not say that with any sense of malice. It is simply to draw people's attention to the fact that we could become much more efficient if permitted to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> But the growth of the industry depends on the use of latest technologies and on ongoing research. If this industry is to develop, that is a must. The sharing of information gained by companies is a feature of the coal industry. Even though on the export market these companies are competitive, they are only too happy to share information on new developments and programs with each other. I think that is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other day in here I heard Senator Coulter from the Australian Democrats actually arguing that we should reduce the amount of research that we undertake on coal. Here is our greatest export industry, one that has the potential for growth and where the demand appears to be continuing, and we have people such as Senator Coulter saying, `Cut back on research'. I hope that he reads the information that I gave earlier about where Australia was going and how we fit into the total world scene&mdash;we account for 160 million tonnes of production compared with the United States at 800 million and China at 1 billion and growing to 1.4 billion. So let us keep it in perspective. We do not have a monopoly on world supplies of coal; nowhere near it. In fact, our exports are about 10 per cent of the total of American coal production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Mrs Kelly, in her profound announcements, made it perfectly clear that she did not know the difference between sulphur and carbon. One of the good things about Australian coal is that it happens to be low in sulphur compared with Northern Hemisphere coals. She said that it is great because we will not really have any effect on pollution because we have coal that will not contribute to the greenhouse effect. She did not really know the difference between sulphur and carbon. To have an environment Minister who does not know the difference between sulphur and carbon is outrageous&mdash;it makes you worry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer people such as Mrs Kelly and Senator Coulter to today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> in which there is an excellent article by Julie Lambert in Tokyo about where our coal industry is going and what the Japanese are doing. Senator Coulter was in here some weeks ago complaining about the Japanese and their handling of the environment. I asked him whether he had been to Japan and he said no and that he did not intend to go there&mdash;which is a nice open mind from someone who purports to lead a political party in Australia! I suggested that if he went to Japan he would see that substantial improvements have occurred in Japan over the last few years. I just draw his attention to one particular paragraph in Julie Lambert's article which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A world leader in clean coal technology, Japan records substantial exports to other advanced countries of equipment to remove sulphur and nitrogen oxides from coal emissions.</PARA>
<PARA>The technical words used are `Nox' for nitrogen oxide and `Sox' for sulphur oxides. It also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Gasification, involving the use of coal-derived hydrogen, is expected to form the core of coal-fired power systems in the next century.</PARA>
<PARA>So the article the goes on. I will not go into any more detail on it. It is absolutely vital that coal research continue. Australian companies in the coal industry have a good record. In fact, they have basically funded it through the 5c a tonne levy. That will continue but, instead of bureaucrats determining where those funds go, it will now be determined by the industry itself, and we support that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There are four Bills involved with the long service leave amendments. These Bills change the method of funding long service leave from a rate per tonne basis to a percentage of payroll. Quite clearly, the former method was inequitable in that the capital intensive open cut operations were funding the long service leave of the labour intensive underground mines. Notwithstanding the levy, which raised about $32m a year, the current fund is underfunded to the tune of about $300m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People forget that long service leave in the coal industry falls due every eight years. It was a give-away at a time of some affluence in Australia, like a lot of these work practices that are now being addressed in a range of industries. When we add to that the wage rates, which are by far the highest in Australia, the figure becomes a fairly high impost, which now falls back on the underground mines. But that is where it should be and, even though it is a step in the right direction and one that we will not oppose, I have to say that it is absolutely ridiculous that one of the better industries in Australia has a centralised system of determining long service leave when long service leave should be paid by the companies who employ the people who work for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I comment briefly on comments made in the other place by Mr Peter Morris, the Labor member for Shortland. The only reason I want to comment is that remarks continue to be made about the coal industry which would indicate that the people making them either live in the last century in the days of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">How Green Was My Valley</EMPHASIS> or they have a vested political interest in pursuing the idea of a them and us situation, not recognising the fact that we have a highly technological industry. No longer do people crawl in little caverns with picks and shovels. We have long-wall miners, underground mines, open cut mines, drag lines, trucks and shovels and so on. So it is a sophisticated industry. Mr Morris made some remarks with regard to marketing. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As long as we have in this country a disorganised, fragmented selling basis, as we now have, and as long as our largest customer&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he did not say whom, but everyone knows that our largest customer is Japan&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">who buys over 50 per cent of our coal&mdash;is buying on an organised, highly regimented buying basis, we will be exploited. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of language one expects to hear from Third World countries. It is utterly wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was involved in the marketing of coal to Japan for something like 15 years. The facts are that the prices obtained by people in the coal market are market prices&mdash;the market determines the price. This business of whether there is a fragmented selling basis is nonsense. If it were true, why is it that every coal company in Australia, if given the choice, would prefer to sell its coal to Japan? The reason is that they get the best prices in Japan. They also get ships turning up on a regular basis, and, once you have made that long term arrangement, that relationship, with the Japanese, it is one that both can trust and it is to the benefit of both parties. This notion is a phoney thing that was spread around back in the 1970s by the then Minister, Mr Connor, whom I referred to earlier, and it did us a lot of damage because it forced the Japanese to diversify some of their markets into Canada because they were worried about this so-called resource diplomacy at that time. Mr Morris also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Australian producer competes against Australian producer to the benefit of external purchaser.</PARA>
<PARA>That is another phoney myth. He further talks about mines that shut down. Mines shut down; they will always shut down. Whether it is coal, iron ore, or anything else that is being mined, it is a definable resource. The continuation of a mine depends on the cost of recovering that resource. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That cost can be affected by a number of things. It can be affected by work practices. It can be affected by government charges. They are by far the most damaging because they are charges over which producers have no control. The cost can be affected by the market. It can also be affected by the exchange rates. A range of things can affect the continued operation or closure of a mine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see Mr Morris running down this track and saying that the reason these things shut down from time to time is the `rip it out and sell it to the first bidder' approach. That is a slur on people who are marketing around the world. There are good marketers in Australia. They are as good as anywhere in the world, and they are out to maximise their price. Mr Morris talks about the greed of companies. I have yet to see a company that did not take a long term view with any of its resources. It will balance off its cheaper mine operations with its more expensive ones to prolong the life of the mine. It is in the interests of the companies to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only time I ever saw high-grading come into a mining operation was when we had the silly former Prime Minister go over to Western Australia and say, `In two years time we are going to introduce a gold tax'. That gave producers a two-year notice to go out and high-grade. That is not normal. It is a very abnormal situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The predictions made, for instance, in the early 1970s by the Labor Party that the nasty multinationals&mdash;one does not hear that word much these days&mdash;were going to rip the best of it out, clear out and leave the worst to Australia have not been fulfilled. The mines that it predicted would have five- and 10-year lives are there after 20-odd years and probably have another 20-odd years to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a subject on which we could have a grand debate. It is a great industry. It is our biggest export industry. It is a great pity that debate is limited because this Government saw fit to bring in a range of Bills at the last moment and put a guillotine on us. It put a guillotine on the House of Representatives and we are also subject to a one-hour guillotine in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude, because I know a few of my colleagues who come from coalmining areas would like to say a few words on this matter. In relation to the Coal Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill 1992, I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Bill and related Bills because they have a particular relevance to the industry at the heart of my own area, the city of Newcastle and the Hunter Valley. The Senate is fortunate to have Senator Parer speak on this Bill. He is our shadow Minister and before coming to the Senate was one of the leaders in the coal industry in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, I would like to give a Hunter perspective. The Hunter produces approximately 70 per cent of the output of coal in New South Wales. Coal is overwhelmingly the dominant export that goes through the port of Newcastle. More than 90 per cent of the tonnage that goes through Newcastle is coal. It is easy to see, therefore, the importance that coal has to our Hunter region. It is also easy to see that changes to the coal industry will have a profound effect on the lifestyle of many people in the Hunter who depend on this industry for a living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coal is Australia's biggest export earner&mdash;$9 billion per year. The industry has the potential for even more if we can legislate properly so that the infrastructure of the industry is in place to allow it to give more. There are plenty of opportunities for further export dollars, but we have to ensure that this industry increases its competitiveness and that it stays highly competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, our wage costs are growing at twice the rate of productivity in the industry and our production is not growing nearly as fast as that of our major competitors. With the right economic conditions and incentives, new coalmines could be developed across New South Wales, particularly in the Hunter Valley and the Gunnedah areas. This would contribute enormously to our export potential and ultimately be of benefit to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Costs have to be kept to an absolute minimum. Some of the measures in these Bills before the Senate contribute to keeping costs as low as possible. Some of the measures do not go far enough in circumstances that can only be described as typical of this Government, a government that has run out of steam and lacks vision to carry out the reforms that are necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Government is to be congratulated on repealing the coal export duty in accordance with the coalition's Fightback policy. The coal export duty was imposed in the mid-1970s to take profits from the coal exporters in the wake of the oil price shocks. This can no longer be justified. It has distorted investment decisions in the coal industry and acted as a tax on exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another measure that is contained in these Bills is the reform of the Joint Coal Board. This is an example of a measure where the Government simply does not go far enough. When the Joint Coal Board was set up in 1946 it was to ensure that the coal produced in New South Wales was in such quantities that it could meet the trade and domestic demands of the nation. It was also set up to promote the welfare of the workers in the industry. Extensive powers were given to this particular body. As Senator Parer mentioned, it was established after World War II. Obviously, the industry has undergone dramatic changes since that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Coal Board is the classic example of a quango that has long outlived its usefulness to the industry. The Bill before the Senate reforms the Joint Coal Board, but keeps it in existence to perform four tasks that could be easily performed more efficiently by other government instrumentalities already in existence, or better still by the private sector. These functions are to administer the coal industry workers compensation scheme, the coalminers occupational health and rehabilitation service; to collect and collate accident and industry statistics; and to undertake coal promotion and market development activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition believes that the board should be abolished. The Industry Commission agrees. The Commission concludes in its examination of the JCB:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the perceived uniqueness of the Australian Coal Industry has meant that it has become subject to a wide range of government inventions. Many of them have no counterparts in other industries. The Commission considers there is little evidence to suggest that the extra degree of regulation is successful. The removal of all impediments, including unnecessary regulations is essential to allow the industry to become more efficient and internationally competitive.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission's conclusion largely agrees with that of the Australian Coal Association and the New South Wales Coal Association. Thus it can be clearly seen that the Government has failed to take the decisions necessary to put the coal industry firmly on the path to economic recovery so that it can achieve its potential. If it had done what was necessary it would have completely abolished the Joint Coal Board and distributed its functions to other government instrumentalities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the very brief time available, I have been able to point out that once again the Government has failed. It has undertaken half hearted reform. It has adopted some of the Opposition's Fightback package. But this lack of decisiveness is a sign of a government that is on its last legs. It is unfortunate that in this case the people who suffer most from this fault of the Government are the people of my region, the people of Newcastle and the Hunter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Bill 1992 and related Bills. In the very short time available under the guillotine, I wish to make some brief comments about an industry that is very important to my State of Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the amendments moved by the Opposition and express concern as to the effect of those aspects of this legislation that deal with long service leave in the coalmining industry. It is of concern to me that as a bottom line the Griffin Coal Mining Co. of Western Australia will be required to pay an additional $400,000 on top of the $500,000 it already pays by way of this levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know how long this Government can go on putting additional costs onto the private sector at the expense of jobs. It is not in the long term interests of the Australian economy and ultimately of its employees that this Government continually formulates legislation that raises business costs. Businesses cannot cope with it any longer and therein lies the difference between what this Government is doing and what we as a coalition are proposing in our <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document. We are taking $20m of costs off business and this Government, through almost every piece of legislation that we are seeing come before us now, is putting costs on business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have before me a media release from the New South Wales Coal Association, dated 17 June 1992, which quite clearly says that the impact of the superannuation guarantee levy on the coal industry in New South Wales will cost it another $17m per annum. How much further can we go? Extra costs are all the more unwelcome when businesses are to be slugged by the Labor and Democrats superannuation levy that was revealed yesterday. It cannot be allowed to continue. We should recall that this kind of levy arrangement does not exist for other aspects of mining such as the iron ore industry. I might add that I am not advocating that it should. We no longer live in the 1940s and I do not consider that there is any case for the general regulation of the coal industry by this Parliament. I wish that this Parliament and this Government would get out of dabbling in business instead of constantly getting into it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that it is being parochial to raise the point that since 1984-85 the Griffin Coal Mining Co. has contributed $1m more than it has drawn from the fund, and can claim with some justice that it will be further called upon to subsidise arrangements in the New South Wales coal industry. The extension of the definition of `eligible employees' in referring to the operations of the mine `wherever they are carried out' is going to bring head office as well as the mine site employees into the provisions of the legislation and thus increase the costs to the company. I fail to be convinced as to the need for any kind of centralised corporation to administer long service leave, as the principle should hold good as far as possible that individual companies should be responsible for the employment conditions of their own work force. There is no guarantee that the voice of the coal industry in Western Australia will be effectively heard&mdash;and this Government is making sure that that is so. We can with confidence look forward to a new and different approach to industrial relations from the next Liberal-National Party government, under which enterprises and their employees will have the freedom of choice to determine rewards and conditions of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Underground coalmining operations such as we have in Western Australia will be at a cost disadvantage through the levy compared with, for example, major Queensland producers where the use of draglines reduces the need for work force numbers. Has this Government taken that into consideration? I doubt it. Does it care? I know it does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact that, under these centralised arrangements for the administration of long service leave in the coal industry, all companies will, in effect, be paying according to the most generous long service leave arrangements that pertain to the industry. Now that head office employees entitled to long service leave after 15 years are included with mine site employees, whose leave is due after eight years, a levy per employee is simply not equitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely no incentive for any individual company to negotiate with its work force for some possible reduction in generous long service leave provisions&mdash;reductions that may be acceptable to the individual work forces as part of general agreements. It is this kind of centralised arrangement, casually put forward by this Labor Government, that spokes the wheels of moves towards real enterprise agreements. The Government puts it forward so casually, hoping to high heaven that the industry itself will not notice, and that the particular sections of the industry that are more seriously affected than others will not take a keen interest. That is not so. The industry is particularly concerned about the impact of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employees as well as employers will be the winners when a new industrial relations system replaces the current higgledy-piggledy, anomalous system that we have, which has constantly been put forward by Senator Cook, the `Minister for unemployment'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a great deal I would like to say about the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. It is a large Bill and it contains changes of importance for the veterans' community. Yet today I can reasonably take only 10 minutes to address the issues raised by it. While the Opposition will be supporting the Bill, it is an absolute disgrace that, both here in the Senate and last month in the House of Representatives, debate on this legislation has been restricted to what will be an effective sum total of 10 minutes in each chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government should be condemned in the strongest possible terms for its complete failure to properly manage its legislative program. The Democrats should be equally condemned. Every time they support the Government in guillotining legislation, they further undermine what little credibility they still possess. Veterans and war widows will judge for themselves the actions of the Government and the Democrats in restricting debate on these matters of concern to veterans. They should ask themselves whether it is a reflection of the attitude of the Government and of the Democrats to our veterans and war widows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the inevitable consequences of rushing through legislation in this way is that the Government, in the next session, will try to correct its mistakes. Indeed, in the Bill before us there is an important provision correcting what the Government says is a mistake in legislation it rushed through at the end of 1990. This Bill will allow certain defence personnel, who revoked their entitlements to benefits under the Defence Service Homes Act in favour of benefits under the new housing scheme, to withdraw their revocation and regain eligibility under the Defence Service Homes Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This provision has been introduced in response to the Government belatedly accepting an AAT decision that a service couple, each with an entitlement to a subsidised housing loan, may pool their entitlements for the same home. The Government claimed that this was due to a drafting error in earlier legislation which opened a loophole. The Government did not announce its acceptance of pooling until just before the end of the period last year in which those with a DSH entitlement were allowed the option of revoking their entitlement and taking up one under the new defence housing assistance scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, many who revoked their DSH entitlement did so in the belief that they could not combine their entitlements under the old scheme. It was only the persistence of the Opposition that finally forced the Government to recognise its obligations to service couples. I should say for the record that, in the end, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs took a unilateral decision on this after he found no support from the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney). It is disgraceful that the Minister of State appointed to oversee the conditions of service for our service personnel was so unwilling to recognise their rights with respect to defence service housing loans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arrangements introduced in the present Bill represent an added administrative burden that the Government should have avoided by more quickly accepting that pooling of DSH entitlements is possible under the Act. A very important provision in the Bill is to allow Australian Defence Force personnel serving in Cambodia, as part of the United Nations peacekeeping effort, access to repatriation benefits, including the service pension, and disability and death compensation, at the more generous standard of proof. The amendment will commence on 20 October 1991, since this was the date on the advice of the Department of Defence that ADF personnel first served in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At some point&mdash;probably the UN ceasefire&mdash;service in Cambodia will become peacekeeping service. Such service allows access to disability and death compensation at the more generous standard of proof, but does not allow access to service pensions and associated benefits. This Bill also provides that Army Reservists, if they are called on to serve in Cambodia, will be entitled to the same benefits as those available to full time members of the regular defence forces. In this context, yesterday in the Senate, the Opposition successfully moved an amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992, ensuring that Parliament, and not the Government, will decide when Cambodia is no longer an operational area for the purpose of the tax treatment of allowances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also remarked yesterday that events in Cambodia are very fluid. Recent developments, where the Khmer Rouge have been refusing to meet their obligations under the UN peace plan, are cause for great concern. The climate in Cambodia is not stable and, while our troops are perfectly able to meet the demands placed on them, they must be reassured that benefits which are rightly due to them, like the tax exemption, will be continued until Cambodia is made safe, not just until there is some artificially declared ceasefire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other important provisions in the Bill which the coalition supports include changes from a telephone voucher to a telephone allowance and increased telephone concessions for World War I veterans. There are also beneficial changes to the assets test for veterans who are farmers and for veterans who may wish to enter into sale lease-back arrangements on their homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude by commenting on two further changes contained in the Bill. The first is the removal of the statutory age limit of 65 years for part time members of the Veterans' Review Board. The removal is not being extended, however, to full time members. An important element of the Fightback plan is the end of compulsory retirement. Compulsory retirement is a waste of valuable human resources and reduces individual self-fulfilment. It seems that the removal of the statutory age limit is not being extended to full time members of the VRB because Cabinet so far has only given approval for the removal of the limit for part time statutory positions. Cabinet certainly has no excuse not to act decisively on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Expectations for Life</EMPHASIS>,<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> </EMPHASIS>presented to the Parliament in April, two important recommendations regarding compulsory retirement are made. The first is that the Commonwealth Government abolish compulsory age-related retirement in the Public Service and other Commonwealth employment areas. The second is that the Minister for Industrial Relations review industrial relations Acts and awards so that discrimination based on age is removed, and so that more flexible working arrangements are possible. The coalition strongly endorses these recommendations and calls on the Government to do the same and to implement them as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final provision I would like to comment on is the change aimed at streamlining the process for some applications for war widows pensions. Despite automatic entitlement to a war widows/widowers pension and funeral benefits on the death of a veteran in certain circumstances, formal lodgment and determination of applications has been necessary. This will no longer be required. This is a very straightforward amendment for which many war widows will be grateful. It is surprising that it has taken so long for the amendment to be made. While any improvement to the claim system should be supported, I believe that this is a token measure and that it does not go to the heart of the problems with the determining system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This weekend I am going to Western Australia to address the Western Australian RSL State Congress. In that State, the real problems with the determining system are starkly highlighted by the fact that in 1990-91 the Veterans' Review Board overturned a massive 72 per cent of the Repatriation Commission's disability assessment decisions. The Government concedes that the real problems lie at the first level of the claims system, but it is doing nothing of substance to deal with these problems. Veterans and war widows everywhere are rightly concerned at the inefficiencies, the legalities and the adversarial nature of the present claim system. They know that change is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was outlined in the Fightback proposals last November, the coalition intends to take positive action to fix these problems, with a central change being to include ex-service input into the decision-making progress at the first level. This will be done by establishing two-member claims panels to consider claims, with one of the members being a nominee of the ex-service community. I believe that the benefits of this system will be a closer working relationship between Government and veterans, with ex-service involvement at the first level of the determining system; increased flexibility and timeliness at the first level, with claims being decided closer to where the veteran lives; and the likelihood of a decrease in the number of appeals over and above the natural decline due to greater veteran satisfaction and confidence with a more transparently equitable system. There will also be a reduction in legal and bureaucratic costs. Of course, the coalition intends to be in constant consultation with veterans' organisations to ensure that the changes are made in the most sensible and timely manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude by reaffirming the coalition's support for the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. For once it appears that legislation is being passed where the Government is not seeking to erode veterans' entitlements. I regret that I do not have more time to spend on the substance of the Bill, but we have the Government and the Democrats, and their guillotine, to thank for that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall begin where Senator Newman left off, with regard to the limited time we have today. We would have had a lot more time for this Bill if the Liberal Party had not spent day after day on the Appropriations and if we had not had so many other interruptions to the program&mdash;in particular, the habit Liberal senators now have of moving to take note of Ministers' answers after Question Time, which does not extend beyond the half an hour that seems reasonable but which goes into the hour and the next hour. Indeed, on some occasions we have had 2 1/2 hours of taking note of Ministers' answers, which is a lot more time than we unfortunately have for this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see another hole in Senator Newman's argument, and that is the fact that she, like the Democrats, has no problem with this Bill. Of course we could sit in here for another two or three hours debating ad nauseam a Bill that we have no problems with, but that hardly seems logical. For once it does not&mdash;and I commend the Government for this&mdash;erode veterans' entitlements. This is actually a very positive Bill. Indeed, I have had no complaints whatsoever from the veteran community and no requests for amendments, and certainly no requests in any way to hold up this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to go on to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill and the Social Security (Family Payment) Amendment Bill and the number of policy changes that they implement. I would like to make a few general comments before I look at what is in the Bills. Firstly, the way in which the Government continues to amend the Social Security Act is of great concern to the Democrats. There have now been several major pieces of legislation amending the so-called plain English version of the Social Security Act, but no consolidation of the Act has been printed by the Australian Government Publishing Service since the Act was actually rewritten in 1991. Therefore, the Act is now virtually inaccessible to the Department's clients and their advocates and, I might add, it is pretty clear that some departmental officers now have considerable difficulty finding their way through it. Looking at what we have today, the drafters are also having trouble with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, without access to specialised services, it is very difficult for people to figure out what their entitlements are, know exactly what they want when they go in and be able to get what they are entitled to. This highlights why it is so important for the Government to fund the welfare rights centres across Australia. Obviously, it defeats the intent and purpose of the plain English version of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, social security Bills since 1991 have contained a large number of technical amendments to the schedules, frequently without any accompanying explanation, either in the explanatory notes or the second reading speeches. The Democrats also find this unacceptable. We suggest to the Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett) that this practice should cease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill before us now there are over 70 amendments, most of them to schedules, which have a retrospective effect. This is clearly not acceptable. An awful lot of these amendments are needed to correct previous drafting errors or oversights. However, some are substantive. The element of retrospectivity is highly undesirable and causes further confusion to the Department's clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, what we have now is a social security area that is a legislative nightmare and a legislative mess. I am not saying that it is an easy mess to amend or clarify, but even so I do not accept, and I do not believe that other senators should accept, the drafting sloppiness and inaccuracies as an excuse for retrospective amendments. There is a way out of this mess. I ask the Minister whether he is willing to consider two measures: firstly, that the Australian Government Publishing Service should consolidate the Social Security Act annually and, secondly, that the Department should agree that there will be only two start-up dates each year. We suggest, for example, 1 July and 1 February, but it would be up to the Department to look at what is more administratively convenient. This would reduce confusion, eliminate the need for retrospectivity and improve access to, and understanding of, the Act. I strongly urge the Minister to take action to remedy the present unacceptable situation. I ask him whether he is prepared to look at those two suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the legislation, generally speaking the Democrats are not opposing these Bills. However, I wish to raise three particular concerns. I refer firstly to the Job Search and Newstart training supplements. By way of explanation, these supplements are made up of three components. Firstly, there is a training component. That is a maximum amount of $60 a fortnight to help with direct expenses related to training. Secondly, there is living away from home component. That is a maximum amount of $40 a fortnight for those over the age of 18, and a maximum amount of $30 for those aged under 18. This is to assist with expenses incurred in living away from the person's usual place of residence while actually undertaking the training. The final component is a home-based maintenance component, to a maximum of $75.80 a fortnight, to assist with the expenses of maintaining the person's usual residence while living away from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill imposes an age limit on the training component of the supplement, restricting it to persons who have turned 21. This effectively legalises what, in fact, has been carried out illegally for quite some time. It is in line with a 1987 Cabinet decision to equalise youth income support. That has basically meant a progressive reduction in all forms of income support down to a level well below the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, the Government has been unlawfully denying those under the age of 21 the training component of this supplement since 1 July last year. It has been caught out, as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal found only last month that there was absolutely no legislative basis for denying young people that allowance. Now the Government faces a pay-out of up to $5m in back payments to those young people who have done training courses over the past year. It is now moving to make sure that the 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds will not be able to get that component in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that this action is callous and illogical. We note that, despite all the bleatings and comments by members of the Opposition, they are going to support the Government again. I note that Senator Baume has made many speeches in this place, for which I commend him, on the major problems of young people who are unemployed. I appeal again to the Opposition to reconsider what it is now doing&mdash;further pushing these young people into poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To argue, as some do, that giving those under the age of 21 access to the component will give them financial incentive to give up long term study and move into short term training courses is a nonsense. It is laughable. Anyone who is seriously running this argument obviously does not have a clue about what is actually going on out there in the real world. Firstly, it is absurd to argue that a young person receiving Austudy and fortunate enough to actually have a place in a university or TAFE will voluntarily relinquish his long term training option to take up a short term training course&mdash;which he might not get into anyway, because only about a third of people actually make it&mdash;just to get $30 a week. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not about choice between long term education and short term training. There are simply not enough places in higher education, particularly in the TAFE system, to go around. Those young people who have such places are not going to give them up for the difficulty and uncertainty of unemployment on the off-chance that they may somehow one day end up with an extra $30 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, removal of the component not only acts as a disincentive for young people to voluntarily undertake training; it actually penalises young people on Job Search allowance who are required by the CES to undertake a training course. Thirdly, the component is not play money. It is used, it is needed, to make sure that the young people can access these training courses and assist them with meeting the additional expenses incurred when undertaking these courses. This effectively means that most, if not all, of the money does not actually see its way into the young person's pocket to buy anything that could even be vaguely considered a luxury. The amount left over, if any, is scarcely enough to be touted as some sort of an incentive for people moving from full time education into these part time courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there are many 18- to 20-year-olds who simply cannot get a place in long term study or training. Why should these young people be denied access to the extra component? They are already far more disadvantaged than their counterparts who are in long term study and who will get a piece of paper at the end of it that actually means something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, the Democrats see no sense in this move at a time of high youth unemployment, when we should be creating opportunities for our young people, not taking those opportunities away from them. We will be opposing these amendments. I make one last appeal to Opposition senators to really demonstrate their support for young unemployed Australians by joining us in the committee stage of this Bill to oppose these moves by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our second problem relates to third party consent. There is provision in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill to enable the Department to obtain the consent of third parties to have deductions made from their social security payments in satisfaction of another person's debt to the Department. While I can see a need for this and it may be acceptable to some social security recipients in some circumstances, I seek the Minister's assurance that it will be very clearly set out in the guidelines relating to the provision that the Department will not actively go out pressuring, inviting or requiring spouses or partners to agree on a deduction from their payments for their partner's debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final concern is self-incrimination. The number of calls and material coming into our office would indicate that the changes to the provisions of the Social Security Act relating to self-incrimination have been a cause for considerable concern and confusion. Until now persons required to give information to the Department could not refuse to provide the information on the ground it may tend to incriminate them. These provisions were coupled through the Act with sections stating that information given to the Department pursuant to a notice was not admissible in criminal proceedings and, accordingly, the Department or the Director of Public Prosecutions could not rely on this for prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill repeal both of these provisions. The effect is supposed to be that information provided under the notice provisions will now be admissible in criminal proceedings. But a person will be able to rely on the common law privilege against self-incrimination and refuse to supply the information in the first instance. There has been considerable confusion about whether the amendments as they are structured will in fact have this effect or whether they will work to the disadvantage of social security recipients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am grateful to the Minister for making available to me his letter to the Welfare Rights Centre in Sydney which sets out the Department's arguments about the changes. I accept the argument that the notices used by the Department are not likely to result in a person incriminating himself or herself but could still be used as evidence of fraud in a criminal prosecution. However, the point has been raised with me that there is really no need for the Department to prosecute under the Crimes Act; that the provisions within the Social Security Act are perfectly adequate; and that this change is really directed at the very small number of social security recipients whose fraud is not poverty related. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that these changes are not necessary to protect government revenue but the Department is simply adding another string to its bow which it can use if necessary. If that is the case, I ask the Minister for his assurance that it is not his intention to use these changes to prosecute under the Crimes Act the majority of social security recipients whose fraudulent activities could best be termed crimes of poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out to the Minister that, when a confusing and complex change such as this is being mooted, it is desirable to have some solid consultation with key groups and to ensure that the change is adequately explained to these groups. Here again, I highlight the need for the welfare rights centres to be fully involved in these sorts of changes. Lack of consultation on significant changes was a feature of the previous Minister's handling of this portfolio. I would not like to think that such an unacceptable and unsatisfactory practice will continue under the new Minister. </PARA>

The first concerns the question that I have spoken about both in parliamentary committee hearings and in other places, that is, the concern that many, aside from me, have of the way in which the Australian Taxation Office and the Commissioner of Taxation have chosen to deal with members of political parties. I deal only with matters that are on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I deal with a comparison that I have drawn between the way in which Mr Paul Keating, the Prime Minister, who was the Treasurer at the time, was dealt with for failure to lodge his annual tax return&mdash;I have tabled in this place a letter asking him in very polite terms whether he would please get it in&mdash;and the way in which 10,800-odd Australians were prosecuted in the course of 1990-91 for failure to do the same thing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter I want to raise is the question that we have discussed in this place before relating to the lease that the Australian Labor Party has secured from the Auditor-General for 15 years, with a five-year option, at 9 per cent annual increments for 6,000 square feet at a base rental of $330 per square metre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the discussions we have had, both my colleague Senator Parer and I have said that it is quite unacceptable that a political party, and any political party&mdash;and I stress that; my objections would be just as strong if it were the Liberal Party&mdash;should be the landlord of the Auditor-General. I have said that the Auditor-General has to be like Caesar's wife&mdash;above suspicion. The fact is that the taxpayer, via the rental paid by the Auditor-General, will totally fund the building of the Labor Party headquarters, and not only will the rental repayments more than adequately meet the mortgage payments which will be entered into but also, at the end of the day, there will be surplus funds. Aside from that, the terms of the lease will provide that the tenant&mdash;that is, the Auditor-General&mdash;will meet all the outgoing expenses, all the maintenance, repair of lifts and anything else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bothered to go out into the marketplace to find out just how legitimate any of this would be, even if one leaves aside the question of whether a political party could possibly be the landlord of the Auditor-General, the Australian National Audit Office. Professional advice tells me that the rental quantums and the increased percentage per annum border on being unprofessional; that the figures seem to be based on what the market was like three years ago rather than what it is like today; and that the lease document is bankable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is not without importance to note that none of the correspondence between the Australian National Audit Office and the Department of Finance, from whom permission had to be sought, in fact refers to the Australian Labor Party as being the landlord of the Australian National Audit Office. We are advised that by the beginning of this year the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) was aware of it, but it seems that great effort was put into not disclosing, in any of the correspondence&mdash;and I refer to all the correspondence that is tabled&mdash;that it was in fact the Labor Party which was to be the landlord. The title of the building all along seems to be `Lot 22 Barton' or the `yet to be named Lend Lease site at Barton opposite the National Press Club'. Clearly, this is totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the figures, I went a little further. It seems that the excavation for the building only went ahead after the lease agreement had in fact been signed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not for the first time in this chamber I rise to defend a person who has been subject to an attack in the Senate under privilege. I refer to a speech made on 3 June by Senator Bell in which, in the course of alleging unfair treatment by Australia Post against a former employee, he named a claims manager, Mr Lippiat, as hampering his efforts to assist the person concerned. I might say that I was unable, of course, to advise Senator Bell that I would be making these comments, as is the normal courtesy, as Senator Bell, I believe, is away on parliamentary business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Lippiat was described by Senator Bell as a `self-appointed vigilante', an unusual description, I believe, for an employee engaged in carrying out his duties. There was a strong inference that Mr Lippiat was a liar. Not only was Mr Lippiat subjected to this pejorative description, but he was the only Australia Post employee named by Senator Bell. The inference can also clearly be drawn that Mr Lippiat is the individual bearing prime responsibility for the alleged unfair treatment of the former employee, who I will call `Mr Y', catalogued at length by Senator Bell. I do not, of course, wish to canvass the merits of the case or indeed risk adding to the distress of Mr Y. Mr Lippiat has the right to raise his case with the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges, and it would not be appropriate to argue any detailed case at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that I do wish to make very strongly is the gross unfairness of Senator Bell in attacking an individual with whom he has not sought to speak and who he has not contacted prior to naming him in Parliament. Surely, if Senator Bell thought that Mr Lippiat was as guilty as he claims him to be, he would have sought to find the facts and at least speak with Mr Lippiat prior to making a speech about the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Lippiat is an employee simply doing his job. This type of public attack cannot be a threat to his continuation in that job, and it is the very kind of affront to natural justice that Senator Bell was alleging. Whatever steps are now taken to put the other side of the story and to clear Mr Lippiat's name, the damage has clearly been done. I do not believe that parliamentary privilege in any way, shape or form was ever designed for any senator or any member of parliament to damage a person's credibility in the way in which Senator Bell has damaged Mr Lippiat's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At times there may be grounds for senators to make strong attacks on the actions of statutory bodies, but this should not, however, degenerate into attacks upon officials who have no quick access to rebut such allegations. The Democrats in the Senate are entitled to pursue a particular attitude to compensation questions, even if some of us doubt that in all cases the client is in the right. I am not suggesting for one moment that was the case with Mr Y as I am not in a position to judge. What saddens me is the recourse to abuse of individual claims officers or medical practitioners, wilfully damaging career prospects and professional reputations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take this opportunity to raise an issue that has attracted considerable comment in the business pages of most newspapers today. I refer to the sudden concern about the possibility of some tax avoidance under the Australian Taxation Office's new swaps regime for bringing income to account by bankers under what is known as swaps trading. The Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Boucher, has today announced that he is suddenly very concerned at the opportunity for tax avoidance created by his Office's ruling on swaps which was issued on 21 May 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My response to that is: I told you so. From the very beginning of the debate on the appropriate tax accounting for swaps transactions, the banking industry at large and I in the Senate asserted two things: firstly, that the cash basis will give rise to tax avoidance, and I refer to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 4 September 1991; and, secondly, that the cash basis is wrong tax accounting, and I refer to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 4 September 1991 and 26 May 1992. The answer is and always has been that, if one wants to fix the avoidance risk in this industry, one just fixes the tax accounting treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The error in the ruling was to require daily accruals for cash flows in arrears but cash basis for cash flows in advance. The remedy simply is to require daily accruals for all swaps flows, irrespective of their time of payment. The fact that there are two regimes, one for swaps flows in advance and another for swaps flows in arrears, means that at a 30 June take-off one is bound to have a bringing together of as many of the transactions as possible before the end of June, or to commence at 1 July, depending on one's particular position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point that, if the Commissioner of Taxation had bothered to listen to what was said in the Senate on this matter, he would now not be concerned, he would now not have to make another ruling and he would not have been subject to such a run on the revenue. This is because, if an advance swaps payment or a prepayment were treated on a daily accruals basis and thus tax effected over the period to which it relates, which is the appropriate method, there would be no up-front tax deduction obtained before 30 June for an advance payment under a swap entered into today. It is as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to the burning issue of retrospectivity. The ruling issued in May discriminated against taxpayers, especially banks, who in the past had tax effected all their swaps cash flows on a daily accrual basis, which is the normal, internationally recognised method of bringing income and expense to account. In my speech on 26 May I pointed out that this discrimination was ludicrous and it was very costly to business because the Tax Office had just recognised in its ruling that the daily accrual basis was the correct method. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I can add that the tax accounting method adopted by such banks saved the revenue significant amounts because it deliberately did not take advantage of the loophole that Mr Boucher is suddenly so concerned about. Those banks did not take up-front deductions for advance swaps payments, which the cash basis and that ruling in May permitted. It was a surprise ruling. It astounded everybody who has any notion of accounting or understanding of tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Senate to support the following: firstly, the consistent application of daily accruals tax accounting to all swaps cash flows, which is logical but necessary; secondly, a non-retrospective operation for the ruling so that taxpayers who consistently and, may I emphasise, correctly adopted the daily accruals basis in the past should not have their tax position disturbed; and, thirdly, an amendment to the recent ruling to achieve the outcomes in which both the first and the second recommendations can be achieved. I therefore urge the Senate and the Tax Office to ensure that we have a situation where the Tax Office can examine these positions and amend its rulings accordingly. </PARA>

These Bills phase out assistance to the dairy industry to ensure that by the year 2000 the level will be equal to a 5 per cent tariff. This is important legislation because it will carry the manufacturing sector of the dairying industry, in particular, through to the turn of the century and beyond&mdash;that is 70 per cent of the industry in Australia, with over $700m of export. It is the most significant regional industry in Australia, employing about 100,000 people directly and indirectly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation replaces what has become known as the Kerin plan. It has been a basically successful five-year program which has given stability to an industry through the all milk levy and other components. At the same time there has been a very rapid rationalisation and increase in productivity in that industry. People tend to forget that the Kerin plan bears very little relationship to Minister Kerin. The original proposal he brought to the Parliament was held up for 12 months and considerably amended by a combination of my colleagues, including Ralph Hunt, the then honourable member for Gwydir, the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation and the Dairy Industry Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would remind the Senate that the five-year program owes its success very much to the Opposition as well as to the Government. The dairy industry has made it very clear that it does not want any delays to the legislation, and the coalition agrees with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is the normal practice, whether it is a Labor or a coalition government in office, there was an Industry Commission inquiry into the industry. One of the major aspects of the Industry Commission's recommendations related to city milk. Of course, that is regulated by the States. The States said that they were not going along with that particular part of it, so that has been put to one side, as I think everyone anticipated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the manufacturing sector, the Government has basically followed the recommendations of the Industry Commission, with two exceptions. The Industry Commission recommended a phase-down starting with 20 per cent support through all milk levy for the coming season and going down to 5 per cent by July 1986. The Government, through the legislation, has recommended a 12-month delay or holding at the present 22 per cent level, down to 10 per cent by the year 2000. As the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, has said, this is the equivalent of about a 5 per cent support arrangement because of the mix between the domestic market and export market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's decision is basically in line with general coalition policy, that is, that all industries should by the year 2000 be down to a negligible or 5 per cent level of tariff or its equivalent. The Government in this case has actually treated the dairy industry harder than it has some other industries, for example, the textile, clothing and footwear industries and the motor vehicle industry. By the year 2000 they will be down to tariff levels of 25 per cent and 15 per cent in each case. The fact that the Government is not treating those industries in the same way as it is treating the dairy industry and many other industries adds to dairy farmers' costs, and the dairy farmers of Australia are well aware of that. They know very well that there are absolutely no tariffs on imported dairy products and there have not been for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if there were tariffs on dairy products imported into Australia from other countries, the fact is that under closer economic relations with New Zealand there are no tariff restrictions on products from New Zealand; there are no dumping or countervailing procedures on products from New Zealand. New Zealand has, in overall terms, the most efficient manufacturing dairy industry in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand has some advantages, particularly now that the New Zealand Government has undertaken some very significant industrial relations reforms so that there is greater efficiency in its factories, greater efficiency in its transport and, particularly, greater efficiency on its waterfront. It is said that the average New Zealand dairy farmer is $3,500 a year better off than he was before these reforms, purely because of the genuine reforms that have taken place on the waterfront. The Australian dairy farmer has not had the equivalent advantage. New Zealand dairy farmers also have the advantage of a goods and services tax which reduces their cost of production and assists them with exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that I am making is that the presence of New Zealand limits the ability of the industry, irrespective of any other arrangements, to increase the price of dairy products sold on the domestic market in Australia&mdash;that is, butter, cheese et cetera. There are absolutely no impediments to those products coming in from New Zealand. I know that some people would add other arguments, that there are benefits for New Zealand because of its pooling arrangements and the special access it had to the European Community&mdash;still at quite a high price. I believe we had a good example of industry leadership that has worked its way through the Government in a sensible and pragmatic way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major feature of this legislation is the all milk levy. It provides the stability with regard to export assistance or incentives, which maintains the stability on both the domestic market and the export market. That is paid for by every dairy farmer in Australia. It is not paid for by government under any budgetary arrangements. The maximum is 45c per kilogram fat and the maximum level of theoretical assistance was 30 per cent. But it is at 22 per cent at the present time and I have indicated that it is coming down over the next five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dairy industry has suffered more than any other agricultural industry in Australia from unfair trade practices internationally. The European Community got a surplus position with the dairy industry over 10 years ago. It was well ahead of the grain industry, the sugar industry, the beef industry or any horticultural industry. In fact, there have been countervailing actions against those European export subsidies for quite a few years. At the same time as we have given unlimited access to European cheese, provided it is on a fair trade basis, the EC has restricted our access to a far larger market in Europe to 3,000 tonnes a year, with a 24 per cent common external tariff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the Government has accepted the advice of the Senate Committee and, after pressure from the coalition, has now changed its previously absurd three-year sunset arrangement when there is any dumping or countervailing action, to a five-year arrangement which allows for the case to be looked at again to see that, if subsidisation is continuing, the countervailing duty also continues. The industry does have a dilemma. Does it go back to try countervailing again or does it stick with the current arrangement? That is a difficult decision for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point, too, about the pressure having been on the dairy industry longer than on other processed agricultural industries in Australia. It was probably the first to be put under pressure by the supermarkets for generic or home brands. That has also been coupled with pressures on imports by some of the supermarket chains. It is one of the problems that the industry faces at the moment, in spite of improvements to the fair trade procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a coalition government, as we have indicated publicly, we would have far tougher criteria on this question of material injury. It would allow for a shorter time span before application was made, and then halve the time after that application was made for both tentative and final duties. There is still a problem, and it is something that we in opposition and the Government have to face up to. It is not just unique to the dairy industry and the case it has with Dutch edam, which is definitely being export subsidised and sold at the moment here in Australia at a far less than normal selling price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pig industry and other industries face it. Even when an industry has a wider ability to make an application&mdash;that is, one that is affected, such as the farmer with the dairy or the pig producer with pork&mdash;unless the processing sector is prepared to provide the necessary information on costs and therefore work through to a selling price et cetera, or unless the supermarkets, if they are the straight importers, are prepared to provide that information, there is still a difficulty in really making the application and reaching a just decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Food standards is another area in which the dairying industry was probably subjected to some of these problems earlier than others. The States have been very lax in their determinations of these standards. Preservatives which have been banned in Australia because they are supposedly cancer forming have been allowed in imported cheese. We are never told publicly about the degree of listeria that is uncovered in tests on imported cheese. I am pleased that we now have a National Food Authority and are making progress. I acknowledge that it is up to the States, as the component parts of the National Food Authority, to push a damn sight harder than they are at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another factor in relation to this legislation is underwriting. The Industry Commission recommended that underwriting be continued. It was the Industry Commission that invented this in the first place quite a few years ago. The underwriting for dairying is very market related. There is an eight-year trend line and then 85 per cent of that, and then the Industry Commission also recommended a $22m ceiling. I know that my colleague the shadow Minister for primary industries, Mr Bruce Lloyd, personally supports this and believes that underwriting, whether it is for dairying or for wheat or whatever, is a sensible thing to have in place to provide stability when something happens unfairly in the international market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Underwriting has been triggered only once in the past five or six years, at the $22m mark in 1991. That was the year in which the Europeans increased their export subsidies and it was the bad year for grain. That would have provided a maximum of $4,000 for Victorian and Tasmanian dairy farmers who are the major beneficiaries of underwriting because they have the greatest export exposure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us compare that with the coalition's Fightback policy on reducing costs to farmers by the removal of fuel excises, payroll tax and sales tax. Every year farmers will have their costs reduced by $8,000 and it will not matter whether they are Victorian dairy farmers or Northern Territory dairy farmers. That is the positive that puts us far ahead of Labor when it comes to total policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also committed to implementing a far better income equalisation deposit scheme. I hope the Government itself is doing that because, although there is stability in relative terms in the dairy industry compared to some others, there still should be better incentives to encourage farmers to take out their own self-insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has acknowledged that he is prepared to do some work with regard to getting uniform State cooperative legislation. I believe that my colleague Mr Bruce Lloyd is in concurrence with the Minister as he has also been having discussions with some of his State colleagues. Cooperatives are essential, in both the horticultural and dairy industries, to provide some leverage and reasonable power for producers. The State restrictions we have at the present time do not allow cooperatives to become national in a sensible way. We all know some of the examples of State legislation having prevented sensible amalgamations for cooperatives from taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition parties support the legislation because it provides further rationalisation of the industry in the sense of moving to a more internationally competitive position in relation to what it is producing. But we recognise that if anything like a level playing field develops internationally over the next few years&mdash;whether it is for a commercial price for dairy products as distinct from the corrupt price of the present time, or for access to a fair basis to those markets&mdash;the dairy industry in this country has a very great future as an expanded industry and one which will play its part in further exports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 1992 and the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Amendment Bill 1992, which are before the Senate today, represent a tremendous change for the dairy industry. This industry has been determined to restructure, to become more efficient and to be able to compete on world markets. It has had no choice, naturally, because if it had not rationalised and restructured, it would not be able to compete in the way it is required to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this legislation the Government has basically followed the recommendations of the Industry Commission report with a number of exceptions. One of the main arguments in that report was that Australian consumers would get cheaper milk if controls in the Australian dairy industry were removed. It said that further reductions in assistance must take place if the dairy industry is to maximise its contribution to national welfare, adding that the Australian industry had to prepare for increased competition from New Zealand dairy products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, it recommended that assistance to the industry should be phased out in the next two to 10 years and that the Commonwealth should phase down maximum market support payments from 20 per cent of average export prices to 5 per cent by 1996. The Government, through this legislation, has recommended a 12-month delay or holding at the present 22 per cent level down to 10 per cent by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, I am pleased that some of the Commission's recommendations have not been accepted by the Government. Indeed, if the report were accepted in its totality, I ask honourable senators whether they honestly believe that the whole community would have benefited if, in the long run, its proposed changes resulted in decreased production, a significant reduction in jobs and the industry being unable to compete on world markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So often now we see that the Industry Commission seems to believe that it is acceptable for Australia to become a dumping ground. It is asking Australian farmers and manufacturers to accept as right and proper, prices which are based on the world market's dumped prices. We have seen this asked of producers in other rural industries. These prices are the result of political decisions in Brussels and Washington, and do not reflect retail prices in the exporting countries where consumers are paying more for their produce than Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian dairy industry is alive with innovation, technical progress and a driving will to compete. Our dairy foods are as good as, and in many cases better than, any in the world. Dairy food exports earn more than $700m each year. The industry's major investments in research, technology and market development will see these export earnings grow. Dairy farm productivity is increasing by 5 per cent per year, as it has for the past decade. The industry's willingness to adapt to change means that it will benefit from even minor reforms in the international trading environment. Already Australians buy premier quality dairy foods at prices as low as anywhere in the world. Australian dairy farmers produce milk at lower cost than those in Europe, the USA, Canada or Japan, thanks to our pasture-based farming. In fact, few countries can produce quality dairy products as cheaply as Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than 100,000 Australians have jobs thanks to the dairy industry. The industry provides about 20 per cent of employment in a number of important dairying regions. This is especially important in light of the particularly difficult times that rural Australia is now experiencing. Studies show that, for every 100 jobs in dairy factories, an additional 110 jobs are created in associated regional activities and the flow-on effects beyond the region are about as large again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dairying is a very `real' industry, close to the people it employs, part of everyone's day-to-day life, and earning export dollars for all Australians. Currently, Australia's dairy industry manufactures many specialised products for markets here and overseas and its farmers currently produce milk valued at some $1.7 billion each year, all of which is processed within Australia. On top of this, processed dairy foods are valued at about $4.5 billion a year, an added value of $3 billion annually. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Representations to me from the Australian dairy industry indicate that it recognises that neither regulation nor protection offer a panacea for the problems created by unfair world trade policies. However, the industry does advocate a thoughtful and cautious approach to addressing the future. The Australian dairy industry, with minimal assistance, competes in corrupted world markets and against subsidised imports&mdash;and, importantly, the industry funds its own export marketing arrangements. Nothing will be gained by sacrificing the dairy industry's hard-won international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian dairy industry has asked for a continuation of existing marketing arrangements in order to capitalise on the changes already implemented, to obtain significant returns on the large investment in research and development, to continue to enhance productivity, to facilitate continuing change, and to take advantage of improvements in the international trading environment. I believe that those are very worthy objects of the Australian dairy industry, and the National Party supports these dairy Bills before the Senate today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it the International Air Services Commission Bill 1992. This Bill deals with the allocation of international air traffic rights. International aviation is covered by bilateral agreements between the countries to which the airlines are operating. This matter has not been a problem for us in Australia in the past. We have had only one international carrier, Qantas, so the allocation of the traffic rights as a consequence of the various bilateral agreements which Australia has had in existence since the Second World War has not been a problem at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation has now changed, following the Government's policy statement earlier in this year which allows other Australian carriers to enter the air traffic between Australia and other countries. I presume&mdash;I have not checked this&mdash;that the policy statement of the Government does not mean only Ansett but any new carriers within Australia would be entitled to bid for these routes, in the fullness of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite obvious that, if routes are to be allocated, there is a situation where fairness needs to be seen to be done in the allocation of those traffic rights&mdash;that there is clearly equal treatment afforded. That is what this Bill sets out to do: to set up a commission to sit in judgment on the allocation of those routes so that the public interest is preserved and, of course, the commercial interests of the airlines applying for those routes, so that they have a fair opportunity to prosecute their business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In international air traffic at the present time, there is clearly a place for other carriers of Australian origin to become involved. One of the difficulties of a monopoly situation is that a monopoly carrier, as Qantas has been, does not always meet the market demands. It tends to look after its own interests to the exclusion of others. As a senator from a State where there is quite a deal of primary production&mdash;Queensland is probably the leading primary producer for the Australian export market&mdash;on many occasions over the years I have been made aware that international freight traffic, in vegetables and flowers, for example, cannot be developed because of the lack of a freight service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite numerous appeals to Qantas to set up a dedicated freight service, where time is of the essence of getting into markets in South East Asia and Europe, Qantas has never done so. It has shown no interest at all in running a freight service. Unless that service is there, the export trade simply cannot be developed. The two go hand in hand and the provision of the freight service is fundamental. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example of where Qantas failed to meet the market occurred some years ago, when it became the only airline in the world to have an all-Boeing 747 fleet. It made a great thing about that at the time but the consequence of having a single aircraft type to operate its route structure was a great deal of inflexibility. Qantas simply could not service a lot of the routes in the South Pacific region and the near Asian markets, where the traffic was not too heavy. It is a matter of history that it had to go to a second aircraft type&mdash;a smaller aircraft, the Boeing 767, which has worked out very well for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is need for competition on this but in the allocation of new route structures, in all fairness to Qantas, recognition has got to be given to the work it has put into developing routes and the financial investment it has made in carrying routes that were not profitable for years until they did become profitable. There is a need for a fine balance here. It is not a one-way street. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a few general comments about the Bill. The first thing is the structure of the Commission itself. The Commission is going to have a staff of 12: a part time chairman working three days per week; two members working one day per week; a secretary, a second level SES equivalent; three divisional heads class 2; and five research and support staff. The Minister estimates that it is going to cost the Commonwealth $2.2m a year initially to operate this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a commission to determine the allocation of routes is something that has been used in a number of countries overseas where there are a number of international flag carriers for that country. It would appear that the approach being proposed to the Australian Parliament is one that is based on the United States system. There is an alternative model used by the United Kingdom which provides for public hearings for the allocation of all international rights, and, of course, this Bill does provide that, wherever practicable, hearings will be in public also. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the difficulties that has become apparent with the United Kingdom system, though, is that it has developed into a goldmine for aviation lawyers, where every decision has been fought and fought with great tenacity by all the interest groups involved, the airlines, the tourist agencies and things like that. I would hope that the Australian Commission does not act as a source of income for the already profligate number of lawyers that we have in this country. Not only are we tying up personnel there, we are certainly tying up the commerce of the country on the development of routes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the coalition's view that in government we would certainly support the Commission and its duties as defined in this Bill, but we would think that a more appropriate staffing would be three on the Commission as proposed, two research staff for research and performance monitoring of the route structure, and 2 support staff. In other words, we would favour a staffing of seven instead of the 12 that are proposed here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would certainly also include the allocation of charter flights, which is not mentioned at all in this Bill. It may be the intention of the Minister to include it&mdash;he may make reference to that in his reply. Certainly, it is part and parcel of all the traffic and the charter services really ought to be included. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I would make is that in the interpretation section of the Bill, there is simply no definition of an Australian carrier, and I find that quite unusual. In the interpretation section, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Australian carrier", in relation to particular capacity, means a person who:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) conducts, or proposes to conduct, an international airline service to and from Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) under the bilateral arrangement to which the capacity relates, may be permitted to carry passengers or freight, or both passengers and freight, under that arrangement as an airline designated by Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>As a nationalist, I would have felt much more comfortable if there were some definition as to who owned an Australian carrier. But maybe there is a reason for that. The general conditions under which the Commission has to operate are, first of all, as I have said before, the preservation of the public interest, which is important. There is provision for a finite time allocation of rights, in general five years. An airline cannot be granted a traffic right and hold it in perpetuity. There is an ability to transfer: if one airline which has been awarded an international route cannot use it or does not wish to use it, there is provision for that to be transferred to another carrier. Most importantly, there is a prohibition on stock holding, which is somebody applying for and being granted a traffic right and not using it merely to keep a competitor off that route. There are limitations on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would make the observation that the Bill does show evidence of hasty drafting. The sequencing of the clauses could have been much neater and it could have followed a much more logical grouping of clauses than we have in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, the Bill does vest very considerable powers in the Commission. It certainly has a great degree of independence in coming to its decisions, though it is required to comply with the general requirements laid down in policy statements by the Minister. I only hope that complying with those policy statements does not mean that we are faced with a very mobile area. I hope that policy, once set, stays reasonably permanent for a number of years so that we do not have that opportunity provided for legal challenge and all the costs and delays that come from that. Also, if there is not stability in the way the Commission operates and the way the policy statements are laid down, we are going to have a great deal of commercial uncertainty, which will reflect on the profitability of the airlines. If the airlines are unprofitable, Australia's interest is not being served. I wish the Bill a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator MacGibbon for his support of the International Air Services Commission Bill. I must say that his support for the Bill does not surprise me because as someone who long campaigned along with my then opposite number, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Paul Everingham, for an end to the two airlines agreement, I had cause to read the Federal Parliamentary debates that were conducted on the two airlines agreement when that agreement was renewed, amid a great deal of controversy, by the Fraser Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did note in those debates the views of Senator MacGibbon on the renewal of that arrangement. So I know, and am prepared to concede, that he has adopted a very pro-competitive stance in respect of airline arrangements in the past. I will just address those matters that Senator MacGibbon has raised. As the Bill makes quite specific, the applications, of course, are open to anyone, not simply to Ansett. However&mdash;Senator MacGibbon would acknowledge this in terms of the need to have a viable carrier operating these routes&mdash;Ansett would be well placed following the amalgamation of Australian and Qantas, to be certainly in the running for those routes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the start-up costs, we have attempted&mdash;and I am sure Senator MacGibbon would acknowledge this&mdash;to keep this as lean and mean as we can. I do stress that the $2.2m is a start. The reason that I make that statement is that I think that within probably a relatively short period of time, hopefully, this body will have to do less and less work. I say that because there is a continuing trend around the world, which I know Senator MacGibbon is aware of, to make even more and more liberal the capacity arrangements that are made currently by bilateral arrangements between countries. I hope that it does get to the point where these capacity constraints are removed and that capacity will be able to meet these demands without any need for any real adjudication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the feast for lawyers is concerned, you open up that possibility with any piece of legislation that is introduced into the Parliament. All I can say in respect of that is that we have received advice from people who are acknowledged as being experts in the area of aviation law. A comment that was made to us by one person eminent in that area was that it is as good an attempt as he has seen compared with other regimes around the world, two of which Senator MacGibbon referred to, to make this as sensible and as dispute-free an approach. All we can do is acknowledge that that is a potential problem and hope, along with Senator MacGibbon, it will not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Charters will certainly be an area which will be made clear later on. I will be looking to advice from the Commission on that, particularly in relation to the impact of those charters on the designated routes that were available for scheduled carriers on such routes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the definition of `Australian carrier' is concerned, I will take that on board to see whether there is any need to further define it. But we cannot, as Senator MacGibbon is aware, under the ICAO agreements around the world designate a national carrier unless that carrier is owned 65 per cent by nationals of the country for which the designation applies. For that reason it was not thought necessary to define it but we will certainly take that on board and if we think that we could add further clarification then we will have a look at that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One final point I would simply like to make is that this is a pro-competitive model. There are screams and yells about it. I acknowledge that and they are coming from the airlines because you cannot expect airlines that have enjoyed a monopoly for a very long period of time&mdash;and for a large part of that time for good reason&mdash;to be particularly happy about having competition introduced. But the people who do undeniably benefit at the end of the day are the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to highlight one section of the Bill, clause 8, which indicates how pro-competitive this measure is. Section 8 is an important section in the legislation. It provides for the Commission to examine the renewal of allocations at the end of an original determination. Under the legislation, read in conjunction with the policy statement, the Commission will be able to properly consider reallocation of part of the capacity allocated to an incumbent carrier in appropriate cases to encourage competition. The criteria which must be applied under the policy statement by the Commission when assessing the renewal of existing determinations include carrier performance and public benefit. This could provide reallocation where it is demonstrated that an alternative use of the capacity would better serve the public benefit even though the existing use was of some benefit to the public. With that final clarification I thank the Opposition for its support of the legislation and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports passage of the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Amendment Bill. This is the second stage of Australia's progression towards ratification of the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, which was entered into in 1988. The purpose of the convention, as set out in article 2, is to promote cooperation among the parties so that they may address more effectively the various aspects of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances having an international dimension. Pursuing that aim, the parties to the convention are to take necessary measures, including legislative and administrative measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Australia, the first step was the passage of the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act of 1990. That Act, which will come into force when the convention takes effect, was designed to extend Australia's extraterritorial jurisdiction over drug related crimes. It preserved existing State and Territory laws which create criminal offences for conduct involving dealing in drugs. This Bill amends the 1990 Act to give effect to obligations under the convention to criminalise money laundering and to confiscate the proceeds of drug offences. The effect of the Bill will be to apply Federal legislation to allow for the confiscation of assets in relation to State drug offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has three separate areas of concern in relation to this Bill. Firstly, we are concerned that the Bill may affect the balance of Federal-State responsibilities in the area of drug offences. During the 1990 debate it was emphasised that ratification of the convention could not occur until consultations with the States and Territories had been concluded and all States and Territories had enacted legislation for the confiscation of assets derived from dealing in drugs. However, not all States and Territories have yet done so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition was concerned that it was not clear that the States had agreed to the Federal Government proceeding with this Bill using the external affairs power. However, during the debate in the other place, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) emphasised that this Bill will apply only to those States and Territories which have not yet made it an offence to launder money or property which is derived from drug trafficking. All States and Territories have expressed their willingness to do so and only three are yet to act. This legislation will enable the Government to press ahead towards ratification of the convention, and we, of course, support it in this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we are concerned about the minimum 12 months imprisonment penalty level which is to apply in determining what is a serious State drug offence. Specifically, we are concerned that this threshold may be too low. For example, related offences under the Federal Act may lead to imprisonment for up to 20 years. Moreover, there are many State drug offences which are not particularly serious which carry penalties of more than 12 months imprisonment. We further note that under the Federal Telecommunications (Interception) Act of 1979 a serious offence is defined as one attracting a penalty of more than seven years imprisonment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button. I refer to the Prime Minister's comments on Tuesday when he said that something good was happening in the labour market, and that the jobs that were being created in recent years were ones where, `people can start off quite young in the job and find themselves in London for six months or find themselves in Tokyo and back in Australia'. How many of Australia's youth jobs are of that type? Is a youth unemployment rate of 34 per cent&mdash;according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the body which officially monitors these figures&mdash;something good happening in the labour market?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In making that statement, I think the Prime Minister was drawing attention to the changing nature of Australian industry, the increasing internationalisation of Australian firms and the consequences which flow from that in terms of job opportunities and different kinds of job opportunities both now and into the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the question of 34 per cent of the 15- to 19-year-old age cohort seeking employment and not being able to obtain it, yes, that figure is correct. But I have to say that it has to be put in this perspective: while the overall tragedy of unemployment is particularly saddening in respect of youth unemployment, it also impacts on other groups in the community very severely and, particularly, in the present circumstances, on male wage earners and those who are in the older age group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just make the point that I made the other day, that in terms of the consequences of this recession and youth unemployment, the aggregate numbers of people in the 15- to 19-year-old age group seeking work and unable to obtain work are fewer than they were in the 1983 recession. That is because of significant changes which have taken place in the composition and activity of that age group. For example, in Senator Hill's own State of South Australia, there are 2,000 fewer people in that age group seeking work and not able to obtain it in this year than there were in 1983. That is a pattern which results, as I said, from increasing participation in the education system by a whole range of young people, which is an important advance in terms of our international position and comparisons which we like to make at the present time with other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said on a number of occasions, that does not mean that the Government is not very concerned about that age group; it is giving consideration to ways in which the problem of that group may be alleviated.

In fact, there are fewer 15- to 19-year-olds looking for jobs in Australia now than there were during the Howard recession in the early 1980s. The seasonally adjusted employment level for 15- to 19-year-olds looking for full time work fell from 157,700 in April 1983 to 131,100 in May 1992, a drop of 26,600.

It is important that the facts of this matter are properly presented so that people can make their own judgments. Since 1983, when this Government came to power, it has succeeded in doubling school retention rates. We have increased expenditure in real terms on education by 42 per cent. Since 1972 there has been an explosion in the number of university places. Since 1983 we have created the equivalent of 17 new universities in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of some press reports of recent statements by the Human Rights Commissioner, Brian Burdekin, concerning his description of the conditions that prevail in some Australian gaols, as he put it, in contravention of the United Nations convention concerning torture in relation to cruel, inhuman or degrading conditions of imprisonment. I must say that he had never brought those matters to the attention of the Federal Attorney-General before he appeared before a committee. When matters were presented to the United Nations committee which deals with these matters&mdash;the torture committee&mdash;in November 1991, no note of concern emerged from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in the preparation of Australia's report to that committee. So I find it quite extraordinary that this very lurid description of the state of Australia's gaols should fall from the lips of the Human Rights Commissioner in this way. That is not to say that it is not a matter which ought to be of concern. It obviously needs to be assessed by the Government, as it no doubt will be by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the Federal Government has certain interests in relation to the State prison system and the Territory prison system in so far as Federal prisoners are incarcerated in those institutions&mdash;we do not have Federal prisons as, for example, is the case in the United States. Of course, that is what gives the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission its interest in the matter of the holding of some prisoners in State gaols, namely Federal prisoners in those gaols. That is one way in which we as a Federal Government get a particular interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler asked whether the United Nations convention itself might give us power. The only way in which the United Nations convention of itself can give the Federal Government power is by agreement of this Parliament that a law be passed through both Houses to allow the convention to have that effect. It is not the case that merely ratifying the treaty overrides any State or Territory law in relation to prisons or any other matter of State or, for that matter, Federal activity. It is always dependent on the judgment of this Federal Parliament as to whether the convention should be implemented into Australian law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the matters raised by Senator Spindler require further consideration. It has certainly been the case in Federal sentencing law that we have made it abundantly clear to judges and magistrates that when a person accused of a Federal offence&mdash;such as drug trafficking, fraud against the Commonwealth or tax evasion of some types&mdash;is convicted before them, imprisonment is a sentence of last resort and that everything ought to be done short of imprisonment if that is at all possible and appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to Senator Spindler's final question about a prison officers' code of conduct and the particular training of prison officials, officers and so on, I think that is a matter that could well be put before the meeting of corrective service Ministers which I understand is to take place in mid-July. I will undertake to ensure that all Ministers are apprised of Senator Spindler's concern and that of the Human Rights Commissioner, Brian Burdekin. No doubt we will be able to have a discussion then amongst all those who have an interest or responsibility for the condition of prisons in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As well as continuing to actively pursue the final negotiation of a global convention in Geneva, which is in the final and most critical stages of negotiation right now, we have been pursuing, since the then Prime Minister Mr Hawke initiated the exercise in mid-1988, a regional chemical weapons initiative designed to develop within our own immediate area of South East Asia and the South Pacific an active support program to stand behind that convention once implemented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program has sought to strengthen the existing regional consensus which exists against chemical weapons and to prepare countries of the region for early signature of the convention. We have successfully hosted two policy seminars on this subject in 1989 and 1990 and a technical workshop in 1991. This weekend there will be a further major seminar in Sydney of senior policy officials from 21 of the 23 regional countries&mdash;and that attendance reflects the close and increasingly intense interest this exercise is generating. We are looking for quite tangible outcomes from this seminar, in particular, agreement on practical preparatory activity by regional states. We will also be proposing the exchange of statements now of non-possession, non-production and non-development of chemical weapons as an action in support of the convention and as a kind of regional confidence building measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are convinced that early adherence to the convention once its text is agreed, as we hope it will be in the next two or three months, by all states of the South East Asia and South Pacific regions, is a very important Australian economic and security policy objective. We are investing resources required to keep these issues squarely in the forefront of the minds of regional policy-makers and the basic strategy, as I have said, is to try to ensure maximum regional support for the convention because of the demonstration effect that will hopefully have in other parts of the world.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I became aware yesterday that the United States Supreme Court in a six to three majority decision decided that it was lawful for the United States Government to seize suspects in a foreign country and forcibly return them to the United States for trial, notwithstanding that the United States has an extradition treaty with the foreign country concerned. I think that decision is a deeply disturbing one for the international community. It makes the question of proceeding under an extradition treaty something which is optional as far as the United States Executive is concerned if it wants to bring a person before a United States court for trial on some alleged offence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that honourable senators would find the notion of government sponsored kidnapping of persons overseas to bring them back for trial a deeply disturbing one. It certainly requires reflection by the Australian Government. The Attorney-General's Department is having a look at the implications as far as they may affect the structure of our extradition arrangements with the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Supreme Court seems to have taken the view that, in the absence of a specific provision in the United States-Mexican extradition treaty prohibiting the unilateral abduction of a suspect from the territory of one party by the other party, such abductions are permitted. As Australia does not have a clause in its extradition treaty with the United States expressly prohibiting kidnapping, it obviously raises at least the theoretical possibility of the United States exercising the option now sanctioned by the United States Supreme Court of abducting a person from Australia to face trial in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be said that that would involve a breach of Australia's sovereignty and expose the United States personnel, or anybody else who committed such a kidnapping within Australia, to criminal sanctions under Australian law. Therefore, it requires a very deliberate reflection by the Australian Government on this judgment, and that will occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth stating that this was a six to three opinion, which is a very substantial majority. Nevertheless, it may be of interest to honourable senators if I quote the dissenting judgment, which states that legal opinion:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is shocking that a party to an extradition treaty might believe that it has secretly reserved the right to make seizures of citizens in the other party's territory. . . (It would make the treaty) into little more than verbiage.</PARA>

Therefore, I can assure the Senate that this decision and its consequences will be subjected to the most thorough reflection by the Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and concerns Cambodia. What is the Australian Government's assessment of the pressures towards a breakdown of the Cambodia peace process, given the recent statements and actions of the Khmer Rouge? Given that the Khmer Rouge refuses to attend and continues to refuse to allow its troops to be disarmed, can progress still be made at the Tokyo conference next week? What steps is Australia taking to further isolate the Khmer Rouge from the material support it had been receiving from China and Thailand? In particular, what hope lies in any new approach by the interim government in Thailand appointed by the King this week? With regard to China, what influence has the Minister sought to bring to bear concerning Cambodia in his talks today with the Chinese Foreign Minister?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said on the weekend, it is certainly too early to make any judgments that the settlement in Cambodia is imminently in danger of complete breakdown. Opinions differ as to what precisely is motivating the Khmer Rouge to engage in its present attitude of non-cooperation. There are some aspects of the position of the Khmer Rouge which do lend themselves to some rational discussion and consideration by UNTAC, by the SNC and by the other countries that are concerned with a sensible outcome to this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other aspects of the Khmer Rouge's position do have a bloody-minded quality about them, which rather demonstrates a lack of seriousness of purpose as far as the settlement is concerned. But, as I keep saying, it is premature to make any judgment as to whether this indicates some fundamental change of position on its part or whether it is an exercise in brinkmanship designed to secure advantage or an improvement in its position in various ways. The balance of judgment at the moment is in favour of the latter characterisation but, clearly, if this non-cooperation continues for too long, whatever the motivations and whatever the nature of the rationale for its position, it will have the same effect: there will be a breakdown of the peace settlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everybody is extremely conscious of that&mdash;the Chinese no less than anyone else. In my discussions today, there was a very clear reaffirmation by the Chinese Government of its support for the settlement process, its concern to ensure that there is a comprehensive and serious implementation of it by all parties&mdash;internal and external&mdash;and agreement with the proposition that I put. The proposition was that, among other forms of pressure that should be applied at the moment, there should be a very clear message delivered to the Khmer Rouge that, if the settlement were to break down, it would be utterly and completely isolated: it would be a pariah as far as every country in the world is concerned. There was very explicit agreement to that proposition from the Chinese, which I found a welcome reaffirmation of their position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are engaged in close discussion with Thailand. Discussions as recently as last night&mdash;I saw the cables a few minutes ago&mdash;suggest that the Thais are acutely conscious of the significance of their geographic role and the contribution they can make to maintain pressure in securing peace. I do not want to go into detail at the moment about the kinds of strategies that are currently being contemplated to put pressure on the Khmer Rouge and also to persuade it by dealing with such problems as it might realistically have. That is something that I will be discussing with foreign ministerial and other colleagues, including Mr Akashi, in Japan on Sunday and Monday. I will now be getting to the Tokyo conference a day earlier to enable some of these political discussions to take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our hope is that, with that conference and with continuing discussion and pressure emanating from the UN Security Council, and perhaps a graduated series of responses over the period ahead, plus the kind of bilateral pressure that can be directed towards the Khmer Rouge&mdash;particularly from those countries which have a long tradition of direct association with the Khmer Rouge&mdash;this situation can be contained and the settlement process can be put squarely back on track. I repeat: there is no cause for immense gloom or pessimism about the settlement process at the moment but, obviously, it is finely balanced at the moment, and obviously everyone is working very hard in a whole variety of different contexts to try to ensure that it does not break down.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply said four days ago that which is the logic of the whole situation. If the peace plan completely breaks down and is acknowledged by the participants to the Paris conference to have broken down, then there will be no choice in the situation but for the UN to leave. Its mandate will be unable to be implemented. It is a peacekeeping mandate. It is premised on the existence of agreement and it is premised on the existence of commitment to that agreement by all relevant parties. That is the logic of the UN intervention, and in the event of a breakdown the UN will have no option but to get out.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier in Question Time today, Senator Alston misrepresented me by linking me with the spurious Opposition Treasury figures on the employment impact of the SGL. He claimed that at a press conference earlier today I agreed that 45,000 jobs would be lost. I did not agree. I have never accepted the assumptions that the Opposition put into the Treasury modelling. Senator Alston and Dr Hewson have deliberately and wilfully embarked upon a scaremongering campaign to frighten the public. The fact of the matter is that the loss of 100,000 jobs was a worst case scenario based on assumptions by the Opposition that there would be no wages offset. The Treasury minute says:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>and it is not regarded as reasonable. As a result of our negotiations, SGL will be taken into account at any national wage case. I said that Democrat negotiations have halved the impact in the short term and have protected the positions of the 250,000 employees who work for employers with payrolls under $1m. If job losses occur, they cannot be laid solely at the feet of the SGL. The Opposition has lost this argument and it knows it. Voluntarism as an approach to retirement incomes policy is a failure. It is rejected by the Australian population. The editorials of most major newspapers agree with this and the Opposition&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>I get five minutes to do that. I think it is deplorable that this Government is not prepared to allow a debate on the most serious issue facing Australia at the moment: unemployment, and particularly youth unemployment. It will allow no longer than three-quarters of an hour to debate such an important issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise this issue particularly in relation to the two answers that Senator Button has given to me on this subject this week. The first answer was on Tuesday when I asked him what his Government was going to do about the record levels of youth unemployment&mdash;34 per cent overall according to the official statistics and up to 45 per cent in my State of South Australia. His answer to that was, `I am not going to tell you; I am not going to say what this Government's policies are going to be to address this appalling level of youth unemployment in Australia'. It was a totally unsatisfactory answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised the same issue again today and asked: `What is the Government going to do about the record levels of youth unemployment?'. What was his answer? Firstly, and in a most offensive way, he tried to suggest that the Opposition could gain some pleasure from such a national tragedy. It was highly offensive and contributed nothing worth while at all to the debate. Secondly, he had a swing in passing at the goods and services tax without recognising that the purpose of the goods and services tax is to enable taxes to be lifted off production so that jobs can be created in this country, so that business can once again expand, grow and create jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, he sought to attack the figures of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, to talk down the figures. It was the same strategy adopted by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) two days ago when, rather than face up to the consequences of his Government's policies, the recession we `had to have', and the consequences of that upon unemployment in this country which is now at record levels, he also attempted to talk the figures down. Those figures are what they claim to be. For the benefit of Senator Button, I will remind him of what the Assistant Statistician said on the ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program this morning:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The unemployment rate is defined as those who are unemployed as a percentage of those who were either employed or unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>The unemployment rate for young people under that definition, the always accepted definition in this country at the moment, is a deplorable 34.1 per cent, over one-third. As I said, in Victoria youth unemployment is 46 per cent on the official statistics; in South Australia it is 45 per cent on the official statistics. So rather than simply talk down the figures, the Government ought to face up to that reality and put some policies into operation. What does the Prime Minister say he will do? All we have got out of the Prime Minister is the suggestion that he will now call a youth jobs summit. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this side of the chamber we regard that answer as totally unsatisfactory: an appalling failure by this Government to stand by its responsibility as the elected government of this country. It has been a sorry tale that has continued for too long. There was nothing for the unemployed youth in the last Budget. There was nothing for the unemployed youth in the One Nation statement, which simply offered more tax cuts that were unfunded&mdash;in other words, further borrowings on the $150 billion that this country already owes. There has been nothing constructive and positive put down by this Government at all in answer to this tragedy. Instead, we get these attempts to attack us, to attack our policies and to talk about what happened in 1982 and 1983. Those opposite do not talk about what is happening today, that is, about these record levels of youth who are out of a job, who deserve to have the opportunity of employment and deserve to have a government in this country that recognises the extent of that tragedy and is prepared to implement policies that will give these kids a chance.

Our performance is that we have doubled school retention rates during our period of office; we have increased the number of university places to 113,000, and almost doubled the tertiary participation rate since 1983; and we have created, as I said in Question Time, the equivalent of 17 new universities in Australia since 1983. </PARA>

<PARA>All Australians will be appalled at what has happened in this chamber in the last half hour. The Government and its acolytes, the Australian Democrats, have stifled debate on the most serious, urgent and tragic problem facing all Australians today, which is unemployment. The problem is not just youth unemployment&mdash;although that is the important focus of what we have been talking about&mdash;but also the unemployment of two million Australians who either cannot find work or are unable to find satisfying work in terms of the number of hours they want to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All Australians would be appalled not only at the refusal by the Government and the Democrats to allow this matter of great national urgency to be debated, but also, if they had been watching Question Time today, at the disgraceful display&mdash;I can say it in no other words&mdash;that Senator Button gave in response to a question from Senator Hill on this matter, and at the response that Senator Cook gave to a question by Senator Sherry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button had the incredible arrogance to say that the coalition should not get, to quote his words, `overexcited about this situation'. Every Australian is pretty excited about this situation because not one Australian home or family is not touched in some way&mdash;most of them are affected directly&mdash;by the scourge of unemployment that Senator Button and his Government and its policies have produced. They are policies that the Government deliberately produced; which the now Prime Minister (Mr Keating), through his eight or nine years as Treasurer, deliberately pursued; and which have led to the greatest cost, hardship and recession that Australia has had since the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night the Prime Minister said that the youth unemployment figures were, `a distortion of, in fact, the position'. He tried to tell Australians, including kids in his own electorate&mdash;which he would have had the greatest trouble finding, no doubt, because it is years since he has been there&mdash;that the youth unemployment figures were distorted and that, far from youth unemployment being 34 per cent, it was only about 10 per cent. I cannot think of a more disgraceful attitude and action that any Prime Minister could take at a time like this in our nation. He knows that that is simply untrue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's official statistical agency is the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has an official definition of unemployment and official measures of the rate of unemployment. The Government's own statistical agency, the Bureau, says that the unemployment rate amongst 15- to 19-year-olds in Australia is 34 per cent. That figure is quite appalling. In my own State it is 46 per cent. In South Australia it is 46 per cent. If the Government does not believe those figures, it ought to tell its own official agency that it does not believe them and that they are wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote to the Senate the official agency's figures&mdash;the Government's own statistics&mdash;over the last two or three years. We now have 34.1 per cent youth unemployment in this country. Two years ago that rate was 15.8 per cent. When this Government took office in 1983, there were approximately 457,000 15- to 19-year-olds in full time employment. Today there are 253,000 15- to 19-year-olds in full time employment. In other words, during the period of this Government, full time youth employment has virtually halved; it has fallen by more than 200,000. There were 457,000 youth employed when we left Government in 1983; there are now only 253,000 full time employed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, we are debating a motion that Standing Orders be suspended to take note of an answer by Senator Cook. Senator Short put forward an argument very much like the one raised in regard to a previous motion to suspend Standing Orders in respect of an answer by Senator Button.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate has centred around the issue of unemployment. Much argument is taking place as to the figures which represent the true level of youth unemployment in Australia. I would have thought that any level of unemployment was a tragedy. The people who have been listening to the debates we have had&mdash;one has already taken place in respect of an answer given by Senator Button in Question Time, as well as the present one&mdash;would be concerned about the way that we, as senators in this august chamber, and I say that most seriously, are carrying on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think what Senator Coulter said in respect of the first debate is absolutely correct: there are particular mechanisms which our predecessors in this chamber set up to enable debate. I think&mdash;and I am probably in accord with most people in this chamber&mdash;that there ought to be debate, and very serious debate, about the issue of unemployment, whether it be amongst youth or older people. I think that debate should be informed and structured so that the people who listen to us have a purchase on the sorts of solutions that we put forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point about having an urgency motion or raising a matter of public importance is that it can be prepared. I think this is what Senator Coulter was saying. The procedures of this chamber are set up so that debate about very serious matters can take place in a very serious way, rather than somebody simply getting up at the end of Question Time and saying, `Look, a Minister has given a particular answer to a particular question; now let us have a debate'. This matter is one of the most essential matters that faces us as parliamentarians; it is one of the most essential issues that faces the Government and the community. It is wrong that that sort of debate should take place in an almost casual, ad hoc and unprepared way. </PARA>

As a result of that, we are seeing proceedings which are very disruptive to a proper debate about unemployment. I think that we, as a Senate, must call ourselves to order and start treating this issue not as an adversarial procedure whereby we can throw insults at each other across the chamber but start facing it squarely in the interests of those people in Australia, particularly our youth, who are suffering most grievously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make three points as we debate the motion to suspend Standing Orders. Firstly, I want to put on the record the fact that this is obviously a major problem facing this country; one that, no doubt from listening to Senator Cooney and previous Opposition speakers, everyone is aware of, concerned about and determined to do something about. However, when we look through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record for this year so far, we can see that in 31 sitting days we have already had 212 debates on this issue. The issue of unemployment has come up 212 times. It has been discussed and debated. One really wonders what we are achieving doing it yet another time in this very ineffective and inefficient way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only go back over some of what Senator Cooney has already said about urgency motions and MPIs where we do have an opportunity to prepare formal speeches and to put the matter back on the agenda. At this point I must remind Opposition senators that they are the ones who are complaining about the shortage of time; they are the ones who are complaining that we have had to restrict the amount of time we spend on each piece of legislation. Yet here we are now, one hour and five minutes after Question Time, and still we are nowhere near the stage of considering any legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to how we can actually achieve something in this place. It is not by yelling at each other, by throwing insults backwards and forwards across the chamber and debating ad nauseam. We can actually achieve something in this place by voting on legislation. When we eventually do get back to legislation today there is an excellent opportunity for Opposition senators to prove that they really are interested in young unemployed. They can do that by not supporting the Government, which is cutting yet again the amount that young unemployed people are able to receive by removing the access to a training allowance for under-21s. Opposition senators come in here and say, at length, that they are concerned, but when it actually comes to doing something, we are very close to calling them hypocrites. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am supporting the motion to suspend the Standing Orders so that we can have debate on this matter of urgency. Senator Lees has just put the most outrageous proposition to us. We have discussed youth unemployment at previous times, and now it seems we are being told that if we do not think about it the whole problem might just go away. That is totally unacceptable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeking to take note of the answer that was given today in the Senate by Senator Cook because there is obviously a concerted campaign which was begun by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) this morning. He knows that he cannot defend his record on unemployment, so he sets out to rewrite the figures; just as he set out to rewrite the history of Australia because he has a chip on his shoulder about our origins and about our flag. So now he wants to rewrite the official figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Vanstone set out very clearly what we are discussing; that is, 34.5 per cent of youth looking for work cannot find that work. That is a pretty simple definition. For the Prime Minister to have the temerity to come out and say, `Oh, it is not really all that bad; it is really only two in 10', is just a nonsense. To have Question Time used in a dishonest way with, firstly, Senator Button reiterating the statement and, secondly, a dorothy dixer designed so that Senator Cook could do likewise simply cannot be allowed to pass without being objected to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is something totally different from Senator Cooney's concept of wanting a structured, contrived debate, where the likes of Senator Coulter can send away for a speech from his speech writer and stand up and read it. That is one of the reasons why he is not agreeing to this suspension of Standing Orders; he was not ready to debate it because he had not had somebody else do the work for him. There are a lot of people here who get outraged and insensitive when people on the other side deliberately try to mislead the Australian people, and that is precisely what happened today. It is a well-known technique; it was well used by Goebbels. Perhaps we ought to call Senator Cook Senator Goebbels-Cook, the Minister for disinformation, to go with his title of the Minister for unemployed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button wants to try to be a smart alec by coming across with some other epithet. He is a great one for epithets.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Senator Button that there are a lot of people in this Parliament who have children of their own who would like to see that they have a future, not people who think that the problem can be solved by pretending that the figures are inaccurate and really that the Government's record is somehow worthy of upholding. In fact, the Government's record is deplorable: one million are unemployed and, of those one million, 34.5 per cent of young Australians seeking work are disbarred from working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is with the concurrence of these Democrats over here who apply the guillotine. That is with the concurrence and active participation of Senator Cheryl Kernot, who went around initially making all the right noises of concern about the superannuation legislation. But at the end of the day it was not a matter of if the Democrats would agree with the Government; it was a matter of when. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real question to be asked is: what was the deal struck in order that it would occur? I am not talking about the deal that we see that brought the levy down from 5 per cent to 4 per cent. What was the deal done that we are not told about? What was the coercion? It was not a question of if they agreed; it was a question of when. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have, courtesy of the Democrats and the Australian Labor Party, new legislation which will force a minimum of 45,000 Australians out of work. That is the figure that Senator Alston rightly used today; that is the figure that the Government and the Democrats pretended they were not agreeing with earlier. Now they say, `Let's not debate the issue here because it's even more embarrassing'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the merits of the case. The Government attempted to put out a line. Senator Button was the first advocate; Senator Cook was the second advocate; the Democrats were the backup team.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take Opposition senators back to 1983&mdash;a very good year. How many youth were unemployed? How many 15- to 19-year-olds were unemployed when the Opposition was last in power? Let me tell Opposition senators that there were a heck of a lot more. We have actually dropped the figure quite drastically. A reduction of about 21 per cent has occurred since we have been in power. These are the sorts of things that those opposite choose to overlook and neglect to mention. They should take more care with things like numbers. When those opposite lost power there were 157,600 unemployed teenagers. I am sorry that those opposite do not care to take note of this or believe these facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Treasurer (Mr Reith) keeps saying that nearly one-third of teenagers are unemployed. He does not seem to be able to understand that not all teenagers are actually out looking for work. A large number are still at school. In fact, there has been about a 100 per cent increase in the number of students staying on at school to improve their education; to actually use their education to gain experience and training and to broaden their range of scope, activities and opportunities for later on in life. It is now apparent that about 10 per cent of the youth are unemployed. That is in fact a lower figure than the general unemployment figure&mdash;something that those opposite do not seem to be able to comprehend. However, that is their problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our figure of slightly less than 10 per cent of youth unemployed compares with the previous government's figure in April of 1983 of 12.4 per cent of youth unemployed. Even those opposite should be able to understand those statistics. They are not terribly good at understanding statistics, but surely they can comprehend those statistics well enough to know that we have actually been able to do something about this particular issue. That is obviously not the case, though; they are rather slow learners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that we should in fact look at the Fightback program and what that is going to offer to youth. It is a whole 664 pages. The only attempt in it to address the needs of the at risk young people is a hollow statement about helping young people to make the transition from school to further training. There would of course be full fees at university, so no families on AWE or less would have any chance of their children actually being able to gain access&mdash;none at all. Instead of creating a new expanded system for vocational education and training as we are, those opposite are offering a one-off increase of $75m in 1993-94 for that area, and nothing else; nothing else for TAFE. They just want to discard it completely. That is not even enough to cover demographic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite, of course, are the same people who will abolish the dole after nine months and expect people to live on fresh air and water&mdash;they probably will not even be able to live on the water because that will be charged for as well through the 15 per cent GST as part of local government charges. A part of Fightback would slash spending for the labour market program area by $140m. A great help to the youth that would be. Those opposite would cut Jobstart wage subsidies by $62m&mdash;a further great start. They would abolish the self-employment assistance program. Wonderful people! They would amalgamate CES and DSS and contract out job placement services at commercial rates. Really and truly, how do they expect us to believe that they really care or have any real concerns about this particular issue? They are just here grandstanding.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a motion moved by Senator James Short for the suspension of Standing Orders to consider a response by Senator Cook to a question relating to youth unemployment. It is important, I believe, for the Senate to debate that particular answer because that answer attempts, unfortunately, in my view, to hide the real problem of youth unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever we do, whatever action we take, must be based on the facts&mdash;must be based on the truth of the matter. The truth of the matter, clearly, is that we have record youth unemployment in this country despite the number of young people who are hidden away in TAFE colleges, universities and, indeed, secondary schools who would otherwise very vigorously desire to be in the paid work force. So we do have to look at this situation. </PARA>

In fact, I did warn of the enormous social disruption and dislocation that would occur if policies were not put in place which would give the youth of this country a fair go.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to express my disgust at the completely inadequate attempt by the Government to address the circumstances of youth unemployment in this country today. The appalling attitude of the Government was displayed vividly in Question Time today by Senator Button, and also last night by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his response to what was happening in Bankstown. The Prime Minister, and Senator Cook in Question Time today, had to hide and try to play down the problem and declare that only 10 per cent of youths were unemployed. This was a crude distortion by Mr Keating of devastating statistics in an attempt to run away from the problem rather than addressing and correcting it. The stark reality is that only two out of 10 young Australians actually have a job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Youth unemployment was measured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in May at 34.1 per cent. Quite clearly, this means that, of all the teenagers looking for work, more than one in three are unable to find a job. This is indisputable, despite the fact that Senator Cook wishes to twist the interpretation of the ABS figures. However, this 34.1 per cent does not include the youths that are underemployed and those that have enrolled in training or education programs because they have no alternative but to apply for the Job Search allowance. It also does not apply to those who despair of ever finding a job and, therefore, are not even able to declare themselves as looking for work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From this, it can be seen that youth unemployment is even higher than the ABS is able to determine. According to the ABS, 14,500 Australian teenagers have stated that they are discouraged job seekers. This statistic is from September last year. Since then, we have had an entire year of school leavers enter the job market, and we do not know how many of these are going to end up in a situation where they despair of ever finding work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, in reality, youth unemployment is higher than 34 per cent. The problem of youth unemployment is not something that has suddenly occurred; the problem has been around for quite a while. But, while the Keating Government was intent on engineering the recession that we had to have, the youth unemployment figures exploded. In 1989-90, the youth unemployment figure was 15.8 per cent. In 1990-91, it had grown to 23.1 per cent and it now sits&mdash;conservatively&mdash;at 34.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is disgraceful that this Government can ignore the plight of our youth; the future of the country. It is a bit like Nero fiddling while Rome burns, and this Government should be condemned for it. The Government has not yet come up with a suitable response to the youth unemployment problem. That was completely obvious from the pathetic attempt by Senator Button to answer the question that Senator Hill asked of him during Question Time today. Senator Button did not even attempt to answer the question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the Government planning to do? Well, there has been a vague suggestion that there should be a youth summit; a belated attempt to address this issue. However, to date, the Government's major response has been to shunt our youth off into training programs and higher education institutions. The result of this action has not been very helpful. Our universities and vocational education centres are already overcrowded and underfunded. Squeezing more students into them without injecting corresponding funds only serves to lower the standards of higher education and vocational education in Australia. The other problem is that the Australian economy has been destroyed to the extent that this Government cannot provide the jobs that are needed for our youth.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Olive</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing in response to the interim report on the implementation of pharmacy restructuring measures, handed down on 19 December 1991 by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The interim report has focused on a number of specific issues. Broader policy issues arising from the interim report have been addressed by the Government in the course of the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eligibility Criteria for Essential Pharmacy Allowance (EPA)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee found the EPA administrative arrangements unnecessarily complex, disadvantaging some early applicants seeking the allowance. The Government has acted on this finding, to simplify administrative procedures by removing the requirement for an annual application for EPA, and providing early applicants who were disadvantaged with retrospective payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The removal of the annual application for EPA has provided additional security for the small business owner. Instead of the annual application, the onus will be on pharmacists themselves to advise the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) of changes in their eligibility status for the allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Applicants who applied for EPA before 30 June 1991 may have been disadvantaged by early administrative processing delays. This occurred despite the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority (PRA) holding extra meetings to cope with the large volume of applications. The Government has provided retrospective payments from 1 January 1991 to applicants who were disadvantaged. Administrative arrangements were improved from 30 June 1991 and no applicants seeking EPA have been disadvantaged by administrative delays from that date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unmet Public Need</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee raised concerns that applications for pharmacy approvals involving claims of unmet public need should be more definitive, in particular it was felt that a set of criteria should be established for applicants to meet in order to be recommended for a new pharmacy approval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government met with the Pharmacy Guild on a number of occasions in an attempt to develop more definitive criteria that might be used by the PRA in assessing applications claiming unmet need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite attempts to develop more definitive criteria, these were considered unsatisfactory as they tended to be so liberal as to potentially qualify every applicant for a new pharmacy or alternatively would be so strict that it would be extremely difficult for any applicant to meet the criteria. There was agreement, moreover, that the only way in which criteria could be developed which would be sensitive to the individual circumstances of particular towns or locations would be to investigate every potential pharmacy location in Australia, document the particular circumstances which influence patient access to prescription medicine and somehow incorporate these into a definite set of criteria. This is clearly not a practical option.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The paramount consideration in considering applications for unmet public need should be whether the absence of a pharmacy in a particular location creates intolerable problems of access by patients to the extent that health outcomes may be compromised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the basis of these discussions I wrote to the Guild and the Chair of the PRA reaffirming the principles of pharmacy restructuring and supporting the existing PRA Guidelines for assessing unmet public need. The Guidelines do not take the form of `hard and fast' criteria which the applicant has to meet but rather are a number of indicative questions, which encompass a range of considerations which influence whether there is a demonstrated unmet public need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lack of Appeals Mechanism to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the PRA was set up, no internal appeal mechanism was developed as it was envisaged that normal appeal mechanisms would operate including:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">lodging appeals with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">challenging the decision in the Federal court of Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">appealing to the Commonwealth Ombudsman.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the tribunal ruled that it had no jurisdiction in the area because of the wording in the Act. The Government moved to immediately amend the National Health Act 1953 to allow aggrieved applicants access to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The amendment was made retrospective to the date the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority commenced operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In concluding I would just like to reiterate that the initial administrative problems and processing delays occurring with the introduction of the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority have been addressed. The administrative processes are now measurably better and there are no longer delays in processing pharmacy applications. In addition, any significant policy issues which have emerged throughout your inquiry have been expeditiously addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I await the tabling of your final report due I believe on 28 April 1992.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As yet, I have not actually seen the report of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs on the implementation of pharmaceutical restructuring measures. Since I was responsible for moving the motion which led to the establishment of the inquiry by this Committee, I want to say a number of things. I thank my colleagues on the Committee and I pay tribute to the staff of the Committee who worked enormously long hours on a report which actually grew as time went on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tate said at the time that such an inquiry was unnecessary. The Committee found a large number of problems associated with pharmacy restructuring. A significant problem was that pharmacy restructuring was based on a press release. No guidelines were given to the officers responsible for implementing the pharmacy restructuring. So it was not clear what was meant by `prior financial arrangement'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pharmacy restructuring program sought to reduce the number of pharmacists. There were limitations on when a pharmacist could get a provider number. If it had been established that a pharmacist had entered into a financial agreement with, say, a developer of a large shopping block before a certain date, that was taken as evidence that an arrangement had been entered into and the person would be given a provider number. Following a date which I cannot remember, people were limited and maybe not able to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee uncovered some not-so-proper interactions or exchanges of documentation. It also found that a number of people had been disadvantaged financially; in fact, some of their livelihoods were threatened. It was also found that the implementation of this had not been terribly well thought through. For example, the officers were operating on a press release and not on guidelines, which was totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a warning to every other profession which gets into bed with the Government and wants an arrangement made to have that profession restructured&mdash;radiologists, pathologists and other groups. The lesson is that there are inherent dangers in the Government trying to plan with, for example, the restriction that a pharmacy cannot open within a certain distance of another. Senator Walters brought up the case of a pharmacy in her State which wanted to open up, but the 30 kilometres was down a very long, winding road. Thirty kilometres in a hilly area in Tasmania might be very different from 30 kilometres in another area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues that this Committee has been looking at are very broad. I remind honourable senators that it was implied by the other side that this was totally unnecessary, and that this Committee has had to have an extension of time to investigate and look at these issues. As I said before, it is a warning to professions. If they want the Government to organise things, they might find themselves in the pickle many pharmacies found themselves in as a result of pharmacy restructuring. I look forward to the presentation of the full report, as this is only an interim one, and will speak at more length then. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to speak briefly to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth Procurement Guideline No. 8: Managing Risk in Procurement</EMPHASIS> put out by the Department of Administrative Services with regard to managing risks in procurement. One of the basic attributes of any business is its ability to purchase. The Federal Government in fact spends some $10 billion on goods and services each year, and just a plus or minus 10 per cent movement in that figure means a plus or minus $1 billion in either savings or additional expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the observations I have made in the shadow portfolio of administrative services at the various forums I have been to is that probably the best purchasers that the world has seen for many years are the Japanese. It is a lesson to go to Japan to see how they carry out their purchases. They carry them out effectively without an awful lot of nonsense or bureaucracy. Their purchasing system is a cooperative effort. They like to see a big spread of suppliers, even to the extent where, in some instances, additional moneys are paid for commodities to keep the number of suppliers large, rather than limited to a few, so that they do not end up being caught in the pincers of a monopoly or duopoly or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that have happened in recent times within the Government concerns risk management. The chart on page 20 is a little horrifying, because it indicates that there will be an incredible increase in the bureaucracy of various departments. One of the things this Government has done is to go into financial management improvement programs, which I believe is absolutely correct in principle. I think it falls down, however, in the purchasing area. In both the public sector and the private sector&mdash;and it does not matter which we are talking about&mdash;good purchasing people are a very rare commodity. The Government has split these people up so that the central purchasing group within DASET&mdash;and I am no centralist by a long shot&mdash;has to a large degree been decimated. I think it is a big mistake. I think we need to have a central purchasing group which should comprise, de facto, a member of each department, so that it can coordinate purchasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time left to me I would like to refer briefly to common use contracts, which have been basically destroyed. They are of no useful purpose to anyone these days. To a large extent, this has been caused by the Minister who intervened in the famous Nashua case. Honourable senators might recall that a limited list of people was prepared for common use contracts in the computer consumables area. The Minister intervened and put one of the unsuccessful tenderers back on the list. The only way the Department could get the Minister off the hook was to go from six or seven people, who were initially successful, and put 22 people on the list. This is absolutely ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government wants to go down the route of having acceptable tenderers, that is fine. But the way it sits at the moment, being on the successful list in respect of a common use contract guarantees nothing. All it means is that one is on a list and one can then negotiate with the various departments and sell one's wares. People who have tendered under these conditions have said to me that it is an absolute waste of time and energy because they are quoting twice. They say that it is not workable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that should be drawn to the Senate's attention is this ongoing pain in the neck of unlimited liability in regard to IT purchases. The One Nation package made reference to this matter. But this reference was very woolly. We were not told which way the Government was going to go, only that it would be looked on an item by item basis. Of course, because of the Government's buying power, unlimited liability conceivably could mean that the suppliers of a $100 item could find themselves defending an action by the Commonwealth for tens of millions of dollars. That is utterly unsustainable. It does not occur in the private sector. I believe that the Government must look at this matter fairly quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to another matter that is totally unacceptable. I know that the Government believes it can put up Chinese walls. The Department itself is going into partnership with other private sector people. It will be quoting to itself. It believes that it can put up so-called Chinese walls and divorce itself from the tendering processes as against the decision making processes, and that every effort will be made to be at arm's length. No-one in the community will believe that, if the combination of the Government and a private sector group is successful, the decision will be above board. I believe that the Department should not be involved in this sort of thing; it should get right out of it altogether. I think things like propriety and probity are more important to the Government in its role of purchasing essential goods and services. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth Procurement Guideline No. 8: Managing Risk in Procurement</EMPHASIS>, is not really significant in terms of content. Without being unkind, it is rather light and inconsequential from that point of view. But the interesting thing is that the Government feels it is necessary to reinforce some of the principles that we have had for years with respect to tender assessments and the procurement of goods and services by the Government. There certainly is a very great need for that because the Commonwealth, particularly under this Government, has slipped badly with respect to guaranteeing the integrity of the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are dealing here with not only the expenditure of public funds but with all the things that precede it&mdash;things such as the calling of the tenders, the registration of interests and the assessment of those bids to ensure that the process has been fair and accurate. The Government must guarantee to the limits of its ability that there is absolute honesty and integrity in this process. It must be like Caesar's wife&mdash;it must be beyond suspicion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two fundamental reasons for this. We live in a democratic society and we live by a rule of law. The community observes that rule of law on a voluntary basis. In a democracy we are not compelled to obey the law; we do so out of respect for the common good. It therefore follows that the public must respect the administering authority&mdash;that is, the Parliament. Particularly in relation to funds, the Parliament is given the right by the community to tax and to levy charges from the community. The other side of the privilege, if it could be called that, of levying taxes is that the Government must be beyond reproach in the disbursement of those funds. That point must always be emphasised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another aspect to the whole business of tendering. Companies dealing with the Commonwealth are often involved in tenders that run into hundreds of millions of dollars, and even larger at times. They invest man years of work in the preparation of those tender documents and, for a major contract running into $200m or $300m, the cost of preparation of a tender by a company might well be of the order of $1m. That is big money. The expenditure of the money does not guarantee the right to win the contract, but it should carry with it the right to a professional assessment. That should go without saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are occasions in the past, and currently before this Government, where that professional assessment has not been made. As I said earlier, there has been a slipping of the processes which have been set in place for the last 30 years in this country for the assessment of major contracts. </PARA>

I have expressed these views to Senator Button in the chamber before. When this Government entered into its corporatisation program&mdash;which was a program designed to take certain business functions of the Government out of the control of the Public Service wage structure&mdash;it failed to address the other areas of safety which had been built into Public Service procedures over many years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have pointed out that those safety measures were adopted by Liberal-National Party governments over the 1960s and 1970s, no doubt at the very strong pressure of the Labor Party Opposition which would have been complaining about the nature of contracts that government departments were entering into. In order to demonstrate that government departments were entering into contracts on a fair, proper and reasonable basis, over a period procedures were developed to ensure that safety precautions were built into the procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Commonwealth procurement guideline is another similar safety precaution. As my colleague Senator MacGibbon has pointed out, what should have been statutory authorities, but which are now statutory corporations, have been taken out of the control not only of the Commonwealth Public Service wages structure, but also out of these procurement guidelines and such safety measures as the Auditor-General has in relation to government departmental procurement arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Civil Aviation Authority is a perfect example of the way that these sorts of things have gone wrong as a result of the Government's corporatisation program.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on Monday, 15 June about the use of personal computers within the Commonwealth Public Service. What bothers me about a guideline such as this one that we are debating here today is that it does not cover what is happening currently. It talks about checking up on things after they have happened. This article says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, the public service is moving to the position where there is a PC&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>I ask Senator Button to address this matter and to come back some time in the fairly near future and tell the Senate whether the Public Service has adopted this procedure. If it has, it is a total waste of money for everyone to have a PC sitting on his or her desk. The Public Service ought to be using much more efficient methods; for example, a small typing pool with a very good word processing system which is able to take dictation from those people who need to express themselves in writing. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to endorse some of the remarks made by my colleagues Senator Parer, Senator MacGibbon and Senator Lewis. This whole area of government procurement is very important. Over the last few years, there have been major changes associated with the development of corporatisation of many functions of government and also with the introduction of the financial management information program. The whole theory has been to allow managers to manage within the public sector better than they have been able to before. In the process of moving away from the fairly rigid centralised controls that existed before over various areas of management activity&mdash;in particular, procurement&mdash;we have lost some of the checks and balances that did formerly exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that a number of serious concerns have been expressed about developments in recent years. Let me hasten to say that I am not arguing against the movement that has occurred in management practice. I think it is going in the right direction. But, in that movement, some of the checks and balances that previously existed have been lost. I am not sure that there is a lot of confidence out there&mdash;particularly in the private sector which might be supplying to government, seeking to sell product to government&mdash;that the new procedures and the new controls of checks and balances are adequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is a matter, as Senator Lewis said to Senator Button&mdash;I hope Senator Button will respond in due course&mdash;of which we need to take greater account than we have in the past. Some examples which have caused concern come readily to mind. There was the Nashua issue of a year or so ago when Senator Bolkus, as the Minister for Administrative Services&mdash;</PARA>

There is also the matter that has attracted a lot of attention in recent days in this chamber and outside, and that is the deal that has been done in relation to the construction of the new building of the Australian Labor Party which will be the site for the headquarters of the Australian National Audit Office, opposite the National Press Club. An exceptionally good deal appears to have been worked out there so far as the Labor Party is concerned. That is a matter that, quite rightly, has raised several very serious concerns, not just on this side of politics, but more generally.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had the complete shambles, at best, in relation to the CAA-Thomson air traffic system contract, and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to all of that I just want to make the point that the key elements in any procurement system must, first, include accountability. We are talking about taxpayers' money so, secondly, there should be value for the taxpayers' dollar. We must have open, transparent and clearly defined processes which are not able to be manipulated or distorted, so that the potential avenue for any fraud and dishonesty can be eliminated. Of course, the bottom line is efficiency, effectiveness and integrity. I am not suggesting that those things are not there at the moment, but the changes that have occurred in recent years have given us cause, or need, to look at those systems of procurement again. I hope the Government will do that. The coalition, on coming to government in a few months time, will certainly give that a high priority. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>This report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Audit Report No. 40 1991-92&mdash;Efficiency Audit&mdash;Department of Social Security: Systems for the Detection of Overpayments and the Investigation of Fraud</EMPHASIS>, is 165-odd pages long. Since it was only available during lunchtime, about two hours ago, one cannot always do justice to such a report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I felt it necessary to speak on the report today because it deals with an efficiency audit of the systems for the detection of overpayments and the investigation of fraud within the Department of Social Security. In defence of the Department of Social Security, the Australian National Audit Office has found that on the whole considerable efforts have been made by the DSS to address the problems associated with its accountability activities. It also needs to be pointed out that data-matching, which the Department considers to be a very important mechanism in identifying fraud and incorrect payments, was not fully operating at the time of this particular audit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this report the Audit Office has seen fit to make a number of disturbing observations about the fraud control systems and procedures of the Department of Social Security. First, it was found that the DSS fraud control plan and the draft of the revised plan had been prepared without the benefit of a comprehensive statistical analysis of the incidence of incorrect payments and fraud. The Auditor recommended that high priority be given to developing a revised fraud control plan based upon a comprehensive, statistically based risk assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Auditor found that DSS does not have a comprehensive program of random sampling by which benchmarks can be established for the incidence of incorrect payment, and risk based review work can be assessed. The Auditor recommended that the DSS develop benchmarks of the incidence of incorrect payment, by which the outcomes of risk based review work can be assessed. In its comments, the Department refused to accept this recommendation on the grounds of the strategic impact that data-matching will have with regard to random sampling. From my knowledge of the auditing and statistical analysis procedures entailed in DSS data-matching, it would appear that the Department's response in relation to this matter is understandable. I hope that the data-matching process will result in the establishment of accurate benchmarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the Auditor found that DSS management information systems are not utilised effectively for the management of fraud prevention, detection and prosecution. In particular, it was found that DSS management information systems and management practices do not ensure consistency in accountability between regions. The Auditor recommends in his report that DSS utilise its management information systems to ensure consistency in accountability activities between regions. In responding to the Auditor, the Department has claimed that it has long been committed to developing management information systems and an effective overpayment review system, and has replaced the suspected overpayment facility. In addition, a new debt management and information system is also being developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly&mdash;and I consider this to be probably the most important point&mdash;the Auditor found that there were large variations in accountability between regions and that there is no adequate management investigation to establish the reasons for such variations. These large variations in accountability outcomes include measures such as the proportion of reviews undertaken, the proportion of downward adjustments made as a result of reviews, the average amounts of overpayments identified, the proportion and amount of debts written off and the average amount of overpayment for cases referred for prosecution. In order to overcome this problem, the Auditor recommends that DSS management information systems be used to ensure consistency in accountability activities between regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is vitally important that recipients of DSS benefits receive equitable treatment no matter where they reside in Australia. The charter of the Department of Social Security is `to deliver social security entitlements with fairness, courtesy and efficiency'. Adherence to the principles of fairness and efficiency must apply to all the Department's operations, including the collection of overpayments, the writing off of debts and the conduct of reviews.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor has found that the number of overpayments recorded was proportionately smaller in the larger States&mdash;1.3 per cent in New South Wales, compared with 2.9 per cent in South Australia. The Auditor also found that the average value of recorded payments tended to be larger in the larger States&mdash;$1,084 in New South Wales, compared with $594 in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think most of my colleagues in this chamber would agree that it seems hardly fair that a person in one State is able to escape repaying an overpayment for a longer period than a person in another State; nor is it fair that DSS would place greater emphasis on chasing larger overpayments in certain States and not in others. Not only is it not fair, but also those people who accumulate a large overpayment, sometimes through no fault of their own&mdash;not through fraud&mdash;are then faced with a very large debt. If it is followed up earlier in one State than in another that means that some people face debts that accumulate over a longer period of time. There are two ways of looking at whether this is fair. I am arguing that there should not be regional differences; that, as far as possible, the processes of the Department ought to operate so that people are treated equally across the States and regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its response to the particular finding of the differences across regions, the Department has claimed that the variations in accountability outcomes are not as significant as portrayed by the Auditor and that there is no evidence to conclude that external variables are not responsible. I believe that the matter of DSS recipients receiving equitable treatment, regardless of their place or State of residence, is one that cannot be so easily cast aside by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor found that had DSS reviewed the same proportion of beneficiaries in the larger States as in the smaller States, an additional 200,000 reviews would have occurred resulting in additional savings to the taxpayer. This is a significant variation that I believe cannot be attributed solely to external factors. I trust that the Department will give due recognition to this important finding from the Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Auditor found that DSS had no comprehensive program of quality assurance checks by which the appropriateness and method of discretionary decisions in accountability work can be assessed. It was recommended that a national system of randomly selected quality assurance checks be introduced throughout the DSS accountability process. The Department has responded that regional office assurance processes are in place and that the work is proceeding on the enhancement of these processes, as well as their extension to area office accountability processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend this Audit report to the Senate. I look forward to the Department of Social Security promptly addressing the deficiencies in the accountability processes which have been identified by the Australian National Audit Office, particularly those which refer to differences across regions and States. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was speaking on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1992, the Social Security (Family Payment) Amendment Bill 1992 and the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 before lunch. When I was interrupted I was making my third point that the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill will amend the eligibility criteria for Job Search and Newstart allowees to ensure that new arrivals are not eligible for support where a sponsor is willing to provide the applicant with support, it is reasonable for the applicant to accept that support, but he or she elects not to do so. The coalition supports this amendment which will reduce the administrative costs entailed in the assurance of support system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to new arrivals, this Bill will ensure that only New Zealanders who intend to stay in Australia permanently can receive special benefits. Again the coalition approves of this change, particularly in light of the fact that there has been an 82 per cent increase in special beneficiaries over the last five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another change contained in this Bill is a decision formally to remove the training component of Job Search allowance for beneficiaries aged under 21. Earlier this year, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal found that allowees aged under 21 were eligible for the FTA. The SSAT decision was confirmed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in May this year, resulting in a situation whereby up to 50,000 young people may have been eligible to reclaim their unpaid training component. This Bill will reinforce the Government's policy of not paying the training allowance to under 21-year-olds on the grounds that it acts as a disincentive to undertaking secondary and tertiary education&mdash;and the coalition is supporting this initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill contains a number of other minor amendments, including the attribution of a $2,000 income-free area for deeming; an extension of the pensioner assets test to sale or lease-back arrangements, mainly in relation to nursing homes and retirement villages; provision for the lodgment of some reviews at CES offices; and the inclusion in the Social Security Act of the common law right of privilege against self-incrimination. All of these changes are minor and are supported by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill provides for a number of changes to social security data matching, the most important of which is the introduction of what is referred to by the Department of Social Security as `positive data matching'. In layman's terms, this means that the Government will be able to use its data matching facility to identify people who are eligible for but who have not claimed benefits. Those who remember the data matching legislation in 1990 will realise that this positive data matching has a quite different objective to that originally put forward by the Government for its extended use of the tax file number; that is, the prevention of fraud and the rorting of the public purse. I will speak further about this matter at the committee stage of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second Bill being debated is the Social Security (Family Payment) Amendment Bill 1992. This Bill will restructure the payments made by the Department of Social Security to families with children. While the coalition supports these changes, as they will reduce some of the poverty traps faced by sole parents and low income families, it needs to be pointed out that they are largely cosmetic and certainly nowhere as comprehensive and far-reaching as the family assistance measures contained in the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this Bill, family allowance will become the family payment, and the family allowance supplement will become the additional family payment. The components of income support paid to DSS recipients in respect of children will be separated from the pension or benefit and integrated with the family payment. To provide a more even spread of income support, the family payment will be paid during the alternate week to that of the fortnightly payment of pension or benefit. All child add-on payments will now be paid to the primary care-giver. Rent assistance will become part of the family payment. Guardian allowance will be extended to low income sole parents receiving the additional family payment, thus providing greater incentive for sole parents to return to the work force. The child add-on component of a pension or benefit will now be subject to the more generous family income test rather than the pension or benefit income test. The maintenance income test will apply only to the additional family payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Students still at secondary school who are over 16 and ineligible for Austudy will continue to get the family payment until they leave school or turn 18. DSS beneficiaries who return to the work force will automatically receive an application for the additional family payment. Finally, the additional family payment will continue to be paid during non-payment periods, such as benefit waiting periods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In stark contrast to what I said have been largely cosmetic changes, a coalition government will substantially reduce the burden borne by millions of Australian families under Labor. When we win government, the Liberal and National parties will implement the largest ever tax cuts in this country's history, with taxpayers paying, on average, 30 per cent less in income tax. That is a point that is always forgotten when people mention the GST. Family allowance will be doubled for families with combined incomes under $30,000 per annum, while families with combined incomes between $30,000 and $40,000 per annum will have their family allowance increased by 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A coalition government will increase the dependent spouse rebate by $300 per annum for eligible families with children and with incomes under $50,000 per annum. A coalition government will also provide an additional $90m for increased child-care support, while an additional $50m will be given to voluntary agencies to the benefit of many families currently suffering financial and social hardship under Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of housing, the first home owners scheme will be reintroduced, and first home owners with incomes under $40,000 a year will be eligible for $2,000 assistance. In addition, the coalition will allow young Australians under 35 to withdraw up to 75 per cent of their superannuation savings to be put against the purchase of a home. A coalition government will also introduce a tax-free savings scheme whereby the first $1,000 in new savings income will receive a 30c in the dollar tax rebate. People will also be able to make rebateable superannuation contributions on behalf of a working spouse. These are only some of the substantial benefits which Australian families will derive from the coalition's Fightback package. While the initiatives contained in the family payment Bill are unarguably a step in the right direction, it is easy to argue that they are negligible in comparison to the massive benefits for all Australian families which will occur under, and which are contained in, Fightback. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend to the Senate the speeches by my colleagues Senator Newman and Senator Patterson. I believe that they have covered more than adequately the very significant legislative changes that have been enshrined in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill, the Social Security (Family Payment) Amendment Bill and the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill. Therefore, the only reason that I rise to speak at this point is to formally move the amendment circulated in the name of the Opposition by way of a second reading amendment, which draws formal attention to the matters just canvassed by my colleague Senator Patterson.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As she stated, the measures that will restructure and rename the family allowance and family allowance supplements are a step in the right direction; we acknowledge that. We recognise the greater degree of equity and balance that will arise from that restructuring. Nonetheless, we think it is essential that the Australian community be made very much aware of the derisory One Nation, pre-Wills by-election gimmick of a one-off payment which went out, as I recall, under the name of the Department of Social Security with all sorts of gratuitous references to the generosity of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). We have since discovered from surveys that it was simply dissipated to many families struggling to make ends meet in the way that one would expect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the contrast that the Australian electorate has between the Government's token gesture and our very substantial $1 billion family package, which offers a doubling of family allowances for families with incomes up to $30,000 and a 50 per cent increase for families with incomes up to $40,000. We are also offering a whole range of other taxation incentives and payments, particularly a massive one-third reduction in personal taxation arrangements totalling about $13 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government, which used to like to pride itself on somehow genuflecting in the direction of lower and middle income earners, seems to take the view these days that the old constituency does not matter any more. The Government is only interested in the fast end of town. As we recall with age pensions in the One Nation statement, the Government was not even prepared to offer tax cuts for those on incomes of less than $20,700. At the moment, those people are on a marginal tax rate of 20c in the dollar. Under the Fightback proposals, that rate will come down to 16.2c. </PARA>

The answer was basically, `That mob had it pretty good during the 1980s. It is about time we moved on and tried to find some votes elsewhere'. That is the sort of callousness that underlies the Government's approach to families and low income earners.

Without going into the reasons in any great depth at this stage, I indicate that our position on this matter has been seriously considered after the Depenbroeck decision in the AAT. The advice I have is that there is great potential for expenditure of some $4m as a consequence of the amendments that have just been moved by the Democrats. The Department of Employment, Education and Training is concerned to closely align the level of support available under what was the formal training allowance with Austudy provisions, and as part of the keenness to ensure that alignment we do not support the Democrats' amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have very little time to raise an issue that I think is of basic importance and ought to be raised. In 1990 we saw an amendment to the Social Security Act. This brought in the use of data-matching and the extended use of the tax file number, which Mr Keating had promised us would not be used for any other purpose than taxation. The tax file number was extended and that was justified on the basis that welfare cheats and rorters on the public purse would be caught, and over $300m would be saved each year through data-matching.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that situation, we were damned if we did and damned if we did not. We had a huge inquiry into data-matching. I remember that people on the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs&mdash;and even I&mdash;asked, `What is going to happen? The Government will come to us and say that it has yet another reason for extending the use of the tax file number'. Here we have it in this Bill. Again, we are damned if we do and damned if we do not. We are now data-matching to find people who are eligible for a benefit but are not in receipt of that benefit. It is going to cost the taxpayers to the tune of $100m a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no objection to people who are entitled to a benefit getting it, but it is this slow chipping away at the stone of the extension of the tax file number for what appear to be very justifiable reasons that I object to. Of course, we are in a situation where we cannot disagree with it; we have to abide by it.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bring to the attention of the Australian public the fact that the use of the tax file number is now being extended again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that concerned me was that the Department of Social Security intimated that it did not need to amend the Act to do these positive data-matches. I directed a question to the officers of the Department&mdash;and they got legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department&mdash;as to whether amendments were required. The answer was equivocal. The Attorney-General's Department said that while it may appear that the legislation that is currently drafted permits the data-matching program for positive aspects, the issue is not free from doubt. Its advice, therefore, was that the proposed amendments to the Data-Matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act to allow positive data-matching should proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is quite different from the advice that I received. Earlier in the debate I asked Senator Tate whether I could have leave to table the legal advice I received, and he gave that permission. If Senator Bolkus could extend that to me, I would appreciate it. The legal advice I got on data-matching was definitely that the Act specifically said that it was negative for those people who are rorting the system, not for those people who are entitled to a benefit. My concern is that the Department had what I call a soft interpretation of the Act&mdash;that, yes, it could do the data-matching for positive effects. That is the risk. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it a package of four sizeable Bills: the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1992; the Telecommunications (Public Mobile Licence Charge) Bill 1992; the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992; and the Aviation Fuel Revenues (Special Appropriation) Amendment Bill 1992. It is outrageous that the Parliament, particularly the Senate, the House of review which picks up so many of the mistakes that the electoral college&mdash;the other place, the House of Representatives&mdash;makes in legislation, is denied its basic function because of the incompetence of this Government to manage its affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice the Labor Party Whip is smirking because he has the security of the guillotine to drive his legislation through per courtesy of the Australian Democrats, those great custodians of public morality&mdash;the people who get up when I go to lectures in Brisbane, to universities and things like that and nauseatingly carry on about how they support the Senate because it is the House of review and it works in the interests of the people of Australia. How can we work as a House of review when the Democrats, the far left of the Labor Party, are bought off to support a guillotine? Without exception, every session we have had since this Government has been in power, they have sold out the legislative rights of the Senate in order to satisfy the need for the Government to get up by a specific time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we started this session, as you would remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, we just made work for weeks and weeks because the Government was so incompetent in organising its legislative load that we had nothing to do. Now we have something like 38 or 40 Bills to put through in two weeks&mdash;driven through without any due deliberation, any fairness or any review, which was supposed to apply to that legislation, purely because the Government and the Democrats think that is the way to govern Australia in the best interests of the community. No wonder the Parliament is held in contempt and parliamentarians are the lowest in social standing when behaviour like that goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have four major Bills before us this afternoon. None of us have time to go through them in the detail that they demand. The first Bill that I want to deal with is the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1992, which deals with shipping and maritime amendments. In essence, these non-contentious amendments concern the extension of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority services, a change to the schedule of hazardous substances, the implementation of the MARPOL Convention requirements for the disposal of untreated sewage, oil, chemicals and garbage in the Antarctic area and the correction of some drafting errors&mdash;errors that had the Senate had time would probably have been picked up on earlier occasions when the Bills were first presented. The two areas of pollution in the Antarctic and, indeed, the matter of AMSA's capacity to do its job with the resources currently at its disposal should be the subject of concern in this chamber because of the international implications that are attached to that. They certainly should be the subject of greater debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also some communications amendments. The amendments made under the Transport and Communications Amendment Bill to the Broadcasting Act of 1942 and the Radio Licence Fees Act of 1964 are contained in parts 3 and 4 of the Bill. The amendments do not relate to the future of the industry in policy changes or as a response to technological advancement. Rather, they involve a correction of errors and anomalies which have occurred because of amending legislation moved through this Parliament in the immediate past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments seek to recognise the radio warrant for an AM commercial radio service and can either authorise medium frequency transmission only or medium frequency coupled with high frequency. The effect is to ensure that licensees of non-metropolitan AM commercial radio who have FM translators will be able to apply under subsection 89D of the Act for a conversion to an FM licence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Radio Licence Fees Act 1964 are contained in part 4, clauses 21 to 25, and are all concerned with licence fees. Again, these amendments concern correcting a drafting error in an amending Bill passed last year. The current licence fee ceiling of 6.5 per cent for licensees with revenues greater than $10m should in the 1991 amending legislation have been reduced by 50 per cent or to 3.25 per cent. That was the Government's original intention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also contains the mechanism to ensure that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal refunds to affected licensees the difference between the amount which was paid and the amount which should have been paid. The Opposition will be moving an amendment to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) also amends communications Acts, specifically the Telecommunications Act of 1991. The amendment is to allow exception to the rule which prevents a carrier which dominates a market from discriminating between customers to enable AOTC to implement its decision to offer a concession to low income and other disadvantaged customers. Secondly, this Bill seeks to allow exceptions to the rule which requires all basic carriage services to be set out in a tariff. The effect of this will be to allow some confidentiality of information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third telecommunications related Bill is the Telecommunications (Public Mobile Licence Charge) Bill 1992, the purpose of which is to provide clarification on a couple of matters in relation to a third national mobile telephone system. These matters concern the licence charging regime, which cannot be construed as a tax, and enable the third mobile operator to provide such a service on the same terms as MobileNet and Optus, which are the two existing operators. The Bill also provides that in the future, where further licences are allocated, the charge is to be in accord with regulations and not necessarily by tender, as is the case with the issue of the third licence. The issue of a third mobile licence is in accord with independent advice to the Government from Austel, and is also in accord with the Opposition's policy of providing greater competition in this field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendments I wish to deal with concern the aviation measures in this package of legislation. The three Bills propose amendments to, first, the Air Navigation Act of 1920, the Federal Airports Corporation Act of 1986, the Civil Aviation Act of 1988 and the Aviation Fuel Revenues (Special Appropriations) Act of 1988. The final Act in this group is amended by the changes to the aviation fuel excise levy. The Aviation Fuel Revenues (Special Appropriations) Amendment Bill attempts to reconstruct the formula under which a portion of the revenue received by the Government from excise and customs tariff duties on aviation gasoline is appropriated to the Civil Aviation Authority. The Bill will reduce the excise by 1c a litre immediately, with a further 1c reduction to apply when the number of Commonwealth airports is reduced to 100. The full sum will be reduced with the termination of the aerodrome local ownership plan in June 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Government announced its intention to transfer the remaining Commonwealth owned aerodromes to full local ownership, the original date for the phasing out of the plan was 1994. However, an additional $25m was provided under the One Nation statement to bring the phasing out date forward to 1993. This Bill allows for a reduction in the rate of excise to correspond with the reduction in Government outlays for the ALOP. The Opposition will not be opposing this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nor will the Opposition be opposing the amendments contained in the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. In essence, this Bill replaces the existing general offence provisions in section 22 of the Act with specific offence provisions and penalties; clarifies the position relating to international airline licences, permissions and approvals; amends the regulation making powers of section 26 to enable regulations to be made enabling on the spot fines for specific offences; and removes the power to prescribe a term of imprisonment in the regulations. These changes are all contained in clauses 3 through 15 and are, in the main, just administrative changes. The Australian Democrats have proposed an amendment to this Bill and the Opposition will be opposing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third transport related Bill in this package is the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), which amends 10 Acts three of which fall within the aviation area. These amendments enable ratification of two new protocols amending the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation to increase the size of the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the Air Navigation Commission. Secondly, it specifies that the CAA and FAC cannot be reimbursed for financial detriment as a result of complying with ministerial directions relating to its environmental functions. Thirdly, it clarifies the priority of the CAA's statutory liens and, finally, it ensures that the FAC has the power to enter into a number of financial management risk or hedging transactions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will not be opposing the second reading of this Bill. However, it will be opposing clause 15, which seeks to amend clause 78 of the Act to ensure that liens over aircraft have priority over other financial security interests, including pre-existing mortgages. Our opposition to this attempt to gain priority over other creditors is based on the belief that, firstly, the CAA already has sufficient power to recover debts and, secondly, it certainly has more than enough power over the aviation industry without this sort of nonsense. There is a possibility that leasing charges will be increased if the priority of the CAA to recover debts is strengthened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to say something about the airport local ownership plan and the consequences of the user pays doctrine that this Government has applied to the aviation industry but to no other transport industry. I was very interested to see about four weeks ago that the Canberra bus service had lost something like $2.7m. I phoned up the ACT Administration and got the full account. I found out that the $2.7m was the loss after it had had a subsidy of something like $54m or $56m. Then I found there was an Auditor-General's report saying that the ACT Government's accounting processes were a bit shonky. I totted up a loss of something like $58m-odd for the bus service in this little tin-pot town. Where is the user pays principle in that? Why are we driving the aviation industry, which is of major significance to the Australian economy, to a cost recovery, user pays system, yet we have something like the bus service in this town losing over $50m a year? It is absolutely nonsensical. In my city of Brisbane something like $22m a year is lost on the urban bus service. I could not quantify what the railways lose; it would run into hundreds of millions a year, maybe thousands of millions a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But somehow or other this Government has locked the aviation industry into a user pays, full cost recovery doctrine. An awful lot of penalties come from that program. I would argue quite strongly, as I have over many years, that there is a public interest component in the aviation industry. The community benefits. It not only benefits through the tourism industry with all the people that that employs and all the money that it brings into the country from tourists and people moving around the country, but also little communities&mdash;the isolated townships in rural Australia&mdash;have got an airfield somewhere. These have been supported in the past out of the consolidated revenue paid by the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that the local ownership plan has been tightened up, a lot of those shires and small townships which entered into the scheme, most of them somewhat reluctantly, find that they cannot maintain the airports. We are not talking about anything grandiose here. We are talking about maybe a sealed strip and a little wooden hut as a passenger terminal, but those airports provide a very effective facility for those rural people. During floods and fires and all the other vicissitudes of the bush aircraft are able to go in and provide relief supplies. A lot of those places find that they simply cannot afford an airport. I would argue that there is a community interest. We are one country; we are one nation. I think that we ought to provide a basic level of benefits across the country, and that is very relevant with respect to aviation services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter I would like to comment on briefly is the mess that the aviation industry is now in as a consequence of the Civil Aviation Authority. I spoke earlier this afternoon on accountability in relation to the tendering documents on procurements that were laid down in the Parliament today by the Department of Administrative Services. We now have a Civil Aviation Authority which is almost totally devoid of the professional competence that is needed to run its business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I woke up this morning I heard on one of the news reports on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Radio National</EMPHASIS> an allegation that the Civil Aviation Authority had said that all the light aircraft in this country were dangerous or something like that because maintenance was not being kept up. The President of AOPA, Mr Peter Petroni, said that was nonsense. There was a direct quote from him. Of course it is nonsense. I do not know what the statement was from the Civil Aviation Authority that initiated all this, but the maintenance of aircraft is very tightly covered by the Civil Aviation Authority. If there is any shortcoming there, it is as a consequence of maladministration within the Authority itself. It is not the fault of the industry. The industry operates to maintenance schedules that have been in place ever since aircraft were introduced into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some changes recently in the system where the Authority has gone to manufacturers recommendations and things such as that. But for an authority to make such a claim, which can only alarm the public, I find quite nonsensical and irresponsible. In the fullness of time, I will research that statement and find out where it came from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is indicative of the low level of professional competence there now is in the Civil Aviation Authority. A large part of that stems from the contract basis where people are brought in who have no experience or knowledge of the industry at all. They are put into senior positions on contracts of two, three or four years tenure and told to save money. These people not only have no knowledge of the industry; they have no commitment to it and, least of all, no commitment to Australia and the industry within Australia. I sense that Senator Collins will interject here. </PARA>

I will be brief on each of those Bills, beginning with the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. This Bill encompasses amendments to each of the following Acts: the Air Navigation Act, the Broadcasting Act and the Radio Licence Fees Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of those amendments, the Australian Democrats acknowledge the basic administrative nature of most of the tidying up and questions of interpretation and clarification that exist with regard to the amendments to the Broadcasting Act and the Radio Licence Fees Act. We support those sections of the Bill as they are before us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we do have something to say about that section of the Bill which deals with the Air Navigation Act, and we will be moving amendments during the committee stage in respect of that section. The amendments in the Bill before us replace the general offence provision with specific offence provisions and penalties. The area that really concerns the Democrats is the proposed amendments to section 19 of the Act covering the carriage of munitions. In basic terms, our concern arose with regard to the fines and penalties that are provided for by these amendments. I propose to go through our reasons for the amendments and the nature of the amendments in this second reading debate so as not to delay the chamber in committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have proposed that increases be made to the fines and penalties that are in this amending legislation. In discussions with the Government over our proposed amendments, which basically tighten up the penalties and fines with regard to the carriage of munitions, we ascertained that it was the intention of the Government at some point in the future to deal with what it saw itself as some inadequacies in this legislation. We persisted with our concerns. We came to agreement on the basis that we support the intention, but believe that this is the time that we should bring the penalties and the code of offences to a better and more appropriate standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the amendments that we are moving embody a very important principle of justice: that the punishment must fit the crime. We believe that the criminal offences defined in the Act must be liable to terms of imprisonment and fines which give a clear signal of the Government's intent to pursue regulatory control of aviation, particularly with regard to munitions trafficking, which we consider to be very serious indeed. I note that a major review of the legislation is planned with regard to public safety and breach of licence issues, and look forward to those future proposals. But in regard to the carriage of munitions, we felt that it was important to have the ability to impose criminal penalties, and we have persisted with those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that an amendment will also be moved by the Government to that section of the Bill that deals with the Broadcasting Act, which relates to the Government's legislation on political advertising. The Democrats will be supporting that Government amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second Bill before us is the Telecommunications (Public Mobile Licence Charge) Bill 1992. This Bill embodies provisions for the new allocation system, including consideration of Australian equity and industry development commitments. We certainly acknowledge and support this move; in fact, the Government gets brownie points for this one. However, I wonder whether the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) will be advising the Senate, as a matter of course, about prospective bidders. How wide will his information gathering about the bona fides of the prospects in this area be? We understand that under this legislation the new system will be designed to cut government administrative costs and provide government income from a presently low taxed source, without which it may be possible for local fixed phone revenue to subsidise call rates for mobile phones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the process for the third licence, it is worth noting that all licences are up for review in 1995. Procedures for bidding and allocation terms and conditions will be revised then. The Government's idea is to let the market settle as we move into competition in this area, and then assess the new needs. I suppose the whole industry, and the Government legislation that surrounds it, is on trial, so to speak, at this time. The Democrats support this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) is again an omnibus Bill dealing with a wide range of issues. Part 9 involves substantive reform in the business of tidying up the house, which most of these omnibus Bills do. I note that part 2, relating to the Air Navigation Act, ratifies the Chicago Convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 9, which follows on from part 8 dealing with the Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Act and incorporating resolutions of the Maritime Environment Protection Committee as part of a pollution control protocol, embodies new requirements for emergency procedures&mdash;shipboard oil emergency plans, which we believe are excellent. The Government is to be commended for these guidelines which will go part of the way towards helping to prevent another <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> incident, we believe, where major problems were involved&mdash;as have already been discussed in this chamber, and no doubt will be again in the future in that situation&mdash;including delay in requests for help and lack of emergency procedures to ensure speedy redress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for foreign ships to be presented to port authorities on entrance and the need for alignment with standards mandated for Australian ships. The Australian Parliament&mdash;not this chamber but the other place&mdash;is embarking on a committee inquiry into the question of ship safety. I believe that inquiry will make a major contribution in this area internationally. Those of us who have an interest in this area will watch with keen interest the work of that committee which has already called for submissions, which submissions have attracted international attention and interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that in part 10 of this legislation copyright protection is being provided for the Austel name and symbol. A good deal of this legislation clarifies the corporatisation and general changes that have taken place in transport and communications under this Government. For instance, part 5 deals with the corporatisation process of the Civil Aviation Authority, its liability to pay tax, and the CAA to be considered as an entity under tax law. The Australian Democrats have no amendments to this Bill and support its passage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth Bill before us is the Aviation Fuel Revenues (Special Appropriation) Amendment Bill. This Bill reduces excise but preserves the revenue entitlement of the CAA. As Senator MacGibbon has already noted, the Bill relates to the local ownership scheme and to the tightening up of that scheme for locally owned airports. The revenue forgone is the revenue used to fund the previously Commonwealth owned aerodromes. The transfer of ownership of local aerodromes occurred in August 1990 by regulation. Through this legislation we are passing on the savings to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to make the point that local aerodromes are of major significance to local communities and to note, with some surprise and almost incredulity, Senator MacGibbon's protest about the application of user pays in the area of aviation. I find that extraordinary from a proponent, presumably, of the Fightback program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator MacGibbon did say something with which I heartily agree: that we as a community through Consolidated Revenue should provide a basic level of services to those in far flung places in this one nation of ours. Having come from a small country town whose aerodrome was a focal point&mdash;it was an air base during the Second World War, which I can barely remember, of course, having been born halfway through it&mdash;I know how important those airports are to local communities. As a senator representing the whole State, I very often find myself landing and taking off from some of these very basic air facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A matter of great concern to the Democrats is the application of this deregulatory process and the Government getting out of one service or another to the community. It has been a feature of this Labor Government which is avidly supported by the Opposition, whose only complaint, until I heard Senator MacGibbon just now, seems to have been that the Government has not done enough soon enough, and that more will be done when Fightback becomes government policy after the next election, should the coalition win office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local aerodromes in rural communities are more than simply somewhere for fly-boys to land their planes and for senators to visit. There are important safety and access issues involved for local people, from local disasters or problems that relate to individuals or single families, right through to major bushfires, floods or whatever. Equal access for rural people is important in a social justice sense. Anything that any government does should do nothing to add to the disadvantages that already exist for those living in rural and remote Australian areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that government intentions are stated and that some action is already under way to upgrade the airports&mdash;in many cases, they are already completed&mdash;before hand-over or commitments to those upgrades. That is a plus. The acknowledgment of that social responsibility is maintenance grants from the Government and an ability, as part of the One Nation statement, for the local bodies to apply for funds under a social benefits funding scheme. My only concern is how long all of that will last, particularly if there is a change of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should there be a change of government&mdash;when local communities will feel isolated as a result of a user pays program, which I am sure will become absolutely brutal should such a thing happen&mdash;I look forward to hearing from Senator MacGibbon in defence of those local communities as avidly as we have today. In that event, I will refer any correspondence I get to Senator MacGibbon. Perhaps he will be the Minister for aviation support at the time. No doubt he hopes he will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have no amendment to that legislation either and will support its passage. We will merely move amendments to the first Bill dealing with the penalties involved in the carriage of munitions in air transport. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I will. I will not spend too much time speaking on the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill. I intend to be finished by 6.30 p.m. The main purpose of this Bill relates to the Broadcasting Act. The Bill makes it possible to ensure that the licensees of non-metropolitan AM stations and commercial radio services which have FM translators will be able to apply for conversion to FM. The other main change relates to radio licence fees. The full benefit of early arrangements made by the Government&mdash;the reduction in fees for the radio industry itself&mdash;will flow on to where it is needed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate does not need me to tell it that radio is having a bad time around Australia, particularly in regional and remote areas, so any flow-on of a reduction in fees will be very much appreciated. The reduction of fees may save some bases. However, if some do not amalgamate, they will see the end before very long, especially if the recession lasts much longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few minutes left before dinner, I would like to address the issue of fees for two-way radio licences. There has been a reduction in AM licence fees in regional areas but, for two-way radio licences, the fees seem to have been going the other way. In fact, the fees for HF two-way radio licences were fairly static until about 1987 when so much was paid for a base and so much for a mobile. When Senator Evans was the Minister for Transport and Communications in 1988 it was decided that an FM transmitter on a base should be licensed according to the number of channels, which more than doubled the radio licence fee of a base. The Government increased the licence fees on HF mobiles as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a base that had three or four mobiles the bill for one year went from about $300 or $400 to over $1,000. That might have been all right in 1988 when the recession was not as deep as it is now. However, I would like the bases to be treated the same as the broadcast radio stations in rural and regional areas, which have had a big reduction in their licence fees. Previously, if a base had a flying doctor network in its HF channel it was able to avoid sales tax on the set. That provision was also eliminated in 1988. It made the cost of communication, and safety, in rural and remote areas much higher. I believe it is an oversight by the Government that it did something for the broadcasting sector of radio for regional areas but did nothing for two-way radios, which are very important in terms of safety. I would like the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) to take this on board and see what he can do about reducing licence fees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 deals with changes in radio licence fees for country FM radio licences. It is interesting that the Government should attempt to involve itself further in the FM radio licences after the unusual circumstances surrounding the granting of FM radio licences in the northern New South Wales town of Lismore. I think the Senate will agree that the Government must be questioned on its ability to handle even minor issues in this area after hearing the points that I wish to raise tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate the issue of the granting of an FM radio licence to serve the northern New South Wales town of Lismore. I do this so that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) may provide answers to some very important questions. Over four years ago the Government announced a plan to introduce a new commercial FM radio service in Lismore. The then Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Evans, said at the time that Lismore could look forward to receiving a new, independent FM radio service by early 1990. The Minister went on to say that Lismore was in the market such that he would `dismiss any supplementary licence applications'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hearings commenced for the granting of the licence with two applicants for it and the current AM radio station, 2LM, being able to cross-examine and offer a submission as an interested party. After waiting for relevant decisions from the Federal Court, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal decided that the licence should be awarded to a syndicate named Northern New South Wales FM Pty Ltd in December 1989. A legal challenge was then mounted asking for a re-hearing of the case. This was eventually granted. After further legal proceedings, the re-hearing was set down for 9 March 1992&mdash;almost 2 1/2 years later. Before the re-hearing the ABT member had to satisfy himself that the Lismore market could support an independent licence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, we were debating in a cognate manner a number of transport and communications Bills. Part of one of these Bills makes reference to radio licensing. I was discussing a rather unusual position in the town of Lismore and the way in which FM radio licences hearings have been conducted over several years. I was pointing out that it had taken almost four years for this matter to come to its final stages&mdash;or so we thought. Then some very unusual interventions seemed to lead to a position where a whole new ball game was opened up. After we had legal proceedings and re-hearings, a date was set down for 9 March 1992, almost 2 1/2 years after this matter got under way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the re-hearing, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal members had to satisfy themselves that the Lismore market could support an independent licence. This was found to be the case on 17 December 1991. The local AM holder, 2LM, objected, for the second time, on an allegation of apprehended bias, but this was thrown out of the Federal Court on 6 March 1992. On the same day, and only three days before the final hearing of this four-year saga, the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Richardson, told the ABT that an application for a supplementary licence was coming and asked whether, if possible, the ABT would hear the application simultaneously with the current proceedings. As an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lismore</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Echo</EMPHASIS> of 22 May 1992 put it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, 2LM was allowed to apply after all. Suddenly someone had moved the goal posts.</PARA>
<PARA>The supplementary licence was lodged by 2LM but, for some unexplained reason, the then Minister, Senator Richardson, never passed it on to the ABT which said that it would have to consider it if it received it. As the ABT had not received the application by 9 March 1992, the ABT hearing went ahead. On 13 May 1992, the Tribunal decided that it was, in fact, non-viable to have another independent radio licence in Lismore. This was despite two decisions to the contrary, one only five months previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the duty of the ABT to issue further licences wherever possible, unless it considers that the current service would not remain adequate. The report of the Tribunal on its decision gives no satisfactory reason why the ABT should change its mind between December and May. Only nine days later, the ABT announced that it was commencing hearings on the granting of a supplementary FM radio licence. It had received an application from 2LM on 19 May 1992 on a referral from the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Richardson, only six days after the ABT had rejected the granting of an independent licence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circumstances surrounding the granting of an FM radio licence in Lismore have been extraordinary, to say the least. On 5 May in this place I questioned the then Minister, Senator Richardson, on his involvement in this issue. I received a most unsatisfactory answer. He stated that because of the way the Act was drafted, there was almost no chance of a supplementary licence getting up, but that once the Australian Broadcasting Authority was established by legislation which was then before the Senate, supplementary licences would be much more common. He also stated that he feared for the economics of country radio. I remind the Senate that the ABT had ruled twice that in Lismore the market was able to support two radio licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABT cites television aggregation as a new factor that affects the viability of radio in Lismore. Television aggregation has been expected for at least two years. How is it, then, that the ABT, only now, after four years of hearings, decides to take this into consideration?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins, must clear the air unequivocally and investigate this matter. I would like the Minister to provide answers to several questions surrounding this whole issue of the granting of licences for FM radio in Lismore. I should like to know why the former Minister intervened in the way that he did; specifically what circumstances changed between December 1991 and May 1992 to make the ABT change its mind on viability; whether Senator Richardson's correspondence with Mr Westerway, Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, was one of those factors; why 2LM's application for a supplementary licence was held up for so long in the former Minister's office; and why the ABT has called for submissions to the new hearing into supplementary licences without waiting 28 days for the appeal period on the last decision to lapse. The ABT has not been expeditious to date, so why is it endeavouring to be so now?</PARA>

When I first came to this portfolio there were some 27&mdash;I do not want to be held to the actual figure because it was several years ago now, but I think that is right&mdash;airstrips on privately owned pastoral properties scattered all around Australia that were being maintained at public expense by the Commonwealth in the Budget, for no better reason that I could discover than they had simply been there the year before and they just kept being funded recurrently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to how they got on the list originally, I was not interested enough to inquire. But one does not have to be too smart to work out how privately owned cattle station airstrips received public funding. I thought that was totally inequitable and could not be sustained. I support the Government's move, but that Government move has been tempered by the concerns that Senator MacGibbon raised and it has been funded to the tune of $63m to help alleviate the situation for those people in the bush. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be supporting in committee the Democrat amendments in terms of the concerns they have raised with us about the inadequacy of the penalties provided. We think those concerns are reasonably based and we will support those amendments. We will be rejecting the Opposition amendment in respect of liens on aircraft for a very substantial reason. I must say that I certainly expect an amendment from Senator MacGibbon in respect of anything the CAA does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty with the amendment is this: the CAA has to have this kind of control. It is in a position that none of the other people with whom airline owners operate are in. For example, if a fuel company has a difficulty collecting its bills from an aircraft company, it simply discontinues supply of the product. That has happened, as Senator MacGibbon knows, and it happened recently in the case of a major national airline. It is a very obvious thing for a company to do if another company is not paying its bills. The same thing applies with lease payments to aircraft owners and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAA cannot do that because the CAA provides a safety service. The CAA cannot withdraw the services of its air traffic controllers; it cannot withdraw the services of all of the people it employs to ensure that an aircraft is in a safe condition to fly. It is simply not in a position to exercise those same controls over bad debts, which can in fact pile up to an amazing degree in a very short time if they are not paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, the majority of aircraft operators in Australia are responsible about those charges and pay them promptly. The difficulty is that if they are avoided it simply leaves all of the honest and scrupulous operators in the industry who do pay their bills to foot the cost of carrying the people who have defaulted on their payments. So the imposition of these liens is reasonable in terms of collecting debts for an organisation that is not in a position to simply withhold its services if people do not pay for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has always been the situation in respect of the position of liens. Some doubt has been raised in some legal circles&mdash;although not in the majority of cases&mdash;as to the position of these liens. These amendments are required simply to put the matter beyond any doubt. They do not change the current position on liens. They are there for a very sensible reason. We will be opposing that Opposition amendment and supporting the Democrat amendments. We will also be opposing, for both technical and philosophical reasons, the amendments circulated by the Opposition in respect of precluding political parties having radio licences. </PARA>

<PARA>These are mechanical amendments that are consequent upon the substantial amendment circulated to clause 19 of the Bill which I will move at the appropriate time, but I will speak to these amendments now. The amendments are a consequence of a review of the definition of `commercial viability' as a result of a submission received from the Law Council of Australia. They will remove any potential uncertainty associated with the present definition. They will clarify the period the Tribunal must take into account when considering the commercial viability of existing overlapping licences during an inquiry into the grant of a new licence. The present definition limits the Tribunal's consideration of commercial viability to the time of expiry of the existing licence which, in some cases, could be only a few months. Complexities could also arise when the Tribunal is considering several overlapping services with different expiry dates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We propose that the definition of `commercial viability' be amended to allow the Tribunal to consider whether, on the balance of probabilities, an overlapping service will continue to be provided under the existing licence for a period of five years from the date the Tribunal decides to grant an additional commercial radio licence. The five-year period is comparable to the period for which licences are granted and the definition is capable of being administered with certainty. I conclude by saying that the amendments are a positive response to the submissions made by the Law Council of Australia and I seek the support of the chamber for the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to rise to speak on the Wool Tax (Nos 1-5) Amendment Bills, the Wool Tax (Administration) Amendment Bill and the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), particularly the Wool Tax (Nos 1-5) Amendment Bills and the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2). These Bills provide a mechanism for distributing surplus Australian Wool Realisation Commission funds, collected as wool tax from growers, back to woolgrowers in the form of lower tax and introduce more flexibility into the current debt reduction arrangements. There are also minor amendments to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act 1977 and to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act 1949.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a repeat of a very similar situation 12 months ago when, in the dying stages of sittings, we had a guillotine debate, similar to tonight&mdash;a very restricted time available for debate on one of the great Australian industries, the wool industry, at a time of particular difficulty for that industry. I accept that it is the greatest Australian industry in the history of this country and that a tax was to be imposed on it. It was also the baptism of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, to primary industry. I think he had reason then to question some of the legislative and administrative problems that he had inherited from the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the wool industry at that time there was a stockpile of over 4.6 million bales, basically a year's production, and a debt of $2.8 billion. There was a debate as to what level of tax would apply to woolgrowers of Australia who were looking forward to a significant reduction in their income because of the removal of the reserve price. They were suffering because of the drought that was then covering much of the wool growing area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government was originally proposing a 15 per cent tax. The Opposition said that a 10 per cent tax was adequate to cover the situation. Eventually the Democrats voted with the Government and a 12 per cent compromise was reached in the Senate. While the industry agreed to 12 per cent, it believed that 3.5 per cent would be used for promotion, 0.5 per cent for research and development and 8 per cent for debt repayment. However, some of the participants from the industry and the Australian Democrats were not aware that the Minister was going to reduce the promotion levy from 3 1/2 per cent of that 12 per cent to 2 1/2 per cent, which in turn has now caused problems with finance for wool promotion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time there was a very severe drought across much of Australia which, as was known at the time, had led to reduced production either directly because of the drought or indirectly because it was no longer of cost benefit to purchase the supplementary feed necessary to keep many of the sheep alive and producing. So for this financial year we have a production of somewhere between 744 and 750 million kilograms of wool. That is well down from the record production of earlier times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also a situation where the wool textile pipeline&mdash;the wool going through the wool processing system&mdash;was basically empty because of the uncertainty that the wool textile industry was facing with regard to price and availability. Since that time there has been a better than anticipated clearance from the stockpile of about 100 million kilograms of wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debt reduction from the original $2.8 billion will certainly be under $2.4 billion by the end of this financial year. The auction price has moved up and is very close to 600c a kilogram. I commend the Australian Wool Realisation Commission for the way it has handled with its policy the disposal of the stockpile in that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have the forecasts from the Australian Wool Corporation for the coming year. It is saying that production will continue to fall to about 730 million kilograms and is anticipating that sales from the stockpile could be 50 per cent higher, that is, up to about 150 million kilograms of wool from about 100 million kilograms for this current year. It is even estimating that the price will be slightly higher at about 620c a kilogram clean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this means that, basically, the operating costs of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission for storage, interest charges and all other charges of some $374m have been covered. The $20m initial debt repayment has been covered and there is about $300m left. In addition to that, in looking forward, the total costs will fall from $374m for the current year to about $260m next year. So if there is only a 2 per cent reduction in the total tax, which will cost about $54m, the Wool Realisation Commission already has enough to meet its costs for the coming year and it is already below the debt reduction requirement for 12 months time which was $2.559 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, there had to be greater flexibility in the debt repayment schedule so that the earlier than anticipated debt reduction could be credited against later years; otherwise the industry would be faced with the second best proposition of investing its surplus at a lower interest rate than it had been forced to pay through the outstanding debt. The Minister's response came through the One Nation statement of the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, in which the Government indicated it had agreed to flexibility in the debt repayment schedule. I commend the Minister and the Government for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, both the industry and the coalition were quick to point out that at a cost of several million dollars it would be costly to administer; it would be a clumsy system. Anybody who has been involved with these systems before, whether in the wool industry, the horticultural industry or any other industry, knows that it would not be a clean thing administratively. When one considers that every one per cent reduction in that wool tax is worth about $1,000 to an average wool grower with about 5,000 sheep, one can see that it is a significant factor in survival. Wool growers this financial year, according to the Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics, will have a loss of $46,000&mdash;their worst year in the history of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the shadow Minister for primary industry, Bruce Lloyd, has put it to the Minister that there is absolutely no reason why the tax for the forthcoming year has to be any higher than 9 per cent because of those figures that have already been indicated, and because all the costs necessary for this coming year have already been covered. When one takes into account the projections of the Wool Corporation for the coming year, one realises that even 9 per cent is a very safe and conservative figure, and that an even lower figure would be responsible. Some of the views put forward by members of the wool industry have certainly indicated that much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to the Government and to the woolgrowers of Australia that if reducing costs is the most fundamental way of ensuring survival, the coalition's Fightback package is of value. Even the Minister has not disagreed with the Treasury calculation of savings of over $1 billion a year to Australia's farmers. The figures we got from the Department are far more accurate than the Minister's off-the-cuff figures. There will be an average saving of over $8,000 per year per farmer, a tremendous saving to people who are hard pressed. The Treasury document, which is the Government's own document&mdash;it is not the Opposition's&mdash;shows that there would be further savings of $177m a year in the textile industry and $139m a year in the clothing and footwear industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other part of this legislation makes some amendments&mdash;there are some other factors, but this is an important one&mdash;to the arrangements for the annual meeting. I acknowledge that the Minister had this Bill under way ahead of the meeting in early May, which indicates once again some of the unhappy legacies that he had to deal with and a recognition that it was not going to be the most successful annual general meeting that could take place. That has been proven to be the case, which is unfortunate. I believe that the new Wool Corporation has been doing a good job in restoring confidence in the industry. This has been an unfortunate and unnecessary blow to that rebuilding of credibility and confidence with regard to the peak industry organisational body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the changes are to allow registration for a three-year period. That seems to me to be sensible, because there were real problems with timing for the first AGM, when I think about 8,000 out of a potential 60,000 woolgrowers actually registered. There will be the opportunity for broader accountability in future AGMs beyond the restrictions to no confidence motions concerning the AWC and debate on the level of the wool tax. More general items to provide that broader accountability will be allowed. That seems to me to be sensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will be supporting this legislation. However, I question the cost benefit of the big PR-type annual meeting which has been best, or worst, exemplified in the meat industry with the AMLC meeting. Although the wool meeting has not cost as much as that, there are claims that it has cost $400,000.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One should not be forcing some sort of overall model on all industries. I question whether what is being maintained in this legislation&mdash;that is, the single AGM-type meeting&mdash;is the best way to have accountability in the wool industry. There are a number of other ways of doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One way that seems worth investigating further&mdash;my colleague Bruce Lloyd has had some discussions with the industry, and we presume the Minister is having discussions with the industry also&mdash;is that if we have only one meeting per year somewhere in Australia, because of the size of Australia we will have real problems in having an equitable spread of membership attending that meeting. Therefore, we will have great proxy battles. Smaller, less costly meetings in two or three geographical parts of Australia would seem to me to be an alternative that is at least worth exploring. </PARA>

The first amendment affects the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Act 1977, and will allow the evidence of analysts to be given in certificate forms to courts. Currently, the certificate fails to establish that the substances which have been analysed were those found in possession of the accused, seized and passed on to the analyst for analysis. This means that the analyst has to attend court to give evidence in support of other witnesses. </PARA>

There is room within Australia's great industry to encourage the development of a range of production, processing and marketing models. This can only be to the advantage of the industry. </PARA>

This sector has also developed a unique cooperative marketing system. We believe Australia would be well served by an expansion of this system of producer-owned cooperatives, which would encourage local ownership, local loyalties and local buying. Niche markets would be far better catered for. These Bills definitely improve conditions for Australia's woolgrowers and the Democrats will be fully supporting them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of the Democrats' interest, and the interest expressed by Senator Lees on behalf of Senator Bell, I expected them to speak for much longer. Here we are once again with a wool Bill before the Senate, as is usual at this time of the year. It has happened every year since I have been a member of this Parliament, and probably as long as Senator Ray has been in this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am in a position to say, `I told you so last year'. Half a dozen of my colleagues said they could tell the Government so last year when we were debating whether the maximum rate of wool tax would be the 12, 13 or 15 per cent that the Government wanted. We told the Government time and time again that, because of the way the wool was flowing out of the stockpile, there was no need for anywhere near that 15 per cent tax rate; that rate would send every woolgrower to the wall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has neglected the wool industry. When Mr Kerin was Minister for Primary Industries and Energy he ran around the world telling people about the wool scheme, or whatever it was called. It is so long ago that I have almost forgotten the name of it. He ran around and told the rest of the world that the price of $900 was ironclad. The Australian Wool Corporation kept buying and buying. What annoyed me was that the benefit of all that buying at high prices was not going to the average woolgrower, the grower producing the 21 micron wool. The very fine wool was bought from places like Tasmania for 1,100c or 1,200c. This wool could have gone onto the market but it did not, and we finished up with a stockpile of very fine wool. The broad wool was being grown in areas where they should have run cattle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system went broke and we were left with $4m worth of debt. Therefore, we had to restructure the industry. We said that we could do without that 15 per cent tax; 12 per cent was ample. We did the figures, but Senator Cook, who was representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Industry (Mr Crean) in this place, would not listen and we finished up with a compromise situation. The Australian Democrats caved in. That is nothing unusual for them at this time of the year. They cave in every time the Government puts the pressure on. However, what the Government did not tell the Democrats, and it did not tell us&mdash;we would be the last ones it would tell&mdash;or the woolgrowers, was that by decreasing the tax from 15 per cent to 10 or 12 per cent, it was robbing 1 1/2c from the promotion side of the industry, which of course suffered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The International Wool Secretariat started jumping up and down about that because it could see that its funds were being cut. I am generally in agreement with my colleague in the other place Wilson Tuckey, the distinguished member for O'Connor. He has always said that the IWS has been a little over-funded and a bit too smug about its position, and that it could cut a bit of its own fat off its operations. For example, it had 1,000 people working in one building in Melbourne who never handled one bale of wool. We expected the fire to come up from the IWS. It kept going on its own merry way in relation to spending, and now it can see its funds running down. That is why it is very concerned. That was the deal that the Government did with the Democrats, but it did not tell them that it was taking funds away from promotion. So the Democrats were sold a pup like the rest of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now in the position that we said last year would happen, with production coming down. Normal production in the high days of the late 1980s got up to about 900 million kilos around Australia. The reason it was that high was that this wool reserve price scheme was holding up wool where it should not be. It did not send out market signals to stop production, and so on it went. That put the pressure on. As soon as the reserve price scheme was done away with, production came down. Production also came down because of the unfortunate drought in the eastern States last year&mdash;in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria&mdash;and parts of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brought production down to around 720 million kilos of wool for the year, which was a drastic reduction. No-one really knew how many sheep there were in Australia, but it was between 180 million and 200 million. I believe it is now down to 150 million. As I said, production came down because of the price and the drought. It also came down because the traditional beef growing areas on the edge of the wool areas, which became involved with sheep because it was profitable as the reserve price scheme held wool prices up too high, have gone back to their cattle, or growing coarse grain or something like that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year we put the Government in the picture about the way to go. Unfortunately, neither the Government nor the Democrats have much experience in the wool growing game, except for Senator West, whose brother drives a truck carting wool which gives her the right to speak on wool. She may know something about the game, but we on this side of the chamber do know about it. Senator Cook knows very little about it, and Mr Crean unfortunately comes from near Melbourne port rather than the wool growing areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year we reckoned that a 10 per cent wool tax was enough. Our figures have proved, production has proved and the prices have proved that that was ample. We are now in a different situation. Having done better last year with prices and clearances, we can now afford a wool tax of less than 10 per cent. I believe that it could be in the 8 to 9 per cent range to give the average woolgrower a little more profit margin. Last year woolgrowers had a negative income, but with a certain reduction in wool tax, they could at least break even. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Reynolds may like to hear that as it may help woolgrowers in Queensland. I believe that with these results a wool tax of 8 or 9 per cent would be sufficient. The reduction in production and the increase in prices and clearances means that, basically, the $374m operating costs of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission for storage, interest charges and all other charges have already been covered. Senator Tambling did mention those figures in his opening remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $20m initial debt repayment has been covered, leaving about $300m remaining. That means that expenses for a whole year are covered. Looking forward, we see that the total cost will fall from $374m, because there is less wool on hand for this current year, to $260m next year. If there is only a 2 per cent reduction in the total taxable cost, about $54m, the Wool Realisation Commission will have enough money to meet its costs for the coming year. In other words, as well as having the funds to meet its costs for the coming year, the Wool Realisation Commission will also receive funds from the wool tax. That amount is already below the debt reduction requirement for the following 12 months of $2.559 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those brief figures show the present position of the Wool Realisation Commission. Some of those benefits should be passed back to the farmers. They have cut their production by running fewer sheep as a result of the drought and the non-producers have been culled&mdash;in other words, production is now cheaper. I believe the benefits should be passed back to the farmers to help them return to having positive incomes. So much for figures, and so much for telling the Government where it went wrong. By its silence, the Government has admitted it is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look to the future. Although we have progressed part way down the track from where we were last year, there is still a long way to go. We have to recover from the damage done by Mr Kerin and the greedy section of the industry through having kept the reserve price scheme for far too long. We now have to go the other way. This stockpile will not disappear overnight. I can see it lasting for at least five years, on the best estimates available now. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we have a long way to go. When I was in eastern Europe last year I could see there was a market for a massive amount of our wool which could be used in the outdated wool mills there. With a tripartite deal with Australia producing the wool, Poland and Czechoslovakia providing the person power, and Japan or Italy with the know-how and high technology providing the machinery, woollen garments could be manufactured in eastern Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we are short of time, I will conclude by saying that we support these Bills. After all, the main thrust of the Bill is only to increase the maximum rate of tax for carpet wool from 4 to 6 per cent. Honourable senators will remember that last year carpet wool producers in Tasmania were given a special deal. Let me remind the Government and the Democrats of the blunder they made last year when they did not agree to the 10 per cent rate. Although they did not do it then, they should at least take the opportunity this year to return something to the growers by setting the rate at between 8 per cent and 9 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If ever there was legislation that need not have been brought into and gagged through the Senate this week, it is this package of legislation consisting of the Wool Tax (Nos 1-5) Amendment Bills, the Wool Tax (Administration) Amendment Bill and the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill. If only the Government had listened to us when we were debating the wool levy legislation this time last year, there would be no need for this legislation. At that time, the Government was pushing for the woolgrowers to pay a 15 per cent levy. We went through the dreadful debacle of the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, facing a crisis and wimping out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister told the international markets that the floor price would remain at 870c a kilogram clean. He then reneged on that promise. He went overseas and told all the markets that Australia would maintain the floor price but would bring it down to 700c. He went through Europe and Japan and gave his word as a Minister of this Government that the floor price would remain and that it would not go below 700c. Meanwhile, the Opposition was saying that the floor price had to go. Because the Minister had already diddled the market and broken his promise to the market, the buyers really did not trust him. Some of the buyers were forced to buy wool at 700c, but those who did not have to, who had enough stockpile, hung off because they did not trust the Minister. After all, he had just told them that the floor price had stayed at 870c a kilo. When he changed it to 700c, those who had been forced to buy at the highest figure were the Japanese because they had got rid of their stockpile and were being forced to keep their mills going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Mr Kerin once again broke his word and got rid of the floor price altogether, the Japanese buyers in particular demanded compensation. They said that they had trusted the Minister's word; after all, he was a Minister of the Government of Australia, and surely his word could be trusted. When he broke that word, the Japanese buyers yelled foul and wanted compensation. But, of course, the Government would not give compensation. We could not have afforded it anyway. But we certainly lost our credibility both overseas and domestically, and I do not believe it has been fully regained yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened at that stage? The Government had put up the price of the levy to 20 per cent, then 30 per cent. We all remember the stupid situation where the Government made it a 30 per cent levy with a 20 per cent surcharge&mdash;the surcharge going towards the cost of the slaughter levy. We had the Government saying that the woolgrowers would not only give up 50 per cent of their wool cheque but also face a quota. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Opposition was opposing this all the way along because we had done our figures&mdash;figures that were never queried by anyone. Not even the Government queried them with any sincerity at all. We said that there was no need for any of this nonsense and that, yes, we would have a commercial slaughter price but that the levy should be maintained at 10 per cent. The Government was frightened that a 10 per cent levy might not pay it back every cent that it was determined to get, and it struck the levy at 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the Democrats, in their usual way&mdash;while they would not question our figures&mdash;would not go along with us. They went, as they usually do, for the happy medium, as they called it&mdash;a 12 per cent levy. As my colleague has already said today, every one cent difference is $1,000 to the woolgrower. The average woolgrower in Australia has only around 3,800 sheep, not 4,000 sheep, so the price of the levy was critical to him. Because this Government would not listen to reason, the woolgrowers have been faced with a levy 2 per cent higher than is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our figures were very conservative. They pointed to the need for a 9.1 per cent levy. That was on the very low 447c a kilo clean wool. There was a cushioning effect in our 10 per cent proposition of 0.9 per cent, but the Government still would not accept our position. I remember that we were still debating the wool levy Bill at 2 o'clock and 3 o'clock in the morning. We now know that the floor price is above 447c a kilo clean. We could have brought the levy down to our alternative figure if a 475c price clean had been used. On that assumption, we decided that we needed an 8.7 per cent levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has wasted money and the time of the Senate. It had additional Bills drafted and there were costs associated with that. It deprived the woolgrowers of thousands and thousands of dollars because it would not listen to reason. The Government is not alone; the Democrats supported it. Let us not take all the responsibility off the Democrats and give it to the Government. While the Government was stupid enough to say that a 15 per cent levy was the lowest it could possibly put up, the Democrats would not look at our figures with any commonsense. They said that they would make it 12 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were right: there was no need for anything above 10 per cent. Indeed, we were being very conservative: we could have had a 9 per cent levy. The Government is still being so cautious that it will not go beyond that. I suppose it is with some gratification that we can look at the balance sheet that we proposed just 12 months ago and say that it was spot on. There was never any need for a 15 per cent levy; there was never any need for a 12 per cent levy. I do not know what the Department was on about advising the Government on figures such as that. It is about time the Department learnt a lesson too. There was never a need for anything above a 10 per cent levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition supports this legislation, but the Government should understand that it has deprived the industry of any sort of income. I refer to the ABARE National Agricultural and Resources Outlook Conference 1992. ABARE says that farm business profit in the sheep industry will be minus $45,200 this year. In part, that is due not only to the drought but also to the Government's handling of this levy and this legislation. </PARA>

The gloom and doom merchants have always predicted the demise of the wool industry, and each time it has bounced back better than ever. Last Friday the wool stockpile stood at 4,070,000 bales&mdash;down 535,000 bales from its peak of 4,600,000 bales a little over 12 months ago. At the close of the season's sales at the end of next week, the debt against the stockpile will be between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion. Twelve months ago it was $2.8 billion. Expectations in the first year were for sales of 350,000 bales from the stockpile, which were exceeded and 550,000 bales were eventually removed. The Wool Realisation Commission has now enough to meet its costs for the next 12 months and still be below the debt reduction required of $2.559 billion at this time next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent weeks, as a response to higher projected wool production estimates for the remainder of this season, we have seen the indicator fall about 15c.

In 1988-89 Australia exported $869m worth of wool to the Soviet Union, representing in excess of 600,000 bales. The current crisis in the now Commonwealth of Independent States has had a major impact on the repayment of this debt.

They have every right to do so, and I believe that it is only right that they should. However, I am told that these concerns do not appear to be reflected in the property prices of the area, but I am not any expert on Sydney values these days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for an enlargement of the objectives of the organisation and the sale of goods and services. The reason it is being dealt with now is mainly the legal decision that caused the trouble with the judgment as to what those involved could or could not do about the transfer of materials in or out of the premises. That is the real purpose of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two deals that were involved were the transfer of low grade radioactive material from Fishermans Bend in Victoria and the transfer of an amount from St Marys in the Sydney area. The Bill provides for the conditioning, managing and storing of radioactive materials and it provides immunity to the organisation from various State and local government matters. That, in itself, has caused quite a bit of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has caused concern because it has been so badly handled. There was never really any need for this to become a major issue, but it did because the whole thing was rushed. It looked as though it was a means of trying to get around what had been a legal decision. The Commonwealth saw that in order to operate effectively it required the ability to override some of the decisions that would otherwise have affected it. So be it; that is the way it is. That is the source of the difference of opinion between the organisation and the Government, as the representative of the organisation&mdash;or the other way around&mdash;and the people who have these various concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Shire of Sutherland has been very active and very vocal in its concerns. Its representatives came along and gave evidence, as did many other people, to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and we listened to their evidence very keenly. They are concerned about the possibility of an accident of any sort and about a possible build-up of the material that is stored there. They particularly do not want Lucas Heights to become a national repository. The Minister came along to the Senate Committee hearing. He gave undertakings that this would not be the case under his jurisdiction and, ultimately, we were able to get the Government to amend the Bill which is before us to that effect. I give notice that we will be supporting that amendment when it comes along. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The witnesses were also concerned about the increase in activity. As I have mentioned, one of the main points in the amendments is the fact that the objectives of the organisation have been enlarged to some extent. Of course, this enlargement will give rise to added amounts of nuclear waste. This concerns them also. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already said that the Government has handled the issue badly. It is always dicey to rush things through without adequate discussion. There will always be an element which will object and wonder why things have been rushed through and covered up. This is a case of a very sensitive issue which could have been handled much better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The witnesses who appeared before us were unanimously united about the possible difficulties and particularly about the fact that they were left with the perception of an increased risk. While I notice that Senator Richardson was reported recently as having made the comment that we do not have to worry about fear, that it can be an excellent weapon&mdash;or words to that effect&mdash;it is a very bad thing when something is left in limbo and, as a result, people cannot be put at ease in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public relations of the Government, and in this case ANSTO, have been quite inadequate. I do not think the legislation is adequate to put people at ease yet, but it will certainly help in some ways. It is now up to the Government to make the required adequate provisions for the future. The date of 5 January 1995 has been laid down for the establishment of a new repository. The Government has to get this under way so that the people of the area can settle down and so that the people of Australia will be able to see that the nuclear industry still has a future and a good one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to retain and improve our nuclear industry. There are so many areas where Australia has done well in this field. Our great atomic scientists have given Australia great service and they must go on doing so and further the application of this science in industry, agriculture and health. As a result of the Senate Committee inquiry there is not only an assurance but also now the amendment, as I have mentioned, that there will now not be a nuclear repository at Lucas Heights. It is up to the Government to get on with finalising the arrangements. The Opposition will support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Bill. The Senate is debating a Bill that has been a source of much controversy in my home State of New South Wales, particularly in the Sutherland Shire which is where the Lucas Heights reactor is located. It is well known that the residents of the Sutherland Shire Council area and the Council itself are implacably opposed to this Bill. So is the New South Wales Government and Labor, Democrat and Independent members of State Parliament. Environment groups, such as the Sutherland Shire Environment Centre and Greenpeace, have also voiced their strong opposition. Moreover, the general public is extremely concerned about the ramifications of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This led the Senate to agree to refer the Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. The Committee held a public hearing on 25 May to listen to these concerns. A number of local groups, along with the New South Wales State Government, were able to put their problems on the table. This was an extremely valuable exercise in helping to clarify the issues at stake and allowing members of the community to have their say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As outlined in my minority report, the Australian Democrats agree substantially with the conclusions reached by the Committee. The Committee found that there is real concern that ANSTO will be empowered to transport nuclear waste not produced as a result of ANSTO's activities at Lucas Heights to Lucas Heights for indefinite storage, establishing a de facto nuclear waste dump and removing the urgency of identifying and establishing a permanent, safe nuclear waste repository. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee considered that the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) could do much to allay community concerns by giving legislative effect to his assurances concerning Lucas Heights not being used as a national permanent nuclear waste repository. We are pleased to see that the Government has distributed an amendment which goes some way to giving this assurance, but not far enough. I will be moving an amendment which strengthens the weak assurance given by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill adds to ANSTO's functions by stating that it will condition, manage and store radioactive materials and radioactive waste. This section has caused alarm and  justifiable concern which should be addressed by this chamber. The Committee also considered that the Minister could further allay concerns by giving legislative effect to his assurances concerning the effects of commercialisation of ANSTO and the Government's commitment to the establishment of a permanent nuclear waste repository by 1995. The Minister has patently failed to do so. In fact, the Government has done nothing to allay genuine fears in the community that this Bill will cause a serious erosion of people's rights and possibly lead to the importation of nuclear waste into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill, if passed in its present form, will exempt ANSTO from State environmental and planning legislation. ANSTO will be subject only to Commonwealth law; however, the Commonwealth has no parallel environmental and planning laws. This is totally unjustifiable. The Bill effectively puts ANSTO above State and Territory environment laws. The Commonwealth is riding roughshod over the local Sutherland Shire community and the rights of all citizens, not only in New South Wales but in all States and Territories of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister in his second reading speech claimed that ANSTO was established under Commonwealth legislation to undertake specified activities in the national interest in accordance with the policies of the Commonwealth Government, and that the Government had never intended that ANSTO be subject to State laws. Here is a conflict between the national interest and local and State interests. The Government has not sought in any way to accommodate local and State interests. It has simply adopted commando control tactics which completely disregard the rights and concerns of ordinary citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the view of the Democrats that this part of the Bill is a total abrogation of the intergovernmental agreement on the environment, a memorandum of understanding which seeks greater cooperation amongst the States on environmental issues. The Commonwealth must have broad agreement amongst the States if we are to fight some of the major environmental issues facing this country, such as land degradation, coastal management and waste disposal. Indeed, agreement of the States will be necessary if the whole issue of a national nuclear waste repository is to be resolved. One would hope that somewhat more consultation will take place on that question than has been the case on the ANSTO Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the words of my minority report, this Bill will erode confidence in the process of cooperation with the States on environmental matters. However, the Minister has deemed cooperation and consultation with the States as unnecessary. He has cited the so-called national interest. Certainly, during the public hearing it became evident that ANSTO did in fact need certain powers to deal with particular issues of waste storage and waste management. The case of isotope packages broken at Mascot airport was raised as an example, and we would agree that provision should be made for waste management of this nature at Lucas Heights. However, it is unnecessary to give ANSTO the wide powers contained in this Bill to deal with those occurrences. To that extent, and when the proposed management activities are combined with ANSTO's commercial activities and the potential for expansion, community concern about this legislation is fully justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But our objections do not stop here. The Government proposes to make the immunity in proposed new section 7A retrospective so that ANSTO will be taken to have never been subject to State and Territory laws. This smacks of a government hastily cobbling together a piece of legislation to overcome the difficulties posed by the New South Wales Land and Environment Court decision. The Government makes a concession to the order by Justice Cribbs that ANSTO must remove the 2,000 cubic metres of radioactively contaminated soil from Fishermans Bend in Victoria. This is a concession, however, that we had to have. It would have been completely untenable for the Government to have breached this order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another unacceptable aspect to this Bill is that the immunity provisions are extended to those organisations in which ANSTO has a controlling interest. Private companies in which ANSTO has or has had a controlling interest should not be allowed privileges of immunity to State laws. All private companies should be subject to State laws regardless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions of this Bill would potentially make ANSTO one of the only commercial organisations in Australia exempt from any State planning and environment laws. I will be moving an amendment to that whole clause relating to immunity so that it may be omitted from the Bill and replaced with an assurance that ANSTO is subject to Commonwealth law and to State and Territory law. This should ensure that maximum safeguards are in place on the activities of ANSTO. It makes sense to apply State laws as an extra safeguard and that more than one level of government have control over safety standards set in a nuclear facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern expressed by those at the public hearing was that this Bill could lead to the importation by ANSTO of radioactive waste. I will refer back to these two issues later on. The Minister did, however, to his credit give assurances that Australia will not engage in the importation of radioactive waste. He was quite explicit about this in his evidence to the Committee. However, I would ask the Senate whether we can simply rely on his assurances. His and our presence in this chamber is but a flash in the pan in the context of the longevity of radioactive waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Committee report recommended, the Minister's assurances should be enshrined within the Bill before us. This will bind ANSTO to the spirit of the assurances given by the Minister. Accordingly, I will be moving an amendment to the Bill to ensure that ANSTO must not import radioactive waste. I have also included an assurance that this does not include the import or export of pharmaceutical isotopes&mdash;radioisotopes. This is a valid activity for ANSTO to be engaged in, and I have no wish to restrict its activities in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To sum up, this is the Democrats' view: this legislation does nothing to enhance the public image of ANSTO, an organisation which has sought greater transparency of its activities over the last few years. The Bill has engendered a great deal of suspicion about the activities of ANSTO. I would agree with my Committee colleague Senator Archer in that this Bill in fact does nothing to allay those fears and will simply result in increased suspicion about what happens at Lucas Heights. It is vitally important that Lucas Heights be subject to the utmost public transparency so that any fears, whether they are justified or unjustified, can be dealt with and handled in a responsible and open fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that there is considerable concern within the Labor Party about these proposals. The Government is certainly not united on this Bill. It is our view that the acceptance of the Democrats' amendments would go a long way to restoring the broken trust between ANSTO and the Sutherland Shire community, and I commend the amendments to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Bill 1992 for various reasons, which I will point out a little later. The purpose of this Bill is, firstly, to amend the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act of 1987 to implement the Government's decision to include in the functions of ANSTO the conditioning, storage and management of radioactive materials and waste, and implement revisions which better reflect the Commonwealth's objective to commercialise ANSTO's activities; and, secondly, to provide for ANSTO's immunity from specified classes of State and Territory laws and regulations following advice that, although not intended by the Government, ANSTO may be fully subject to State and Territory laws. It is that aspect that worries me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that I can tell a good story of the situation in Western Australia. This Bill's coming in front of the Parliament this evening prompted a big article in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>&mdash;unfortunately, I do not have it with me tonight&mdash;again raising fears that we will have a national waste disposal system at Mount Walton in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in about 1985 when I was President of the Shire of Yilgarn in Western Australia, the State Government, led by none other than Mr Burke, tried to put a high temperature incinerator into Koolyanobbing, which is a small iron ore town right on the edge of the wheat belt, in which the mine had closed down. Unbeknown to anyone, the State Government had tried to slip one in there. The earliest we heard&mdash;it did not have the courtesy to let the local shire know; it could not do anything like that&mdash;was when one of the contractors who was working around the place saw some people filming a disused quarry. He pulled up and asked them what they were up to. I think it was Channel 7 from Perth that told him that this was the site of the new high temperature incinerator, so it was filming the site. That was the first indication we got. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we made inquiries we found that the project was well down the track. The Government had a plan and a costing for it. It had a firm picked out, because it was going to be a commercial enterprise. It had that all picked out and was ready to build a high temperature incinerator there, I believe to get rid of about 1,000 tonnes of PCBs in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is when the shire went into action and we were able to stop it moving into there. In exchange, we gave it a site at Mount Walton, some 70 kilometres north-east of Koolyanobbing in the pastoral and mining area, to create a storage dump to store the 1,000-odd tonnes of PCBs in Western Australia until a high temperature incinerator could be built, hopefully on a national scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Shire of Yilgarn agreed with the State Government that we would have no objection to that under the right sorts of safety factors. Of course, we did agree at the time, subsequent to when I was in that Council, to let it store low level radioactive material in that place. I understand it has progressed so far down the track now that there is drilling to test the ground to ascertain whether it is suitable to bury the waste at a certain depth without getting into the water table or something like that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having got that far, according to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> this morning, Mr Crean, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, has set up an inquiry to look at three sites in Australia for a national disposal centre. He is looking at Mount Walton in Western Australia, Maralinga in South Australia and an as yet unnamed site in Queensland. I urge the people of Queensland to find out where that site is. They are the three sites that are being looked at, obviously for a national storage location. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am on record as saying that we need a national incinerator or a national storage spot for these materials that require storage and that the materials that can be destroyed should be destroyed. When a site is found it has to be remote but reasonably accessible to transport&mdash;preferably rail. It has to be ensured that it is not in a viable mining area or a viable pastoral area. I have fears for Mount Walton, because an arrangement was made that our shire would store material at Mount Walton from the State of Western Australia and material was not to be brought there from other than Western Australia, particularly from overseas. That is my worry. That is the arrangement we came to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sympathetic to what Senator Sowada had to say about Lucas Heights because it is near a residential area. I believe that this Parliament and, indeed, all Australia should support a proper national disposal centre or incinerator centre in a remote area. I am on the public record as saying that that area could be Maralinga, which is pretty near central Australia. It is in reasonable proximity to the standard gauge railway. One only has to go north of the trans-Australia line by road and west of the Ghan line that runs from Port Augusta up to Alice Springs. Unfortunately, the ground in that area is already desecrated as a result of other activities that were carried on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we should support a site at a central location, but certainly it should not take anything from beyond Australia. I spoke out on the public record in Western Australia about a contract that the State Government entered into for some of this PCB waste to be destroyed in Wales. I am a great believer that we should not take someone else's waste, nor do I believe that we should foist our waste onto any other country in the world, especially one with a high population such as Wales or the rest of Europe. So I believe that export is certainly out and I believe that we should not take anyone else's waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, I go along with the thrust of this legislation, even though I am sympathetic to Senator Sowada's point of view. But it does worry me that we are giving the Commonwealth Government, including any subcontractors or private enterprise organisations it may employ, the right to transcend State laws. That certainly does worry me. Even by giving the Federal Government the right in this legislation to do this, no matter what State we might be looking at in which to build a national incinerator or national storage location, I believe the wishes of the State and the local governments close to the sites should be considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have told you, Mr Deputy President, I had the experience of being the President of the shire in Western Australia where it was attempted to locate an incinerator. I would bet London to a brick that if Mr Burke's Government had been able to build Koolyanobbing at the time, there would be a national incinerator there now. So, yes, we are going to support this legislation and the Federal Government will get these powers, but I certainly hope that it does not override the States; otherwise we will have a debate at some other time. </PARA>

To that extent, we ask very strongly that the Government does engage in the kind of consultation that needs to happen on this issue and does not simply ride roughshod over the States, as it has done with the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Bill.

There is certainly no intention to set up a nuclear waste repository in everybody's backyard, but that could well be alleged by the Liberals during Question Time tomorrow, so I thought I had better get on my feet and announce that it is not government policy.

There is no government policy to establish a nuclear waste repository anywhere else.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>This amendment is to omit the most offending clause in this legislation relating to the immunity of ANSTO from State planning and environment laws. I simply reiterate what I said during the second reading debate: it is totally inappropriate for a commercial and research organisation such as ANSTO to be exempt from the most rigorous State planning and environment laws, which do not exist at a Commonwealth level. The Australian Democrats believe that nothing related to ANSTO's activities has any national interest criteria applying to it, as the Minister suggested in his second reading speech in the other place.

From our point of view, there is no need for it to be exempt from those laws, especially when the Commonwealth does not have the same kind of powers and laws in place to ensure that the most rigorous environmental standards apply to what is potentially a very dangerous scientific activity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Amendment Bill amends the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989, which established the national industrial chemical notification and assessment scheme. The 1989 Act established a national system of notification assessment of industrial chemicals to protect people at work, the public and the environment from the harmful effects of industrial chemicals. The Bill is a progression from the 1989 Act, which was intended to remove an impediment to product development. It provides for the exclusion of chemicals which are being commercially evaluated from the elaborate and expensive assessment provisions of the Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment is self-evidently beneficial. It is supported by the Opposition and the industry. The Bill introduces a new division 1A, which establishes a commercial evaluation permit system for new industrial chemicals and will allow for them to be manufactured or imported to determine their potential for commercial application. What usually happens now is that when a new industrial chemical is imported into or manufactured in Australia it must be subject to a full assessment under the national industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme, or NICNAS for short. The NICNAS regulations were a problem to industry as they restricted the introduction of new chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main objective of the proposed commercial evaluation permit system is to bypass the assessment certificate system while ensuring that adequate safeguards are met where the introduction of new industrial chemicals is needed for the sole purpose of commercial evaluation. The new system will ensure that the maximum quantity of chemical that may be introduced is 2,000 kilograms for a maximum period of two years. There are a few qualifications to this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking back to when the industrial chemicals Bill was debated in this place in December 1989, I notice that my former colleague Senator Puplick raised a concern that the Act would lead to undue delays and costs to the industry applicants for assessment. This is, of course, what happened and is the reason for the amendment we are currently debating. The Bill has been sought by industry, and the coalition supports this reduction of regulatory burden on industry while maintaining necessary safeguards. It is a forerunner to a number of changes to improve the scheme, and I understand that the industry is enthusiastic about further amendments expected later this year. As indicated earlier, the Opposition supports the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Amendment Bill 1992 seeks to amend the principal Act by implementing a new commercial evaluation permit system, where a company seeks to either import or manufacture a limited quantity of a new industrial chemical for commercial evaluation purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats will be supporting this Bill, with one minor amendment which I will move at the committee stage. It is our view that this Bill will provide industry with a regulatory mechanism for new chemicals which will result in a far easier assessment process for products before they reach the commercial application stage. This move will particularly benefit the paint industry and those companies which require chemicals in large amounts for commercial testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Companies will be able to manufacture or import a maximum of 2,000 kilograms for a maximum of two years. Strict requirements will be placed upon an applicant who wishes to introduce a chemical in excess of 1,000 kilograms, or introduce it for more than one year, and an applicant will have to prove that the excess time and quantity are absolutely necessary for commercial evaluation purposes. The Director of the national industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme also retains strong powers to revoke a permit if the applicant has breached the terms and conditions under which it was issued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commercial evaluation permit procedures are, in our view, satisfactory. Industry will be required to prepare a material safety data sheet outlining health impacts, safety procedures and physical properties of the chemical, amongst other things. Further information may also be required by the Director of Chemicals Notification and Assessment, under clause 21F. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats were initially concerned that the material safety data sheet did not include a statement of the environmental effects in respect of commercial evaluation permits. However, the Department of Industrial Relations has advised us that at various meetings with the chemical industry and the ACTU it was agreed that material specified as `other information' in the regulatory device under clause 21D(2)(b) would include material from the schedules to the Act that requires information on the environmental effects of the chemical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also agreed that paragraphs 7 and 8 of part B of the schedule to the Act, which deals with environmental matters, would be information that would be prescribed under the proposed paragraph 21D(2)(b). This agreement has been endorsed by the national industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme tripartite advisory committee. I hope the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Cook) will endorse this advice in the chamber. This Bill will not abrogate the national industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme, as a chemical will still be subject to full assessment should an applicant desire to use the new chemical for commercial purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will enable industry to effectively and quickly evaluate new chemicals without the red tape necessary for full commercial use. The commercial evaluation permit system, as outlined in this Bill, will help industry to respond to the current atmosphere of swift change, and produce development in manufacturing without compromising environmental standards. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply want to refer briefly to a matter I raised during Question Time today and to which I received an unsatisfactory answer. I remind the Senate that I asked Senator Button representing the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about the declarations of interest of the Prime Minister, particularly relating to the Danpork joint venture. I referred the Minister to the Prime Minister's declaration to the Clerk of the House of Representatives that on 15 May last year, while Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Keating invested in `a company which has interests in a piggery and a refrigeration fabrication business' but that this did not constitute a controlling interest and that he was not a director.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button has continually claimed that `the Prime Minister's family company has invested in a joint venture company which is composed of Danpork and Brown and Hatton; the Prime Minister's returns and declarations of interest have been published in relation to that matter; and he has been absolutely diligent in declaring his interests'. I asked Senator Button:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where in this allegedly full declaration by the Prime Minister is there any mention of Brown and Hatton, or Danpork, or any statement or even indication that he&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Mr Keating&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has in reality a half interest in the pig investment company involved in this multi-million dollar, multinational, payroll tax exempted joint venture in pigs; that his nominee is on the board; and that the joint venture stands to gain considerably from decisions by his Government, such as FIRB approvals or exemptions?</PARA>
<PARA>Naturally, I did not get a coherent answer to that question. So I repeated it in a supplementary question. I also asked whether or not Senator Button agreed with the proposition that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . where a conflict of interest with a member's public duty could foreseeably arise or be seen to arise, should be stated?</PARA>
<PARA>That comes from the House of Representatives declaration of interest requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button's response was simply to abuse me personally. I do not mind; it does not bother me. I have been abused by experts, let alone amateurs such as Senator Button. As a result of his failure to answer that question, I believe there are some significant problems that now clearly arise. At the end of his response to me, Senator Button said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in terms of the Prime Minister's investment in his family company, the Prime Minister has done everything he is required to do by rules which this Government introduced and which those opposite do not support in the Senate at any time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That was a very significant change of ground by Senator Button. Having first of all said that these matters were effectively fully detailed and that the Prime Minister's family company has invested in a joint venture company, et cetera, all those quotes from Senator Button have now magically disappeared and, instead, Senator Button is saying that the Prime Minister, in terms of investment in his family company, has done everything he is required to do. Apart from anything else, that demonstrates that the rules are absurd. His statement in relation to his family company hides the reality that he has a half interest in this matter; that he had a clear benefit to be obtained from Government decisions in relation to Danpork; and that the Prime Minister had by a device failed to indicate that he had the interest which has now been so clearly publicised as a result of my efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What interests me particularly about this is that it is a breach of the spirit of the requirements of the House of Representatives. That leads to the inevitable question: how meaningful, how useful, are such declarations of interest if they can be so readily got around by someone with a mind to do it&mdash;such as the Prime Minister, who sought to hide the reality and the significance of his investments? With the normal and the old system, if one had a conflict or a potential for conflict, one was expected to get up in this place and reveal that conflict. That is what one was supposed to do. If one failed to reveal it, one had behaved dishonourably. Maybe there should be penalties for not so doing. But the present system clearly does not work. The present system does not reveal the potential for conflict of interest and the actual conflict of interest that took place in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of the Senate to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cabinet Handbook</EMPHASIS> which says that Ministers should adopt a broad interpretation of the requirement, that they should take into account the interests of family members and all interests of their own when considering whether there is a conflict or a potential or apparent conflict which should be declared. If the Prime Minister is not covered by that, what on earth is he covered by? We have a situation where there is a clear conflict of interest. Government decisions have been made to the benefit of the Prime Minister. There has been a phoney facade of Government requirements to declare interest generated, behind which the Prime Minister hides because of a technicality. His henchman here, Senator Button, having first got up and said, `He has revealed all', then resiled from that dramatically in the last response to me today. He said, `In respect of his family company, he has technically met the requirements'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find this to be an absolute disgrace, and probably one of the best arguments to support the Opposition's proposition that these declarations of interest are a farce in the hands of someone who seeks to get around them, someone like the Prime Minister. Going back to the old system, we find that if a person had a conflict or a potential conflict of interest, that person would declare that conflict or potential conflict of interest. That is the proper way to conduct oneself. I hope that in subsequent discussions in this place on such a matter the Government will take into serious account the failure of its own legislation, its own rules, to require the Prime Minister to behave with propriety. He has not behaved properly; he has used a device to avoid revealing to the public the nature and extent of his interest in this multinational joint venture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I look forward to hearing the usual round-up speech by Senator Ray about members of the present Opposition or previous members of a coalition government having failed to reveal some interest in something, all I can say is this: those in the Government are claiming some special integrity and have legislated for it; they are claiming to have introduced rules that prevent people from sneaking around them, like the Prime Minister has. Their Leader has shown them how meaningless&mdash;as we have been arguing&mdash;such nonsensical legislation is when we have someone like the Prime Minister who is determined to get around it, determined to conceal the significance of a holding in a company involved in a major joint venture, and receiving a benefit from the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been asked by various people: `Why on earth do you think Mr Keating did this? Why did he go into this pig venture in a major way? After all, he has invested $430,000 out of his family company's total assets of $480,000 in this one venture. Why do it?'. When I look at the dates of all of this, I suppose I get a fair indication of what may have been the answer. Shortly after he ceased being the Treasurer, after he had unsuccessfully challenged Mr Hawke for the prime ministership, Mr Keating wrote a letter on 7 June 1991 to Mr Lyn Barlin, the Registrar of Members Interests. The letter advised that the investment took place&mdash;this was just a little investment and the Prime Minister was not a director, although he had a nominee on the board, and so on&mdash;</PARA>

We are being sufficiently tender for me not to draw any conclusions from this.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clear indication is that, had Mr Keating decided that he wanted to withdraw from politics, this piggery would have provided him with an interesting business interest outside parliament. It is very difficult to find another reason why someone who is now Prime Minister would put himself in a position of potential conflict of interest, which the facts indicate he has put himself in. One would have thought that, having entered into this business arrangement, becoming Prime Minister would have encouraged him not to continue with it in view of the specific requirements of his ministerial standing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I expect that the Government response will be, `Oh, well, you lot did all sorts of funny things'.

This particular set of alleged protections does not protect the public from hidden holdings where there is a potential for conflict of interest. That is a simple and undeniable fact.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have&mdash;and this is the issue&mdash;is a situation now where the public are deceived into believing they are protected on matters of conflict of interest yet people who have such conflicts do not reveal them by simply meeting the requirements. In relation to Mr Keating's declaration, Senator Button said, `He has done everything he is required to do by the rules'&mdash;and yet the rules do not require him to declare a conflict of interest.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I deal finally with section 2.17 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cabinet Handbook </EMPHASIS>in which it is said, `Directorships in private companies must also be resigned'&mdash;that is if one becomes a Minister&mdash;`unless, for example, such companies operate a family farm, business or investments, and the retention of a directorship is not likely to conflict with the public duty of the Minister'. If one has a nominee as a director, one clearly gets around that requirement. Is that really what should be done? Should we have those sorts of rules?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It further states, `Ministers are to derive no income through personal exertion other than as Ministers or members of the Parliament'&mdash;I do not suppose having conversations with the chairman of the company one has a joint venture with could be described as `personal exertion', although some might think it is&mdash;`and to divest themselves of shares or similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities; and, should any particular conflict between duty and interest arise during the course of their administration of their departments, to inform the Prime Minister so that he can decide how the particular matter should be handled'. That probably is the last, if you like, bad joke in this absolutely ludicrous set of guidelines. Yet this Government, having seen the way these guidelines can be got around, is now talking about trying to introduce something like that into this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is just ludicrous when clear conflicts of interest can escape, unless of course those on the opposite side are now going to get up and tell me, `We're going to close that loophole so people like the Prime Minister can't get around it'. If they are going to do that, I commend them for their energy but not their intelligence because it is not the way to fix the problem. But I fear they have no way to fix the problem; they have no intention of fixing the problem; and schemes like the one the Prime Minister has employed will be available to others of like mind. </PARA>

I can just imagine John Kerin and later Ralph Willis saying, having had Paul Keating ring them up, `Fine, Paul, we'll help you out'. After all, we did have a rather major conflict last year over the leadership. Everyone knows where John Kerin and Ralph Willis stood on it. Senator Baume has made an absolutely ridiculous imputation.

He owned substantial rural interests, including a major wool production area. During those eight years in the House of Representatives, when did Senator Baume stand up and say, `Prime Minister, have you stepped aside for every discussion on rural adjustment schemes, the setting of the floor price for wool?', or any of these other things?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going through the history, the richest Prime Minister in this country continued to trade shares from 1951 to 1971. Was he ever accused of a conflict of interest? I say for the record that I do not believe he was ever involved in buying or selling a share based on his knowledge of what was happening in government. He used to drive the stockbrokers of this country mad with late night phone calls about his share trading. But it was never based on inside information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume, of course, would be the silent man. In fact, it really would be good tonight if he were like that clown that never spoke, because that is what he was like between 1975 and 1983. He said nothing. I will tell honourable senators something else: if the Liberals ever win government and six or eight of these frontbenchers, with their very vast investments, become Ministers, Senator Baume will say nothing again. He will remain absolutely silent. Why? Because he is doing this as a partisan Liberal; he is trying to ingratiate himself with John Hewson who does not have the guts to take on these issues in the House of Representatives, and never will. That is what he is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know the history of Senator Baume on the front bench. He picked the wrong horse. He is not like Senator Bishop; he did not jump stream. I give him credit for that. When the going got tough and the Opposition jumped to Peacock, he got dumped. He got barrelled out as a pro-Howard supporter. Good luck to him. It happens to us all sooner or later, one time or another. The French have a great saying, `Wine drinker one day, grape picker the next'. It can happen to any of us. So what Senator Baume wants to do, to hang onto his preselection in New South Wales, is ingratiate himself with Dr Hewson as a great muck thrower. </PARA>

They are now published for Ministers, for staff and for Opposition office holders and their staff. No travel costs for overseas travel were ever published under the Opposition. They have been published under us. There was no requirement for any declaration of pecuniary interest under the Opposition's government.

He has done no more and no less than anyone&mdash;other than maybe Mr Beale who gives a lot more detail than anyone else. But all the rest of them give the same detail. Senator Baume is not up asking what public companies Jaffrey Industries Ltd has investments in; of course he is not. He would not be sitting there on the front bench if he did.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My interest in ornithology goes back many years. I do not need to tell honourable senators that Australia has an enormous variety of unique and spectacular birds. These range from the commonly seen and the very well known birds, from our magpies and currawongs to galahs and white cockatoos, to some of the very rarely sighted birds such as our ground parrot, emu wren and many of our spectacular larger parrots that are very rarely seen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early 1980s I was one of several thousand Australians who took part in a project to map where and how often all species of birds were seen across Australia and also in coastal waters. Also mapped were nest or breeding sites. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Atlas of Australian Birds</EMPHASIS> was published in 1984 by the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union. From this we can see&mdash;and I have a number of examples here tonight&mdash;that a number of our bird species are reaching endangered levels. Their range has been considerably reduced and, where their range has not been reduced, the specific populations in particular areas have certainly gone down markedly. Some species have indeed prospered. I include amongst these the long-billed corellas that now roam in very large flocks and also in some areas the galahs. Some introduced species have also flourished, and these include the sparrow and the common starling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, many of our unique and colourful parrots and finches have rapidly declined in numbers and we must ask why. Environmental degradation and loss of habitat is certainly one part of it. This involves the clearing of land; the loss of tree cover&mdash;in particular, the loss of trees with nesting sites in them&mdash;the loss of wetlands and encroaching suburbia; and all the noise and pollution that goes along with that. Predation and competition from introduced species&mdash;in particular, cats&mdash;is also a major problem. Starlings will displace our less aggressive native birds from feeding grounds and also, unfortunately, from nest sites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What seems a major problem and one that really has not been tackled seriously in any sort of collective way is the trapping and then the exporting&mdash;although many do not make it that far&mdash;of our endangered birds. In particular, I emphasise the larger parrots. These attract enormous sums of money on foreign markets and they are an enormous attraction for those who are looking for a few dollars or, indeed, a few thousand dollars, or maybe a few hundred thousand dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an area where rumours abound and from time to time a few people are indeed caught. As recent transcripts will show, in the last two years a considerable number of people have been apprehended. Some of the less common species but the regularly trapped species include the pink cockatoo or the Major Mitchell cockatoo. I will go through a series of parrots, such as the orange-breasted parrot, and refer to the specific notes on those parrots. Again, trapping for commercial purposes and destruction of habitat are two of the problems suffered by the orange-breasted parrot. The turquoise parrot is suffering as a result of the destruction of its habitat and from the menace of trapping for the caged bird market. In relation to the beautiful parakeet, rats have constituted some menace to this ground loving parakeet, but without doubt the main cause of its near extinction has been excessive hunting and trapping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bits and pieces of evidence are now coming together as to what exactly is happening to these endangered species. At this point I seek to table three documents, two transcripts of evidence and a file note. </PARA>

Senator Ray was much too mild-mannered to raise these sorts of matters, which might have been raised in the debate. He did not say that perhaps a shadow Treasurer, advocating alternative financial policies for the nation, should not be working as a consultant to Baring Securities.

I do not accuse him of conflict of interest because he and the other person who disclosed that he has investments on the stock market&mdash;the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson)&mdash;indicate that they want to reduce taxes on business by $20 billion and transfer them to the consumers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable Senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The latest estimate by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) of the total area of cereal crops planted in Australia in 1990-91 is 13,356 thousand hectares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is worth noting that because of the dry conditions which persisted through Queensland and northern New South Wales during winter last season, some of this area which was planted to grain was eventually abandoned or was grazed or cut for hay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) There are a range of methods for disposing of cereal straw currently practised by Australian growers including grazing, natural decay, partial incorporation by offset tandem discs and one-way disc ploughs, burning, rolling, slashing, flail mowing and mulching, and breaking down stubble by other mechanical means. Many of these methods involve costs associated with the destruction of the straw in preparation for planting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the variation of the types of methods used to dispose of cereal straw, depending upon such factors as the growers' cropping programs and rotations, tillage and sowing methods and soil types, an accurate indication of the proportional distribution of cereal straw destruction methods is not available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Commonwealth matches the research expenditure of the Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC), up to a limit of 0.5 percent of the gross value of production of grains in any year. In 1990-91, industry contributions through levies amounted to $12.6 million, while the Commonwealth matching contribution for expenditure in that year was $8.9 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised by the GRDC that much of the research effort it has funded in the past has involved straw disposal as an integral or incidental part of projects with other agronomic purposes, for example, stubble retention and minimum tillage systems. The GRDC has also informed me that it would not be a practicable proposition to seek to identify the amount of money attached to the straw disposal aspects of such projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The achievement of agricultural practices which are both environmentally and economically sustainable does not necessarily incorporate a goal of returning organic matter to the soil in every case. This would depend upon, for example, factors such as cereal and grass borne disease control, soil structures, intended land use, or the environmental effects of alternative disposal practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end the farm management practices and the operation of the farm as a business will together determine the method of cereal straw disposal which, for the long term success of the farming enterprise, should seek to achieve a balance between environmentally and economically sustainable cropping enterprises.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 4 May 1992 (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> page 2034) Senator Reid asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice concerning:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"In view of the fact that the annual inflation rate was 1.7 per cent for the year to the end of the March quarter 1992, that the average weekly earnings increased by only 2 per cent in the year to the end of the December quarter 1991, and that interest rates on savings investment accounts have almost halved, will the Government introduce legislation to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act to calculate the increase in provisional taxpayers' income at a more just and realistic level than the current 10 per cent?"</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Treasurer</EMPHASIS> has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisional tax uplift factor was set at the rate of 10 per cent to reflect broadly the expected long term growth in incomes subject to provisional tax. While inflation and interest rates are components of the growth in incomes subject to provisional tax, they are not the only components. Incomes subject to provisional tax may be expected to exhibit quite a sharp proportional rise during the emergence from an economic downturn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a taxpayer considers that the amount of provisional tax assessed in any year is more than his or her expected tax liability for the year, the taxpayer is able to vary the provisional tax liability to the amount of the expected lesser tax liability. This self-assessment option is available to those who believe their incomes for the year will not rise by 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 10 per cent uplift factor was set in legislation with a view to making the provisional tax system more simple and certain by avoiding the need to adjust the rate annually. Nevertheless, the Government is monitoring the experience with the current uplift factor, and would introduce amending legislation, if it believed that alteration of the uplift factor was warranted in future years.</PARA>
