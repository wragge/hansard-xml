That was in the last Budget statement and that was one of the unfortunate things that we had to face up to.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GG4">Senator FOREMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Transport and Communications aware that Optus launched the first phase of its mobile telephone network yesterday? What benefits will flow to customers from this service? Is the launch of this system an indication that the Government's micro-economic reform program in telecommunications is producing positive results?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3636" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, Optus Communications, the second telecommunications carrier, began operating mobile services in New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory, only four months after it was licensed to do so. I understand it received around 1,500 calls inquiring about the service on that day. Mobile services in Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania are to commence on 15 July and the remaining mobile services are to commence on 15 August.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Initially, Optus mobile services will operate on AOTC's analogue cellular system. However, by the second quarter of 1993, it will begin services on its own GSM mobile network. GSM is a digital rather than an analogue cellular mobile telephony standard, which is state-of-the-art technology. This is the first major tangible benefit of the Government's telecommunications reforms. It provides the consumer with a choice of operator and, as Optus rolls out its own network, it will offer better quality and a wider range of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, the introduction of competition is having an effect on price from the very beginning. For example, a saving of 31 per cent&mdash;that is, 20c as compared to 29c&mdash;can be made on a 30-second local call under the Optus economy plan compared with the Telecom flexiplan standard. Optus believes that the majority of mobile phone users will save up to 10 per cent on current costs under the three pricing plans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the longer term, Optus believes that prices for domestic and international long distance and business network services will drop by 40 per cent in real terms over the first five years of operation and 60 per cent over 10 years. More choice will be available around Christmas this year when Optus proposes to begin offering long distance services from Sydney, Melbourne and here in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the next five years, Optus plans to spend some $2 billion on designing and building fixed and mobile services. Optus began laying its nationwide optical fibre in March this year. By 1997, it expects that more than 90 per cent of its traffic will be carried on its own network. This large capital expenditure program will flow through to other sectors of the telecommunications network.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Minister representing the Prime Minister and follows the question asked previously of him by Senator Hill. When the Prime Minister, when he was Treasurer, boasted that he had engineered the recession we had to have, did he take into account the fact that it would lead to record postwar unemployment figures of 10.6 per cent nationally and the absolute disaster of 34 per cent youth unemployment? What policy action, if any, will the Government be taking to address this horrific human tragedy? In particular, will the Government make the necessary financial arrangements with the States to abolish that iniquitous tax on jobs, namely, payroll tax? Will the Government reduce the Budget deficit and hence its borrowing drain on the private sector? Will the Government now scrap its ill-conceived plans for introducing another tax on employment in the form of the superannuation guarantee levy?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3636" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first part of the question, as usual, is couched in terms which are smart rather than intelligent. Senator Short full well knows that, when the Prime Minister made that remark about the recession, he was talking about reducing the level of growth in the Australian economy, which was unsustainable. He has made comments about what he said since, which the honourable senator is fully aware of. In so far as whether at the time that statement was made there was any intention or understanding in his mind that these levels of unemployment would arise from it, the answer of course is no.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, that is something you would understand. In relation to what Senator Short has described as the ameliorative policies which could be followed, the most ameliorating policy is to return growth to the Australian economy. That is what this Government has been trying to do. We have had 1.5 per cent growth for the last three quarters. The honourable senator and I have had exchanges in the Senate about whether that is likely to improve and what the effects will be in relation to the projections made in the One Nation statement. That is the prime task which the Government has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As distinct from other countries which have similar high levels of unemployment, we do have a fairly reasonably cohesive social security system and safety net here. In so far as the magic wands of payroll tax and so on are concerned, payroll tax has been around in this country for a very long time. I have to proffer the view that if we were to abolish payroll tax tomorrow as, by implication, the honourable senator suggests could be done&mdash;and it could not be done tomorrow, particularly under the Opposition's package because it would have to finance it and it would take several years; nor could it be done in terms of the honourable senator's own question about the size of the Budget deficit&mdash;I do not think that would provide a solution to the problem which we are all apparently concerned about. I am. In so far as reducing the Budget deficit is concerned, that is totally inconsistent with the honourable senator's suggestion that we abolish payroll tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the third issue, of superannuation, I will say nothing at the present time because it is still under discussion. When those discussions have been resolved the honourable senator can comment about the results.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade advise whether Australian import restrictions on US products are set at the same standards as United States import restrictions on Australian products? Further, is there evidence that the Australian export industry has been disadvantaged by inequitable import restrictions?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3637" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The impediments to United States trade with Australia simply cannot be compared with the kinds of restrictions Australia continues to face in the United States market and the impact that United States policies have on third country markets of interest to Australia. That is so, notwithstanding the fact that the US is Australia's second largest trading partner in a relationship that works very much to the advantage of the United States, with a balance of trade approximately 2 : 1 in favour of the US.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To protect its domestically sensitive industries, the US continues to maintain very significant import restrictions, through not only tariffs but also non-tariff measures. The impact of non-tariff measures on manufacturers is not great, although there are exceptions, such as the provisions of the Jones Act which effectively restrict the transportation of merchandise by water between points in the United States to vessels not only owned and registered in the US, but also built there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as access to the US market for other export commodities&mdash;beef, sugar and dairy products other than manufactures&mdash;is concerned, the situation is really very serious with the restrictions of import quotas that apply in that area. Australia has access to only around 4 per cent of total US beef consumption and one per cent of the US sugar market and negligible access to the US dairy market. Compounding the situation, particularly for our rural industries, is the aggressive use of export subsidies by the United States, largely for wheat, but also for rice, barley, malt and dairy products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia also faces significant barriers in the US market in relation to services&mdash;an area which is sometimes underappreciated and neglected in analysis and commentary&mdash;such as telecommunications, banking and insurance, where a whole range of regulations, including at the State level, discriminate against foreign firms generally operating in the US market. In relation to government procurement, the United States has in place `buy America' legislation which currently effectively minimises foreign access to approximately one per cent of that market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the United States is very well aware of our concerns, which we have pursued relentlessly over the years. Clearly, some of those concerns over access to the US market and the impact that some US policies have indirectly on Australia in third markets will be ameliorated with a positive outcome to the Uruguay Round. Both of our countries remain wholly committed to that. We can only hope that there will be some results soon.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen certain press reports attributing to Mr Ted Pickering, the New South Wales Minister for Police, a view which is absolute rubbish, absolutely absurd. He claims that the Federal Government will try to ban the possession of guns and firearms in the community by private citizens some time within the next 10 years forever. That is absolute rubbish. It is a patent attempt to divert the anger of New South Wales shooters away from Mr Pickering, who has been so inept in the handling of the gun control question in New South Wales, announcing every six months that New South Wales gun laws are strict but fair and then a few months later changing them, tightening the screws&mdash;no wonder the people in New South Wales are bewildered&mdash;and on to the Federal Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, it is a fact that an employment pamphlet compiled by DEET in South Australia, acting on the advice of those in the gun industry in that State, did purvey that view from those industry sources. It certainly does not represent Federal Government policy in any manner, shape or form. It is not our intention at all to make into criminals those who hold a valid licence to possess and use firearms under State law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the policy of the Federal Government is best demonstrated by my attendance in Hobart on Saturday morning last at the opening training session of a group of people&mdash;dedicated shooters, responsible shooters from various sporting organisations, shooting organisations and clubs State wide&mdash;who came together to spend a weekend undertaking a training course so that they could become instructors. All of those Tasmanians newly applying for a gun licence under the new legislation will receive training and safety instruction, drawing on the experience and skills of these instructors nominated by their various sporting clubs and organisations.

He has organised these gun safety training seminars on behalf of the Tasmanian community. I put it that way because in Tasmania we have come a long way with responsible shooters bearing their responsibility properly. I am quite sure that in the next 10 years we will end up with not the abolition of private gun ownership but an enhancement of that particular sporting, recreational and competitive activity in a way which emphasises safety and responsibility. That is the aim of the Federal Government and that is our only policy in this area.</PARA>

However, let me say that the superannuation guarantee levy, in whatever form it is finally enacted&mdash;and I hope it is in the form that was proposed in the Budget as announced by the Treasurer last year&mdash;will do a number of quite significant things to the benefit of this economy. It will introduce, in the first place, a retirement incomes program which will provide for all Australians at a reasonable standard so that they can retire in dignity, irrespective of whether they are privileged white-collar workers or whether they are not privileged white-collar workers but blue-collar workers. It will create a massive pool of investment in Australian industry, in reserves held by those superannuation funds, and it will be a major social reform.</PARA>

Our wages policy has been one of considerable wage restraint voluntarily entered into by the trade union movement with this Government on the basis of an incomes policy through which taxes have been reduced and the social wage has been improved in compensation for a reduction in real wages, and the living standard has been maintained by and large through the whole course of the period of this Government. That is what a wages policy is about. The Opposition has a free for all wages policy as a result of which, if we go back to the last occasion on which it had an opportunity to implement that policy, we had double digit unemployment, double digit inflation and negative growth.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am sorry; that honour belongs to Senator MacGibbon, because he asked me a question under this portfolio in the last sittings. On 5 June, I announced that an independent review would be held into the Australian advanced air traffic system selection process. I also announced that Mr Pat Brazil, a former Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department, would chair the review and would be assisted in the course of that review by independent specialist advisers on air traffic control systems and on financial issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that announcement, Mr Brazil has withdrawn as chairman of the review because of what he now regards as a possible conflict of interest. For the information of the Senate, I table the letter from Mr Brazil announcing his withdrawal. It states, inter alia, that only after the announcement, to which he had of course agreed, did it become clear that in his legal firm, which involves over 2,000 people including 217 partners throughout Australia and overseas, there may be a possible conflict of interest. As a consequence of that withdrawal, I am moving apace and expect to announce shortly the replacement for Mr Brazil as chairman of the review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the interim, there has been an amount of criticism about this review. It is fair to make the observation that much of the criticism appears not to be about whether the critics want an independent review, but more like the burblings of a lynch mob determined on a victim rather than any real scrutiny and examination in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three particular criticisms have been raised. One is that the terms of reference are not sufficient. On that point, the terms of reference are drawn very broadly indeed. In my view, they are comprehensive enough to involve any of the matters that might be raised. In any case, the independent chairman, when selected, will have an ability to modify those terms of reference to make sure that they do not get in the way of, and/or restrict, his ability to inquire into the subject matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second criticism involves a rumour of who might be the technical expert advising this inquiry. On that subject, the population of companies in this world that are expert in this esoteric area is very small indeed. Because there is only a small number, all of them have had dealings at one time or another with each other and with particular governments on this matter. It seems to me, on the face of it, that none of them has a basis on which they are able to be described as uninvolved at any point in this whole process. Nonetheless, these things will be taken on board. The independent reviewer will be consulted on the selection of the technical advisory people and be responsible for the final outcome of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third criticism has been about the Caesar unto Caesar allegation, that this is a review by the Civil Aviation Authority and that it will report to the Civil Aviation Authority. This will be an independent review. The Civil Aviation Authority board has decided the review should go ahead and supports it, but it will be a genuinely independent review. Naturally, since the Civil Aviation Authority is the statutory body which has the power to make the selection, the review will report to the Civil Aviation Authority. It will report to me as well. The process will be open and transparent and able to be scrutinised in the proper way. I think that in the end it will be a fair and proper process. I hope we can concentrate on getting the inquiry up and running and in due course look at the quality of its product and the findings it makes.</PARA>

According to document No. 1, tabled by the Minister on 4 June, his Department in Canberra knew of Senator Sibraa's involvement in the Marshall Islands affair in November of last year. A senior officer in the Washington Embassy immediately noted that Senator Sibraa's letter raised the possibility of the Government of the Marshall Islands having sought Australian Government assistance. The relevant branch officers in Canberra also recognised that the scheme was fraught with negative potential and that the Department had been dragged in only because of Senator Sibraa's request. According to document No. 56, the Department further knew on 3 April, the day after the arrest of Mr Symons and Mr Finch, that Symons was claiming `political connections in Australia'. According to document No. 8, the Department knew on 6 April that Senator Richardson had written a reference for Mr Symons which had been tabled in court.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The circumstances have been explained about a dozen times as to why there was no particular communication with my office on that subject. The matter was dealt with last November when the letter of introduction from Senator Sibraa resulted in Mr Symons turning up in Washington. He was dealt with in Washington in a way which was absolutely responsible and sensible, in the sense that a judgment was made that this was not an issue in which the Australian Government should involve itself. That was obviously the same judgment that was made by officers in Canberra, who annotated various documents flying backwards and forwards with comments to that effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter was dealt with in a routine way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I assume the honourable senator has raised this issue because there has been some press publicity and comment about it. The Government, unlike the Opposition, is not considering reintroducing the bad old days of the tax-free lunch. Until quite recently, Opposition spokesmen recognised that they were the bad old days. The Government is not considering doing that because we have not threatened the tourism and hospitality industry with a 15 per cent consumption tax and we do not have to go back to tax rorts to undo the damage which a consumption tax would inflict.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasury analysis on this showed that the price of meals out&mdash;that is meals in restaurants and so on&mdash;would go up 11.3 per cent as a result of the GST package. Mr Jull has finally seen that that will not be a good thing for the tourism industry and it has certainly recognised that itself. So he now suggests&mdash;he is the Opposition spokesman on tourism, not ours&mdash;that the Opposition might think about tax deductibility for entertainment expenses. That is an extraordinary suggestion, but it is typical of a number of suggestions which have come from Opposition spokesmen seeking to plug so-called holes in the package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that in 1985 the deductibility of entertainment expenses was estimated to cost revenue about $300m a year. If one were to extrapolate inflation from that period to the present time, the figure would be almost double. So the estimate of Mr Jull's proposal in terms of cost would put a funding hole in the GST package of about $600m a year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a matter of making an attack on anybody; it is a matter of trying to make a constructive contribution from where we stand and with the relationships we have to what is a deeply and seriously intractable problem. I think the situation is best understood in the context in which I described it in a TV interview a couple of days ago when I said that the context, in a nutshell, against which I said what I did was as follows. In the first place we are acutely conscious, as we always have been, of the very great and grave security problems that Israel faces&mdash;both external and internal&mdash;and the need for Israel to have long term guarantees about that security situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we argue&mdash;and I think the rest of the world agrees with us in this respect; indeed, there is a common, united position on this&mdash;that the present peace process that is under way is the best possible way, and probably the only way, of guaranteeing that kind of secure future for Israel. We argue, thirdly&mdash;and I think not naively in this respect&mdash;that there is a constituency for such a peace settlement within the neighbouring Arab countries and within the Palestinian community that has never previously existed. It is a function of lapse of time; it is a function of the end of the Cold War and the realignment of international relationships as a result of that; it is a function, in particular, of the outcome of the Gulf war and the dynamics that have been operating in the region since then. We argue further in that context&mdash;and I put this point in Israel&mdash;that it is tremendously important that every nation in the region do everything possible within its power to assist that particular peace process and not undermine it or set obstacles to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned, as a great many other countries around the world are concerned&mdash;and I can vouch for that on the basis of very direct conversations with some very key Foreign Ministers in that respect&mdash;with the continued, very active program of settlement building not just in East Jerusalem but in many other locations on the West Bank and indeed Gaza; with the policy that is being implemented in the West Bank and Gaza; and with these combined with the kind of approach that Israel has adopted across the conference table. The third mentioned of those things is probably less significant than the other two in the particular timing context we are talking about, with the Israeli elections and so on, but the combination of those three factors has been formidable. And there is a very real prospect, in my judgment and in the judgment of a great many other people around the world, that the peace process will collapse if those obstacles are maintained in the way that is the case at the moment. The fragile constituency of moderates within the Arab nations and within the Palestinian community&mdash;both within Israel and in the Occupied Territories and beyond&mdash;simply cannot be held together if that present conjunction of policy attitudes continues.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that we do have a high participation rate in Australia which is relevant to the question of overall unemployment figures. In so far as youth unemployment is concerned, which Senator Harradine specifically mentioned, there is of course a changing pattern in relation to the activities which young people are engaged in in Australia now from what there was a number of years ago. Now, about seven or eight out of 10 young people in the 15- to 19-year-old age group are in education or training of some kind; two out of 10 are in the work force. The figures which have been given here dramatically today show that one in 10 of that total age cohort seeking work are actually looking for work and of those, varying from State to State, 34 per cent to 43 per cent or 45 per cent&mdash;I think the figures were&mdash;were actually in the category of not having obtained work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the figures. They represent a changing pattern of course in the participation of younger people in various activities from the 1982-83 recession when the number of people unsuccessful in obtaining work&mdash;looking for work and being unsuccessful&mdash;was higher in absolute terms than it is even at the present time. These changes have taken place and they are all relevant to the participation rate. I will see whether I can get further information about that for Senator Harradine.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I first heard this question I was a bit amazed that there was a need to make up a shortfall for award restructuring purposes, because the whole purpose of award restructuring is that the increases paid are met by virtue of the efficiency gains due to award restructuring. I understand that this refers to a broader principle of award restructuring in education than applies elsewhere in the work force. Therefore, I do not know that it is fair for Senator Boswell to include in his question references to annual leave loading, superannuation, long service leave and those other matters that he referred to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I am advised by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training that Commonwealth funding for all non-government schools is linked to a percentage of the community standards test, and that Catholic schools are currently funded at 41 per cent of the community standard, which will increase to 47 per cent of the community standard by the year 2000. The award restructuring assistance program was introduced to provide the Commonwealth's share of the cost of award restructuring. I understand from a chart provided to me by the Department that in 1991 that was an amount of $3.632m and this year it is an amount of $4.838m, making a total over those two years of $8.470m, for the Queensland Catholic school system. In addition, I can inform Senator Boswell that the real increases awarded to Catholic schools every year from 1985 to the year 2000 assist in meeting the costs of award restructuring.</PARA>

The Prime Minister gave an indication, an impression, in his statement of declaration of interest that he had simply a small investment of little consequence, he was not a director of any companies involved and he had no control.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts which have slowly emerged from this matter, despite the fact that there have been no proper company returns from any of the operating companies in this group ever since they were formed&mdash;and about which we have heard nothing from Senator Tate in response to my question a fortnight ago&mdash;and which we have been able to establish quite clearly, are that Mr Keating effectively misled the Parliament by saying very simply, `I have no control and it is simply an investment'. The fact is that his family company has a half interest. He shares ownership and de facto control of Euphron Pty Limited which has a direct involvement through Brown and Hatton in this pig operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only that but Mr Keating, while technically not a director of Euphron, has appointed a nominee, the company secretary of Pleuron, to be the director on his behalf in Euphron, despite the fact that the person involved, Mr Coudounaris, has not one share and has no interest whatsoever in either Pleuron or Euphron. Here we have a situation where the Prime Minister has a direct and significant interest, has a nominee on the board, yet misleads the Parliament by pretending that the investment he has is something like a few shares in BHP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason this is significant is that we now have an admission that he did have conversations with the Danish people in not only his private capacity but also the capacity in which he was acting when in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> he announced the change in foreign investment review policy:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the thresholds, below which foreign investment proposals are not examined in certain sectors of the economy, set out below, are increased to $50m, from below $3m for rural properties. . . </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will cease to examine proposals by foreign interests. . . in the sectors set out below. . . or establishment of a new business with a total investment of less than $50m.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the proposals set out below are rural properties and agriculture. The One Nation statement, which was issued just three months ago in February 1992, went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The liberalisation of the foreign investment guidelines will lead to new projects being established in the economy which would otherwise have started later, or not at all.</PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to note that Mr Keating took out his interest in this pig operation in May 1991 while he was still Treasurer and the Minister in charge of the Foreign Investment Review Board. I wonder whether he was acting in his private capacity as a beneficial owner of a large slice of this pig operation when in the One Nation statement he changed the guidelines which exempted this matter from FIRB review or in his position as the Prime Minister of Australia. I wonder when he was talking to Mr Jacobsson whether he had the capacity to change hats with the same skill as he demonstrates when he enters this Parliament. </PARA>

So when Senator Button responds to the points that Senator Baume made, I ask him to take up this very important issue. He mentioned that he has spoken to the Prime Minister about his contact with Mr Jacobsson and Mr Toernaes. I also ask Senator Button to ascertain whether Brown and Hatton is bringing in any breeding material. Also, has Brown and Hatton made any application, or does it intend to apply, to bring any live pigs to Australia? If so, that would suggest a process that bypasses any normal quarantine procedures.

Those opposite have said, `The Labor Party is a party where nobody is supposed to be wealthy. The Labor Party is a party that should not encourage enterprise in spite of its record and the fact that it does. Therefore, if we point out that this Prime Minister has money; if we point out that this Prime Minister has invested in industry; if we point out that this Prime Minister, through his own efforts, has made money and invested it in a successful enterprise, that will somehow be looked upon by Australians as wrong'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, what I find fascinating is that this Prime Minister refers to John Hewson as `a traitor to his class'. He draws a distinction between having a Ferrari in the garage and a mantelpiece covered in French clocks as if one is respectable and one is not. The only difference is that John Hewson has not sold a Ferrari to Warren Anderson, it is still in his garage, and he sure did not make any capital gains tax from leaving it there. Perhaps driving a Ferrari suits him and perhaps having a pig farm suits the Prime Minister of those opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at the economic record of this Government. We have a Prime Minister who, during his period as Treasurer, managed to make himself a multi-millionaire while at the same time creating a million unemployed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not intend to enter this debate, but I think it is important to make clear a few matters. The constant allegation that has come from the other side is that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has somehow been disguising his business affairs&mdash;I think that was a term actually used by Senator Crichton-Browne&mdash;but, in fact, as far as the parliamentary registration of his interests is concerned, it is perfectly in order and impeccable, and he has made it known to the electors of Australia precisely what his interest is.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Prime Minister's family company, Pleuron, was said to have been late in the lodging of its returns. Some associated companies in which investments were held by Pleuron were also mentioned.

That will be the case, even in relation to the piggery. Questions such as the environmental impact statement will be considered, which was the concern of somebody on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. All that will be undertaken because the Prime Minister, through various companies, is engaged in trying to create a situation which will be wealth producing for Australia and will involve investment in very high technology, added to our natural advantage relating to primary industry. Food technology is a way in which Australia can create wealth, can earn export dollars and can have import substitution, which provides for jobs within Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I have never before heard Senator Tate either so obtuse or so deliberate in his refusal to deal with the substance of a matter. The substance of this matter is not what he pretends it to be. The substance of this matter is the potential for conflict of interest which has in fact gone beyond potential to an actual conflict of interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate is not about whether the project is good or bad, and Senator Tate's attempt to establish it as such was pathetic and childish. I cannot believe he would even try to do that. But he must have his own motives. Whatever they are, they are not ones that bring him any credit.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue concerns the question of the conflict of interest of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who holds, in a deceptive way, a major interest&mdash;which he pretends is not major&mdash;in, and who pretends that he does not have a director on the board of, Euphron. This is the issue. When he introduces changes in One Nation and to the FIRB requirements from which he will get a clear benefit, this is also the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People can ask, `Where did he get the money?'. That is a fair question. People who work as parliamentarians all of their lives are unlikely to end up with a spare $500,000 to whack into a family company to whack into a pig interest. But maybe some people have outside interests and, as well as being Treasurers of the nation for eight years, manage to be far more effective in their investments than they are in handling the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That may be the situation, but the fact is that this is a serious question of conflict of interest. It is extraordinary that two matters are being raised. One of them is this question of class war: why are we attacking poor, innocent Paul Keating for being rich? That is not the issue. Paul Keating has been attacking non-stop John Hewson and John Howard for being traitors to their class, while he has just been outed as a closet millionaire. That is the hypocrisy of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say one thing about Senator Button's extraordinary contribution. He said that everything was on the public record; there was nothing that was not readily available. That is just bunkum. There was nothing in Mr Keating's declaration of interest to indicate his holding in Brown and Hatton. There was nothing in his declaration of interest to indicate that he would get a benefit from a multi-million dollar joint deal with a multinational&mdash;no indication whatsoever. For Senator John Button to pretend that this information was readily available is in fact entering into the same sort of high farce with which Senator Tate just entertained us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that there was deliberately no indication to the people of Australia that the Prime Minister would stand to benefit from this multi-million dollar multinational deal. If it had not been for our searching of mountains of available material&mdash;most of it was not available, of course; but what was available through the Australian Securities Commission and through all of those corporate searches&mdash;we would not have managed to find out what share issues had been made. We do not have the full story because the returns are not there. They have never been submitted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the issue that Senator Tate tries to keep ducking. He deliberately chose to avoid answering the section of my question which contained detailed substance about the companies in the group which had not put in returns for three years. He chose not to do that. I wonder why a man of Senator Tate's integrity would magically decide that that section of the question&mdash;which was the first thing asked&mdash;would not be responded to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who is the Minister who represents the ASC in this chamber? It is Senator Tate. He was capable of establishing pronto the state of the small family investment companies of various people in the Opposition. He was capable of establishing that pronto. But as for answering a question of substance about what the Government was going to do; or whether the Government was going to get the ASC to do anything about companies that have never submitted a proper return&mdash;I use the word `proper' because one of them submitted an unsatisfactory return&mdash;we have not heard a squeak out of Senator Tate. He comes in here endeavouring to be all sweetness, reasonableness and light and deliberately decides not to pursue this matter of substance because it would seriously affect the status and standing of his Prime Minister in the community. That is what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the exercise we have seen here today is almost as disgraceful as the Prime Minister's own activities. The Government has sought to cloud the issue with absolute nonsense. It has tried to generate other major issues, saying that we are attacking this industry. We have not established or even argued whether this industry would be a good or a bad one for Australia. What we have sought to establish is that the Prime Minister has a conflict of interest. That is clear and unarguable, and that is presumably why honourable senators opposite did not argue it, why they raised side issues, why they sought to mislead the public once again. They cannot answer the basic issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Prime Minister misled the people of Australia in his declaration of interest. As we have seen, these declarations are totally phoney at the other end. He stood to gain a benefit from the change in the One Nation statement and did not disclose his interest. When I heard Senator Button say, `Oh, this is nothing of significance', I was reminded of similar comments from the Government at the time we raised the Mr Burke issue. For months senators on this side of the chamber asked non-stop questions about Mr Burke and were continually assured, `This is not a matter of substance'. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the documents.</PARA>
<PARA>These are an important series of questions and answers. They were asked on 1 June. Senator McMullan gave an undertaking on that day to have the answers made available as soon as possible. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Tambling was asking for prospective information&mdash;information available when certain things are concluded. I cannot give him a time commitment on that but I will be as prompt as I can be. For that which already exists, I will do my best to make sure that it is available this week.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, Senator McMullan obviously was not able to make that information available in the last sitting week. As I said earlier, I was informed by a departmental officer this morning that Senator McMullan would be tabling the questions at the end of Question Time today, which would have enabled me to then take the action I am now taking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley did ask earlier whether I had sought the normal courtesies of consultation. I indicate that at the end of Question Time I approached the portfolio Minister, Senator Collins, and indicated to him that I was proposing to speak on the particular questions and answers, and asked him to acquaint Senator McMullan of any of the portfolio issues that might subsequently arise. I subsequently telephoned Senator McMullan's office and spoke to the Labor Party Whip, Senator Jones, about this matter before I raised it with you, Mr Deputy President. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue that I want to address is that, whilst there is a lot of information on the shareholding and ownership of the proposed casino on Christmas Island, a couple of the answers give me cause for concern: firstly, with regard to a question that originally appeared in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on page 3186, part of the answer relating to investigations by the Australian Federal Police be made available to the Committee or an appropriate Senate committee. The answer, in part, reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Department has contacted the Australian Federal Police and the National Crime Authority with regard to releasing their reports in relation to this project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both have provided advice that it would be inappropriate to do so on confidentiality and privacy grounds.</PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, with regard to a question originally asked in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on page 3187, relating to investigations of the Australian Federal Police concerning any current activities of principals of the proposed project, a similar answer was given:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As stated in the previous answer, the Australian Federal Police and the National Crime Authority have  provided  advice  that  it  would  be inappropriate to do so on confidentiality and privacy grounds.</PARA>
<PARA>I noted an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of Monday 16 June under the heading `Work halts on Island Casino'. The issues raised in that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> article are very important. The first two paragraphs state:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Indonesian backers of a $48m casino development on Christmas Island shut down the site of the nearly complete project at the weekend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The move is believed to be at least partly in response to the WA Gaming Commission's decision to hold an inquiry into the suitability of the project's backers to hold a casino licence.</PARA>
<PARA>The article then pursues a number of other issues relating to the building, project activity and the inquiries and various reviews that the Federal Government is obviously now undertaking in the answers to these questions provided to me today. Some of the information that appears in that article has also somehow been made available either to the journalist or to other interested parties in advance of it being made available in the Senate, as I would have thought would have been the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project on Christmas Island is an important one and it has been ongoing. The answers to many of these questions set out very detailed consideration of the overseas foreign ownership of the casino and the various reviews and processes of approval by a number of Federal Government Ministers over the past few years. This, in turn, raises a series of questions that should now be asked. What are the implications of the stopped work on the building site for the Government's proposed expenditure of $132m on a community infrastructure program, which was recently approved by the Federal Cabinet and is subject to current consideration by the Public Works Committee? What are the implications for the legislation which is currently before the Senate and which drastically alters the legal regimes that are to apply to Christmas and Cocos Islands from 1 July, if the legislation passes this Parliament next week, as is the current program?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we also need to know what assurances, agreements and deals have been struck between the Labor Government, the Indonesian casino developers and Christmas Island Resorts Pty Ltd. In particular, in view of the information that is now obviously before the Government and the Department, is it proposed to alter any of the existing agreements in light of the information that has been given to the Australian Federal Police, the Foreign Investment Review Board or the National Crime Authority? These are issues that certainly arise from these questions and answers. I hope that in the course of this week and next week the Government will be in a position to make a statement on the future of Christmas Island, the future monitoring of the gaming activities on that island and the future of the tourist development that is to take place. </PARA>

<PARA>The Government parades the great virtue of its requirement on Ministers to make declarations of their private interests and those of their spouses. Yet we have seen again today how easily the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been able to run rings around that requirement and how lacking in any transparency he has been with his own personal return. The value or otherwise of declarations such as these has to be assessed in the light of those other people in the political process who have no such requirement to lodge a public return, but who exercise enormous power in the political process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn, for example, to journalists who have enormous power and the ability to present an issue or an individual, or, indeed, by smothering a story to bury an issue or an individual, so that the nation can be very ill-informed or even misinformed. When it comes to journalists, their financial, their personal or their spousal connections can be of enormous importance in assessing what they have written, the influence they exercise, and who is related to whom by one means or by another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example of a very cosy, financial connection of the media with business, rather than in the political scene, was demonstrated last night by Stuart Littlemore in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Media Watch</EMPHASIS>, in relation to the special editorial page benefits given to Ford in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Herald</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>, to L. J. Hooker in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS>, and Carlton and United Breweries in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>. This was all apparently in exchange for advertising arrangements. How can there be any expectation that this special treatment that is given to commercial organisations is not also handed out to political friends and favourites?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exercise of power in the political process does not stop with the media. Unseen, except perhaps on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS>, is the army of influential decision makers in the Public Service&mdash;those who boast that governments come and governments go but they go on for ever. These are the people who actually decide the mass of government contracts, for example&mdash;the procurement contracts and the construction contracts. Yet we know nothing of their financial interests or those of their spouses. Many ministerial staff are also in influential positions and very likely to so position their Ministers that decisions are made in accordance with their staff's recommendations. Yet we know nothing of the staff's connections or interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I point to the growing band of consultants, one of the most recent of which has been the appointment of Dr Anne Summers as a consultant to the Prime Minister on women's issues. Dr Summers was recently described by a friend in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What's important for her is to be close to power. It's not so important to her what the person in power thinks because you can always manipulate that.</PARA>
<PARA>Richard Farmer has also been quoted as saying that Dr Summers will have a massive influence on what Labor does between now and the next election. The Prime Minister is to be manipulated and massively influenced, yet we will have nothing on the private interests of Anne Summers. Consultants of such acknowledged power go unscrutinised while the Government gives itself credit for making public the interests of the puppets. Meanwhile, we know nothing of the puppeteers or the Svengalis of the Government. Perhaps when proper attention is given to these matters, the returns of Ministers will be given more credit than they currently are. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of returns of private interests of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries is of some concern. Clearly, the object is to provide the people of Australia with information about the potential conflict of interest of their Ministers. I understand that was why the Government introduced it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, there is no indication here of the significance of the holding of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the pig empire that is now entering a multi-million dollar scheme with a multinational company. Senator Button has said that the scheme was approved by the FIRB before the One Nation package got rid of the limited requirement under which such a scheme would have to get FIRB approval. From this declaration of interest, we have not the vaguest idea that the Prime Minister had any involvement whatsoever in these matters&mdash;in the multinational deal or in Brown and Hatton. It would not have emerged but for a whole series of searches of company records. Almost every one of the companies involved changed their name at some stage or another. There is simply no indication in this return of the significance or otherwise of Mr Keating's holding in pigs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know to what extent it is significant that the Prime Minister should have a bank bill from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. I guess mortgages and bank overdrafts are the normal sorts of things people have. What interests me is that one of the companies in which he has a major interest, the Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd, formerly Denvalt Pty Ltd, had a significant indebtedness in 1989&mdash;we do not know what has happened since because we have not had a return&mdash;to the Commonwealth Bank one way or another, by way of a bank bill, which I understand was converted into a $1.5m mortgage by way of re-financing. What emerges from this is that the applicant company, as part of the mortgage documents, undertakes as proposed to reduce overall trading bank borrowing by $3,120,000 gross by the sale of three piggery companies situated near Tamworth, New South Wales, among other things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We simply do not know whether, in fact, this group in which the Prime Minister has such a major investment is also very heavily indebted to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. In other words, is there a potential for conflict of interest here as well? It is quite clear that we get no indication whatsoever from these declarations of interest. As I said earlier, surely it seems important that if this Government really believes in these declarations of interest, it should make them meaningful. If Mr Keating has a half-interest in the company which is a major investor in the Brown and Hatton group, then that half-interest surely should be declared, as should be the fact that he has a nominee on the board of that company&mdash;as I said, a nominee who has no beneficial interest in the matter whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until these declarations of interest are meaningful, they may as well not exist. That, of course, was the position we took at the time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The Advance to the Minister for Finance for May of this year shows that an amount of approximately $20m is being sought. That is, again, a very significant amount, although it pales into insignificance when compared with the $80m that was sought in April. I do not propose to go through all the items in the May advance, but there are one or two to which I particularly wish to draw attention. The most significant of those, not in money terms but in terms of requiring an explanation, is an amount of $400,000 being paid through the Advance to the Minister for Finance to Ausmusic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Senate may recall, Ausmusic is an organisation that was set up back in about 1988. Ausmusic, which stands for Australian Contemporary Music Development Company, was established by the Department of Employment, Education and Training in June 1988 as a non-profit company for the development of the Australian contemporary music industry. Since June 1988, Ausmusic has received a total of $1.65m in Commonwealth funding from the DEET portfolio through the training aspects of its charter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Government recently decided to transfer responsibility for assistance to Ausmusic from DEET to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. The application for funds from the Advance to the Minister for Finance states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following this transfer, Government also agreed to provide $400,000 in additional funding to Ausmusic in 1991/92, subject to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce being satisfied with Ausmusic's business plan in relation to the use of the additional funds. That plan has now been received and accepted.</PARA>
<PARA>The application goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As both of the Government decisions concerning Ausmusic were finalised following the additional estimates process, this proposal clearly meets the unforeseen criteria. The matter is now urgent as Ausmusic will cease trading if funds are not received before the end of the current financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, as Cabinet specifically agreed to provide the additional funding in 1991/92, AMF remains the only funding source available.</PARA>
<PARA>That is quite an extraordinary application because, although I have not had time to check out the full details, my recollection of the matter is that the Parliament was told some time ago that Ausmusic was to become self-sufficient in its funding. It was originally provided interim funding only on the basis that it would eventually become self-sufficient with money raised from the blank tape levy. That has since been the subject of a High Court challenge which has prevented Ausmusic receiving funding from this source. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's report No. 7 of 1991-92 expressed concern about the Ausmusic company. It found that, unless Ausmusic received continued funding, it would be forced to go into voluntary liquidation. It said that it would require a Government policy decision on whether it wanted to continue funding. It appears that the Government has taken that policy decision, but it also appears that that decision has been taken in the dark without any announcement publicly&mdash;or certainly not to this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Executive Director of Ausmusic is Mr Peter Steedman, the former member for Casey in Victoria, and a member of the very hard Left of the Victorian Labor Party. He has been in that position now for several years. In fact, I think he was the inaugural Executive Director. It is about time that the Government came clean and told this Parliament and this Senate how long it proposes to continue to allow Ausmusic to run on the public purse. It is obviously not a viable operation of itself, and what it is doing for Australian contemporary music is highly questionable. There is no evidence that it is doing anything at all in that respect. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to speak to the Advance to the Minister for Finance and to note that in it the Australian National Maritime Museum has been obliged to seek a substantial increase in funding for a variety of reasons, which is of course unfortunate. As the document explains, the National Maritime Museum is seeking funds to cover a shortfall in revenue, unexpected maintenance costs and higher than anticipated exhibition fit-out costs. This was evident some time ago and was raised in Senate Estimates hearings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the document indicates, the shortfall in revenue is due to a lower than anticipated visitation level since opening on 30 November 1991. Visitor numbers and revenue are only around 50 per cent of the original estimate. We know that there is a recession in Australia and that New South Wales is the State least affected, judging by unemployment figures. It seems extraordinary in those circumstances that there should be such a dramatically lower than anticipated visitation figure. I wonder on what basis a forecast of visitors was made that was so dramatically wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, I have a high regard for the National Maritime Museum and I am a member of it. I wish more Australians would go to see this significant place. But I am very concerned that the basis on which funding has been given was obviously in expectation of substantial numbers of visitations which simply have not taken place. The Government and the museum itself must address this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that really concerns me even more about this substantial additional fund requirement of more than half a million dollars&mdash;$572,000&mdash;is that unavoidable extra maintenance costs are associated with the museum. The document states that the work is for `essential maintenance for the proper preservation and functioning of the Commonwealth's asset'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is simply the latest instalment of extraordinary cost burdens in the construction and now the maintenance of this museum. It was grossly unfair that the New South Wales Greiner Government had to pick up the bill of about $40m as a result of an agreement made by a previous Labor Minister for works with the Commonwealth to construct this building for the Commonwealth at a fixed price. That fixed price was massively overrun. The taxpayers of New South Wales had to pick up that bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is now a much higher maintenance bill. I regret that the amounts relating to both the higher maintenance and the volume of shortfall of tenancies are not stated in this request for additional money. We have a continuing problem with public works which may be seen to be exciting and grand in conception but in which there has not been proper regard for financial restraint and the harbouring of financial resources. </PARA>

All we can hope is that this very expensive asset, which is costing so much more to maintain than expected, will one way or another attract a greater number of visitors. I hope that the Board of the National Maritime Museum, which has some outstanding Australians on it, will be able to address this matter effectively. It is not good enough for this kind of half a million dollar handout to take place in a situation in which the Government is finding it has more and more people unemployed and in need of major assistance. It is a vital matter that organisations such as this should one way or another be pulling their weight rather than demanding more and more out of the public purse.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been put to me that this occurred 20 or 25 years ago with regard to John McEwen House and the National Party. I am quite aware of that; I think everyone is aware of it. But it is a different climate. The question I raised, again with this gentleman Mr Seccombe with his half-smart article, was what his reaction would be if a couple of years ago the National Party Government in Queensland had put a major government department into Bjelke-Petersen House. There would be people quite rightly protesting about that. There would be journalists crying `foul' and `corrupt'. Yet what is the difference? I submit to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that there is no difference. Hence, the first item that I wish to refer to the Committee: the probity and propriety of accommodating government departments in property owned by the political party of the government in power. That must be determined. When the Democrats come in here they start talking about ethics, yet I do not believe they will support the motion to refer this matter to a committee. I will come to that in a minute because I suspect I know why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we talk about the process of negotiation leading up to and the terms and conditions of the agreement for lease between the Commonwealth and John Curtin House. When the conditions became known we were more concerned. When we have an oversupply of property, when there is a recession, and when, as a result of that recession we had to have, we have an incredibly high unemployment rate&mdash;brought about by this Government and in particular the ex-Treasurer and now Prime Minister, Mr Keating&mdash;we see that there is an agreement that runs for 15 years. That is very unusual. I do not think there is another instance of a Commonwealth government renting or leasing property for that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lease agreement provided for some $1.8m in rent, retrospective to 1 January 1991. What that means, of course, is that the rent increases at 10.5 per cent per annum going back to January 1991 until the date of completion, and from then on at the rate, I think, of 9 per cent for the balance of the 15 years. But there is more. The tenant, the Auditor-General, is to pay all the outgoings to the owner, which is the Australian Labor Party, for the full period. There is a provision in the contract to look at the market after five years. If the market rate is higher, the tenant will pay more, but if it is lower, the tenant will not pay less rent; the tenant will pay continuing increases in rent at 9 per cent per annum. Is it any wonder that we have expressed concern, not only about the probity of the matter but also about the terms and conditions? I challenge anyone in this place to talk to anyone in the community about a deal at $1.8m a year guaranteed with a 10.5 per cent escalation going backwards in time to 1 January 1991 and then a 9 per cent increase plus paying all outgoings. That is a bankable contract; that is like money in the bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final item was whether the process of negotiation of those terms and conditions was in accordance with the principles that should govern dealings between the Government and private bodies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Senator Brownhill. As a national organisation the Democrats are entitled to that, the same as any other organisation. But there are certain conditions relating to it. The Democrats were given a block of land in 1986. That is fair enough, if it was to be used for the head office of the Democrats, but we find that the person who was responsible at that time for the purchases of the Democrats was a senator-elect, one Sid Spindler. He went off and spoke to a group around town. They negotiated and got into a deal. The deal was that the Democrats would sell their block of land, with a 99-year lease, for $1m&mdash;a $1m profit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the people who came in here to keep everyone honest, honourable senators might recall. Is this the reason they do not want to support this motion&mdash;because they do not want this sort of thing to come out, to be regurgitated, during the investigations by the Committee? They may well come in here and argue, `This is not new; we have argued this one before'. Yes, they have, but let me remind honourable senators what it was. If it were just a case of getting rid of the property, one could say, `Okay', but the Democrats found that, if they were not careful, they would have to pay capital gains tax. The Democrats went to extraordinary lengths&mdash;these people who are in here to keep everyone honest&mdash;to avoid paying capital gains tax. There was a wonderful interview in October 1988 between Senator-elect Spindler and Pru Goward when she said to Mr Spindler:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Okay, you've made a million dollars out of it. . .</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Spindler said, `Well, there's nothing wrong with that. We've still achieved the purpose for which it was given to us. We are going to get a little bit of space in it which we can use'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another requirement if one goes down this track and gets such a property in the Australian Capital Territory, and that is, some 50 per cent of the building has to be occupied by the original person who was granted the lease, or by a similar non-profit organisation. This would have meant not a very good deal for the Australian Democrats who, we know, are so scrupulously honest. They did not want to do anything but avoid a bit of tax and maximise the amount of money they would get from the sale of this property. They entered into a devious method and a company, AD Pty Ltd&mdash;I suppose the AD is short for Australian Democrats&mdash;made some payment to the developer over a 10-year period which avoided the capital gains tax. But, more importantly, they wrote to the government of the day and said, `Would you absolve us from the requirement of 50 per cent occupancy because we can get a better deal?' The government of the day wrote back and said, `Yes, we can make it 35 per cent'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that must be raised is whether the Democrats are occupying the 35 per cent&mdash;which, incidentally, must become 50 per cent after eight years, to go back to the original purpose&mdash;or whether they are in breach. I do not know the answer to that, but it puts the question in my mind as to why they are not supporting this motion to refer what I believe is a very important matter to a standing committee for report back to the Parliament in the first week in August. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to keep this chamber much longer. We are going to be running short of time for the debating of legislation. However, I again point out to those people who are interested in this matter that here we have something which I believe is against everything that is right. It is an attack on probity and propriety. A government department&mdash;it does not matter which one in fact&mdash;has been put into premises owned by the Australian Labor Party under the most generous terms and conditions that I have seen in recent months, whether it be the ACT or any other capital city in Australia. The beneficiary is undoubtedly the ALP.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a concept in this Parliament of parliamentary privilege. It is interesting to refer to that for a minute, because I am genuinely irate about this.

There are a lot of people out in the community who have been involved in this process, in this leasing arrangement, who are decent honest people&mdash;whether they have been involved in organising or in building the project. I can understand why they are concerned at the moment at the buckets coming up from the other side on this. I say to them that there is a concept of parliamentary privilege. Page 633 of Odgers states the position quite clearly. I think it is worth putting this on the record. I contend that we as parliamentarians have not only rights but also responsibilities. One of those responsibilities is to get to the truth. Odgers states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the purpose of privilege is to enable Members fearlessly to speak their minds, it is not to be taken that the law of privilege confers complete immunity on a Member of Parliament in respect of anything said or done by him in the course of proceedings in Parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`Who said that?', asks Senator Parer. What I suggest Senator Parer does before he comes into this place and debates anything again is to read his own press statements. On 15 January this year he called it `Labor's Fifteen Year Rort'. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is pressuring the Australian National Audit Office to relocate to the new ALP headquarters. . .</PARA>
<PARA>That was in the press statement of 15 January. Not to be outdone, on 2 June he put out a press statement entitled, rather curiously, `ALP favours itself in lease to Government'. One cannot understand what that means, other than to infer that the Labor Party is doing deals for itself. It then went on to accuse the Government of impropriety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people accuse the Government, the Labor Party, it is pretty clear that they are accusing those in ministerial positions. The truth, and Senator Parer knows it well&mdash;it has been driven down his throat so many times in the last process that we had&mdash;is that not one Minister, not one Parliamentary Secretary, has been involved in this process. That is an established fact and it is something that Senator Parer knows. But it does not stop him from going out there and distorting the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been established, for instance, that I knew of this particular proposal the day after Senator Parer put out his first press statement on 15 January. The advice I have had from my Department is that both formally and informally it had not brought it to my attention, and that is already on the public record. It is already on the public record that Senator McMullan was not involved at any time in this particular process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So despite there being absolutely no evidence to confirm or to support the proposal that Ministers have applied pressure regarding this proposal, we got a press statement which is totally full of lies. There is absolutely no respect for the truth; there is absolutely no respect for the public interest; and there is absolutely no respect for honesty in debate. It is no wonder that out there people are saying to Senator Parer and his colleagues, `Get back on the main game'. So there has been a dishonest abuse of the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us accept&mdash;we should not accept any other assertion on this point&mdash;that there has been no political involvement or intervention. There has been nothing to indicate that there has been. Let us see whether there was any other irregularity. Let us see whether, as Senator Parer says, what we are talking about here, as he put out in his press statement on 15 January, is a `deal of incredibly generous conditions'. On 15 January he also made the assertion that `the Government is prepared to turn a blind eye to the issues of conflict of interest, probity and honesty'. Those are the charges made. Again, on 2 June he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . terms and conditions were extremely favourable to the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA>He made another assertion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . 15 years which is unheard of for a Government building. . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to call this an unprecedented leasing arrangement. He waffles on saying, `They are, they are'. Two contentions are made here. Essentially, the first is that these are extremely generous conditions and the second is that there is some degree of impropriety. The second point is extremely easy to dismiss, because nothing has been adduced by the Opposition&mdash;and nothing has come out of the copious documents that the Government has been willing to table&mdash;that would lend any support to that proposition at all. The honourable senator knows it. Why does he not just give up on it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go to the other point about generous conditions. What has been established quite convincingly here is a normal commercial proposition carried out by honest people without interference. It is and was a normal business arrangement. The truth is that Senator Parer should give it a break and get back to the real issues of the day. No wonder the Opposition's reputation is going down. I must say once again that I really feel sorry for those people out in the electorate who are involved in this. Quite respectable people from Lend Lease who have organised this, property managers in my Department and those who are doing the building are being besmirched by this bucket which has been thrown by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the process and the details of the proposal. The land in question was purchased and sold to the Labor Party by a Kaine Liberal government in the ACT not for $1m but, I am told, for some $2.2m, half a million dollars of which was to go to off-site preparations. That should be placed on the public record. This has been conveniently ignored by the Opposition when it tries to build its little castles in the air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the process. Between 27 October and 14 November 1990 expressions of interest were invited for a 3,000 to 8,000 square metre office block. The closing date was 16 November. The Department received 14 responses, one of which arrived on 15 November. That was from Lend Lease on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. But, as I said earlier, the Liberal Party beat us to the punch by some two or three days. Tony Eggleton got its proposition in on 13 November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 21 November a brief was sent to the National Audit Office detailing the expressions received. One on the list was the Lend Lease proposal on behalf of the ALP. But, as we established in the previous debate on this matter some two or three weeks ago, Domonic Collins&mdash;who has now retired but who was handling this matter for the Australian Property Group&mdash;advised that he withheld that proposition from the list to the National Audit Office because he wanted to avoid a `dutch auction' by the potential tenants. Eight days later, on 29 November, the 14 propositions were presented to the Australian National Audit Office and thereafter everything proceeded on the basis that there were 14 propositions on the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some point has been made about whether the National Audit Office did or did not know&mdash;and if so, when it knew&mdash;whether the Labor Party was behind the Lend Lease proposal. As I said on 28 May in this place:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am informed by my Department, and through it by National Audit officers, that they recall discussing the proposal at a meeting on 29 November 1990, which is some two weeks after the close of expressions of interest. The Audit Office people cannot say whether the ALP involvement was discussed or not. However, they indicated that they also do not recall learning anything about it later, although clearly they did know about it by March 1991 and did not consider it a concern. I am advised that they probably did know at the November 1990 meeting about the ALP involvement in the proposal. At all material times they were aware of it. As I say, they did not consider it a concern.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for that particular point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that should be made is that it was the Australian National Audit Office itself which chose the particular site. This was pretty well documented in this place on 28 May and on days around that time. One of the reasons the National Audit Office chose it is reflected very clearly and simply in a report of this Parliament&mdash;the 296th report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. On page 246 of that report the Committee made it very clear that there was some merit in the proposal. The Committee recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Audit Office plan for a new building either within the Parliamentary Triangle or on State Circle adjacent to the new Parliament House, and that the building be called Audit House.</PARA>
<PARA>A Committee of this Parliament felt it was important for the National Audit Office to have a building in the Parliamentary Triangle or on State Circle, and this Lend Lease-Labor Party proposition was the one that fitted within the requirements. The Audit Office made the choice, independent of ministerial interference. There was none, and the property was chosen on good grounds and for good reasons. The other ground on which the property was chosen, and on which my Department advised that it should be taken, was the proposal that was put to the Audit Office. It was a good commercial transaction, as I say, with no external interference. We are talking about an arrangement that was entered into some 12 months ago in a different market. On 8 April 1992 the final documents were signed by AGS on behalf of the National Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the details of the proposal to lease. It was alleged by Senator Parer in his press statement of 15 January 1992 that `it is incredibly generous'. On 2 June 1992 he called it an `unprecedented lease arrangement'. As I said earlier, in his press statement on 2 June he continued to assert that the terms and conditions were extremely favourable to the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us just look at them. Let us see the reality of the situation. Let us see the degree of distortion that the Opposition is involved in.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then Senator Parer went on to mention rental growth rates.

On what basis did officers of this Department and the National Audit Office make their assessment and come to a decision? The Senate knows already because we went through it last time.

The rate is 10.5 per cent until construction completion, which should be within the next eight or nine months or so, and 9 per cent thereafter for at least the first four years. That is not generous. It is within the advice of the Department and the Australian Valuation Office. What is the public told about this? This is quite amazing. The public is told that this is a generous deal. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is in direct contrast to a lease signed recently for a prime site in Collins Street Melbourne of similar size for about $150 a square metre without any incentives, rent holidays or assistance for fit-out.</PARA>
<PARA>That is from a press statement of 2 June from this financial wizard from the Opposition. No wonder the Opposition is looking shaky! Any mug in the market knows that the vacancy rates in Melbourne, Perth and Sydney are about 25 per cent. Anyone who is about to go into an arrangement in the ACT would know that the vacancy rates here are one-eighth of the vacancy rates in Melbourne, Sydney or Perth. They are 3 or 4 per cent. That has to have some impact on the price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have thought that someone who professes to have had experience in the private sector could see that there would be a difference between leasing a property in Collins Street, Melbourne, where the vacancy rate is 25 per cent, and in Barton, Canberra, where it is 3 or 4 per cent.

The land in the golden triangle that is granted as a lease to national organisations which represent a significant section of the electorate, and that includes political parties, is for the very specific purpose of establishing and running in that building a national secretariat.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;The two honourable senators who have just spoken are both overpaid. Senator Bolkus came in here earlier and made all sorts of counterclaims about a matter that definitely must be raised by people in the Parliament. It is about probity and propriety. It is about whether an incumbent government in this climate displays probity and propriety, bearing in mind what we have seen in recent years by a few politicians&mdash;I say `a few'; it is by far a minority&mdash;who have brought the Parliament into disrepute. I might say&mdash;and I think I made this remark in previous debates in this place&mdash;that it could well be that we are at a stage where, irrespective of whether it is a good deal or a bad deal, an incumbent government cannot even contemplate going down this sort of track. That is the sort of situation that prevails in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that this deal is a particularly good deal. I do not know anyone involved in any of these businesses who would not grab this with both hands&mdash;a 15-year lease and 10.5 per cent. It is all very well for Senator Bolkus to say that growth rates are projected to be higher. We talk about rates of return. We are talking about an inflation rate which is down because of a recession we had to have, from a Prime Minister we did not want. Hopefully, one of the things that may come out of this is continuing low inflation. Yet we see a deal done which has a guaranteed a 9 per cent inflation rate for the balance of the contract. That is per annum; the rent goes up every year 9 per cent from the date of completion of the building. It is 10.5 per cent retrospective to 1 January last year, even though the deal was made only in the last month or two months. </PARA>

John Curtin House is currently, with the escalation figure, about $320. Senator Bolkus said $302, but if we take 10.5 per cent of the lease plus the outgoings&mdash;Senator Bolkus conveniently forgot the darned outgoings; it is an easy one to forget, is it not?&mdash;we end up with a figure currently, with the first year's escalation, of about $358 a square metre.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questions I am asking are, firstly, is it right and proper for an incumbent government in 1992 to contemplate putting a major government department within premises owned by the Australian Labor Party? Maybe the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration will say it is. Secondly, was the process of negotiation on the terms and conditions proper? I do not know, but the Committee will probably find that it was. Thirdly, were the terms and conditions in accordance with principles which should govern dealings between the Government and private bodies? In other words, was it a good deal or a bad deal? There are two quite distinct issues: the first deals with the probity and proprietary of doing it and the second is whether it was not a good deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, as Senator Bolkus says, there is no problem and it is all above board, why is the Government opposed to sending it off to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration to report back by August? That question has not been addressed. I still believe that we have to go back to the probity and propriety of the matter. As I pointed out earlier, I think the general public is at a stage, because of a few bad apples that run around this country, where it is not prepared to accept that at this time in history and probably well into the future. I believe that this motion should be supported and that this matter should go off to a committee which could report back in August, at which time the whole thing would be put to rest. </PARA>

<PARA>That is the debate about urgency. At the end of practically every session now, the Australian Democrats conspire with the Government to curtail debate on critical legislation. This is despite the Democrats year after year promising that they will never do it again; that they will support freedom of speech in this chamber; and that they recognise that this is the only chamber in which there is any real legislative accountability. Despite those promises, time and again at this stage of the session they conspire with the Government to lock us out of the proper opportunity to debate these matters.

Thirty-four per cent of young Australians seeking jobs cannot get jobs. In my State of South Australia, 45 per cent of young Australians who want jobs cannot get jobs. This Government wants to push through this legislation. It has done deals with the Democrats to enable it to put through pieces of legislation that will add further imposts on business and will further restrict the opportunity for young Australians to get work.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On each occasion in the four years that I have been in the Senate when a motion such as this has been moved, the same level of false indignation has been expressed. Senator Hill was the first person I have ever seen to make an angry speech with a smile on his face, because he knew that most of those opposite want this motion carried as much as we do and for exactly the same reason.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite all know that there are only three alternatives to this motion: firstly, that we sit for another week; secondly, that we sit late nights; and, thirdly, that we fail to pass the legislative program. Those three alternatives are all equally unacceptable. Let us look at the merit in this great posturing about why this matter has come up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill started to get excited and drew out a speech from some other occasion when it may or may not have been true that there had been all these gaps in the legislative program. A look at this session will show that there has not been any gaps, because we made the arrangement to have legislation in here at the start of the session, and it was here. The House of Representatives, whatever its many other faults may be, has passed legislation on schedule so that it can come in here. We have made appropriate arrangements to have legislation introduced in such a way that we have a flow of legislation all the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that we have spent some time talking about pecuniary interests. We are going to do so again on the first day of the next sittings, in response to a request from Senator Hill that we do so. </PARA>

There will not be matters lying around waiting to be dealt with. It is not a question of failing to deal with the Senate's business. That is the Senate's business. It is a matter that should be dealt with, and it will be dealt with on the first day of the next sittings. I do not in any way apologise for taking up a bit of time to deal with that. It is important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other suggestion is that in some way any delays and the extent to which the program might be behind schedule are the fault of the Government and that the Opposition has been cooperative. Some members of the Opposition have tried very hard to be cooperative and I have appreciated that. In particular, the work of the Opposition Whips in trying to facilitate the work has been appreciated. But let us get it clear: we have this new outbreak of what is called `taking note of answers disease'. It is catching. It is like a lot of other diseases: it generates a lot of heat in the patient but it does not generate much light to the community. All we get is the flush of outrage, a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of time taken to no good purpose whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Somebody has come up with this clever new tactic; we all have our theories about who, but it is not for me to say. It does take a lot of time. If the Opposition takes an hour and a half moving motions to take note of answers every day, we cannot be surprised if perhaps a bit less Government business is dealt with than would otherwise would have been the case. Alternatively, we get a situation such as we had with the industrial relations Bill of a list containing 20-plus speakers. We heard only about one-third of them. There was one speech seven times and 13 more people were listed to give it. This is hardly the mechanism that anybody would say was the basis of a cooperative arrangement to get the legislative program passed. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a much more generous guillotine motion than the Opposition ever introduced in all the time it was in government. It will get the Government business passed and allow a substantial amount of legislation to be debated and a substantial amount of debate on all the legislation. The minimum amount for any Bill is one hour, which is the most generous minimum there has ever been in such a motion. If it is to be criticised for anything, it might be that it is too generous. It will get the business done without our having to sit beyond midnight on any night unless we have some outrageous time wasting over and above that which we have already had. That is why we are moving the motion and that is why we do not support the suspension of Standing Orders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion we are debating at the moment is not about posturing; it is about the prostitution of the parliamentary process that Senator McMullan and his Government have been all about. It is absolutely appalling that yet again the Senate is being subjected to jackboot, brutal treatment of the proper processes of government and decision making in this country. It is absolutely appalling, first of all, that the Government sees the need for this action. It is perhaps even more appalling that the Democrats propose to support it. There is not one Democrat in the Senate chamber to defend their rotten record of support for the Government in the last couple of years and what they are doing again tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has absolutely botched its legislative process in the same way that it has botched the whole of its performance in policy making and proper processes in the last few years. It is not true&mdash;and Senator McMullan knows it&mdash;that the Opposition has not been cooperative with him. He paid tribute to the Whips and, through that, to the coalition for what we have done. We have played the game straight with the Government. We have not at any time frustrated its legislative program. When we started this sittings, the Government was scratching for things for the Senate to do. It did not have a legislative program in place so it could have a proper process of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several times during the period exactly the same thing has happened. Senator McMullan was away for the odd day or so, and on the odd day he was away there was virtually no legislative program at all. The honourable senator accused us of taking note of answers as a new gimmick, I think was the term he used. That process has elicited a lot more information than his Ministers were prepared to divulge through the normal Question Time process. It has enhanced the democratic process, not the reverse. In no way has that caused a delay in the Government's legislative program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, the reason for this guillotine is bad government, sloppy government, incompetent government and, above all, appalling mismanagement. The sooner those opposite get their act together in the dying months of this Government, the sooner we might get a little improvement in the efficiency of the operation of this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the Government's sloppiness, major Bills will be passed with little or no consideration&mdash;and not just by the Senate. Because of the Government's mismanagement, it also had to guillotine something like 40 Bills through the House of Representatives. These are major Bills dealing with the future of this country. They are dealing with the two million people that the Government has caused to be unemployed or underemployed; they are dealing with the whole tax structure of the country; and they are dealing with the gamut of industrial legislation and a whole raft of major matters affecting rural industry. No consideration will be given to those Bills because of this guillotine process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the most anti-democratic situation that one can have in a parliamentary system. There will be a cost to business and an impact on jobs as a result of the legislation which the Government will jack-boot through this place in the next few days. More than 60 Bills which are subject to the guillotine will be put through with virtually no consideration at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats sit here and try to tell us that they are the party that is going to `keep the bastards honest'. That is what the Democrats have said. But in the last two years and more we have seen the Democrats become simply political mouthpieces for this Government. They said that they wanted to see proper processes of government pursued. That was one of the reasons why they were here. They said they wanted to see the integrity of the Senate preserved. Instead, the Democrats have become partners in crime with the Government and they have frustrated the proper processes of government and the proper processes of this Parliament. The Liberal and National parties object totally to this jack-booted, arrogant, anti-democratic approach by the Government and its acolytes to the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the interjectors here as usual, but a lot have been cowed out of the debate this time. As I look around, I see that there are really only two left. Seven or eight Opposition senators used to come in here and say, `This Government is being anti-democratic when it decides to guillotine'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we go through the Senate Journals from 1975 to 1981 we find that the old recidivists&mdash;the guillotiners and the gaggers&mdash;are there, not Senator Harradine. Senator Harradine would remember that Senator Durack walked into this chamber many times and declared Bills urgent. He would also recall that he did not have the privilege of this debate because when the mob on the other side of the chamber moved a guillotine motion they would gag the motion so even that could not be debated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are slow learners over here; we still let the debate go for 2 1/2 hours. Senator Durack nods in assent because when he walked in, he would move the guillotine and then he would move the gag and with him was the hat-trick of pathetic Tasmanians&mdash;Senator Walters, Senator Watson and Senator Archer&mdash;who voted for every guillotine and gag that was put up by those opposite. So did Senator Teague, Senator MacGibbon and Senator Lewis. They all came in here and voted for the guillotine and the gag with great joy. Yet most of them now have the decency to absent themselves from the chamber and not interrupt my speech as they have when I have delivered exactly the same speech on two or three previous occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have Senator Short opening his mouth. Have a look at the record in the House of Representatives when he represented Ballarat for five years. Time and time again Senator Short voted for the gag and the guillotine. But he learnt a lot when he went out into the wilderness for three years. He has come back in here renewed as a real democrat and of course he is never going to vote to gag again. It is the same with the missing Senator Baume, who also voted consistently for gags and guillotines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If senators on the other side are serious; if their road to Damascus conversion is absolutely sincere, they should sign up now and say that in future years they will never vote for a guillotine. Come on, I want an indication from any one of them sitting there&mdash;from Senator Boswell, through to Senator Short, up to Senator Crane, around to Senator Campbell. I say to those opposite, `Put up your hands if you will never vote for a guillotine'. They will always reserve that right. We will probably come in here and fulminate against them if they are ever in government, if they have the absolute temerity ever to move a guillotine motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, deep down, those opposite want this motion to go through. Deep down, they love guillotines. It orders the debate; it makes their contribution concise; and they can all be home for seven weeks, out of the terrible winter that is afflicting us here. Not only is this good for those opposite, but also it is good group therapy because they get all their frustrations out and they get them out without bothering us on the adjournment debate or in other ways. So this is a wonderful debate for those opposite. They get what they want, which is a guillotine, an ordered debate, and they also cleanse their souls of all sorts of frustrations. But they will not do the final thing I ask them to do: will they give me an assurance that they will never vote for a guillotine motion as long as they live? No, they will not. They will not give me that guarantee, so the only word that describes the collective approach of the Opposition is hypocrisy. When those opposite are in government they vote for the guillotine and when they are in opposition they oppose it, and if they ever get into government again, they would support it. </PARA>

When those opposite were in government, they were very prepared to make sure they got their legislation through using exactly the same methods that the Government wishes to use now. They believe that, following the next election, they will be in government again. Mark my words, the Australian Democrats will still be in this chamber holding the balance of power and those opposite will be relying upon us to help them get their legislation at least debated, and that is the point at issue here. We take the position that the Government at least has the responsibility and the right to have its legislation debated&mdash;not necessarily passed, but at least brought up and debated. That is what we are ensuring by supporting this motion here tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it should be obvious to everybody who walks even in a most cursory fashion through this chamber that the so-called second reading debates are not debates at all. In the case of the so-called resource security legislation we saw 17 Opposition speakers going over and over exactly the same material&mdash;already having made up their mind exactly what they were going to do&mdash;and completely wasting time in this chamber. The effective debates that go on in this chamber are those in the committee stage, and they are a much smaller part of the debating of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe, as I have said, that the Government has a right at least to have its legislation debated. We are giving no guarantee that we will pass any of this legislation, but at least the Government has a right to have it debated. I remind the ladies and gentlemen of the Opposition when it becomes their turn&mdash;and we will still be here on these benches&mdash;that they will be relying upon us at exactly the same time in each session to get their legislation at least debated. I say the same thing to them: we will give no guarantee that their legislation will necessarily be passed. But at least we will give an undertaking that they will have a right to get their legislation brought into this place and have it debated.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have never supported, and do not intend ever to support, the guillotine. The situation that we are faced with in this chamber is virtually a denial of the rights of individual senators to exercise their primary function. That primary function is the expressive function; that is, to express the views of constituents on the legislation that is before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to only three or four of the Bills that are before us&mdash;I think there are 57&mdash;that are now subject to the guillotine. We have a mere three hours to debate the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill and a mere three hours on the Broadcasting Services Bill and the Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill. The broadcasting legislation is to set in place provisions relating to free-to-air television and other broadcasting categories, including pay TV. It will set them into concrete. Frankly, what that legislation does is to give legislatively to the industry a power which is not warranted. It is industry friendly and is the enemy of the consumers. I will, of course, be going into that. What it will do, of course&mdash;and I want people who are on the Government side to listen to this&mdash;is remove ultimately the provisions applicable to free-to-air television relating to content which is blasphemous, indecent or obscene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has given only three hours for that particular debate. The legislation goes into ownership and all other mechanisms. This debating time is an absolute disgrace. We are talking about freedom of speech. We are talking about giving the right to certain people in the television and radio industries to make money. The Government has given to the industry the right to prepare codes of conduct which involve program standards and complaints procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a great backlash against any Government member, or indeed any member, who might vote against proposed amendments that I intend to move to this particular Bill to protect the public interest. Government members may not have time to debate them, but that is their fault. If they vote against them, they will be blamed by every TV viewer who is offended by certain material that comes across broadcast television. I certainly will be pointing the finger of shame and blame at them for not supporting them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice that Senator Robert Ray is leaving the chamber before he even hears the debate. What a preconceived arrogance! The matter is not even open to debate. Having repeated the same speech he has given on half a dozen occasions, he pompously marches out of the chamber without being prepared to debate the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite outrageous for Senator Robert Ray to suggest that in some obscure, perverted way the Opposition gets some satisfaction out of this motion. Absolutely nothing is further from the truth.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We had none at the beginning, and I will come to that in a minute. We are prepared to stay as long as is necessary to ventilate our views, participate in meaningful debate and expose the legislation for what it is. Of course, the Government wants to pack its bags and run. It is terrified that there may be some public scrutiny, public examination or public criticism of its legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not want the Government's program; we do not want the Government's legislation; and we do not want its Bills. We are prepared to stay here as long as is necessary to make that point clear. Senator Patterson interjected a moment ago to observe that at the beginning of this session there was no legislation. There was an absolute vacuum. This Government could not run a chook raffle. For days we had to filibuster and invent debate so as to ensure that the Senate could continue to function in some way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the Government, we do respect the forms of the Senate and the Parliament and we are prepared to go through the proper processes to ensure that legislation is introduced and read a first time, debated and read a second time, the clauses are debated and then, if necessary, a debate on the third reading. It has not dawned on the Government that this is a House of second consideration and second contemplation. This is the chamber where, in the event the Government makes mistakes, whether deliberate or in drafting, mistakes are corrected. This is the chamber where amendments can be effected and where legislation can be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How often have we seen legislation introduced into this chamber from the House of Representatives to find it is deficient, defective or wrong and the Government is obliged to amend its own legislation? We now have something like 39 hours in which to debate 69 pieces of legislation. This is legislation of great moment. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Patterson" NAMEID="LI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator Patterson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They'll all come back to be amended.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. In due course, as Senator Patterson quite sensibly interjects, most of this legislation will come back to us to be corrected and have the defects amended accordingly. The legislation before us is not without significance. They are major pieces of legislation affecting the daily lives of most Australians. Of course, with the Government's cavalier disregard for the rights of the Opposition, for the forms of the Parliament and for proper processes and proper debate, this legislation will be rushed through the chamber without an opportunity for it to be scrutinised and examined. For instance, the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 fundamentally changes the common law premise upon which our legislation thus far has stood. We now have legislation where contractual relationships between two private parties can be interfered with, changed or cancelled at the whim or the wish of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. We have legislation before us now which will ensure that the cost of the ordinary private home to the ordinary average Australian will go up by $20,000 per unit simply to satisfy and placate Senator Peter Cook's old mates in the Builders Workers Industrial Union. We have legislation before us which will choke off the modest beginnings and the spluttering start of some stimulation in the housing sector. Because of the bloody-minded determination of this Government to bend and bow to the wishes of its trade union master, that growth will be choked off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation in Australia where about 85 per cent of workers are employed under industrial relations agreements, yet only 42 per cent are members of unions. That demonstrates that the average worker does not want to be in a union, does not want to be intimidated and does not want to be party to a union. Yet we have legislation before us which will coerce and cause people to be signed up to join unions irrespective of their wishes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have all sorts of other legislation before us to debate. We have the wool Bills. As I remember, the wool Bills are amending the original legislation which imposed a 15 per cent levy on the woolgrowers of Australia. We managed to reduce it to 12 per cent. Now it will be reduced to a much more reasonable level&mdash;our original level. In a very vain, crude, artificial way the Government proposed that there be a refund, a tax cheque, in hand. That legislation will not be debated in a proper way. It is subject to a one-hour debate. There are five pieces of amending legislation which we will have one hour to debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Customs Legislation (Tariff Concessions and Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill is to be debated. In that legislation the Government is looking for political efficiency, not economic efficiency; the Government is bowing to short term political pressure which will impose an added tariff on this country at the cost of the rest of the taxpayers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is right&mdash;for short term political gain, for long term economic loss! We also have to debate the Sales Tax Assessment Bill and five associated pieces of legislation&mdash;a vain attempt to restructure the ramshackled wholesale sales tax legislation. It would have been an ideal opportunity to have debated the goods and services tax and to explain to the Australian people why Paul Keating's 1983 proposal to introduce a goods and services tax was found to be wanting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have to debate the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992 and four pieces of complementary legislation. This legislation will impose an added cost, an added burden, on the employers of Australia, significantly reduce employment and, naturally, increase unemployment. It is simply an addition to payroll tax. We also have to debate the Taxation Laws Amendment Bills and the Coal Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill. All this legislation is vital to Australia, yet members of the Government are prepared to guillotine the legislation through for no good reason other than that, at the end of this fortnight, they want to get up and go home. They are not prepared to involve themselves in a proper debate simply because they are not prepared to allow the public to have the opportunity to scrutinise their legislation. I know it is a vain hope, but I hope the motion before us is defeated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nice try, Senator Macdonald. Anyone in this chamber who has had any experience in politics would realise that running Parliament in the way it should be run is a question of balance. It is a question of trying to work out how governments can be made accountable; how to get debates on major issues that may not be on the legislative agenda put before the Senate and before the Australian people; making sure that sufficient legislation gets through this Parliament to enable the Government to run smoothly; and ensuring that it is debated appropriately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That balance is something that every government has to try to work out. The Government cannot simply force its way through this chamber, where it does not have the numbers, where it has to negotiate and where it has to talk with either of the other two major parties. It will not have its way all the time. Everyone knows that we have to talk to the Democrats, the Liberal Party and members of the National Party, when the Liberals let them off the leash, if we want to ensure that we get the passage of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that ultimately in this place there must be some form of compromise in order to make this Parliament work. The Government cannot enforce its will willy-nilly on this chamber. We all know that. Let us not pretend that for some reason or other tonight the Government has said, in a capricious and arbitrary manner, `We are going to impose this time schedule on you'. The Opposition knows that the Democrats, who have had a fairly consistent policy about the use of guillotines, have come to the end of their tether. They know that there is significant legislation that must be considered. They know that without the use of the guillotine on occasions, the Opposition will take every advantage to fill in all the available time so that proper review of legislation is not possible in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It always amazes me that oppositions in some States and in some Federal parliaments, particularly this Opposition, see some disadvantage in discussing and debating government legislation. I would have thought that if philosophically and practically the Opposition wanted to examine legislation in a thorough, detailed and rational way, it would have ensured that at least half of those elements of parliamentary trickery that it has been practising in the last few months were not practised and that it left most of the time for Government legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has Question Time every day to make its views known and to get information out of the Government. It has a number of parliamentary techniques which allow it to discuss issues that it wants to discuss and to make the Government accountable in that ad hoc way that those particular parliamentary techniques allow it to do. Yet what has it done? It has lacked self-discipline. Members of the Liberal Party and the National Party cannot talk to each other, but they are in coalition. The Nationals and the Liberals hardly talk to each other when it gets down to big issues. For example, did they talk to each other over tariffs on sugar? They cannot tell me that they did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should look at the times that the Opposition tried to get a rational view about debates in this chamber. It knows what goes on in its party rooms. Those opposite who want to have a rational arrangement of the legislative program of the whole processes in this chamber&mdash;those who believe in that&mdash;have been rolled simply by the pig-headed ones in their party that they have no control over. They are always the same people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walters always voted for the guillotine when she was in government. She never once crossed the floor on a guillotine motion. Every time Senator Durack and others walked in and said, `We move the gag now', she voted with it. Her high principles went out the window. When she was not voting for the guillotine when she was in this chamber in government, in opposition she used every trick in the book to ensure that rational, reasonable debate did not occur in this chamber. Talk about democracy!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who is the loudest interjector in this place? Who always interjects on every speech? Who cannot stop herself calling out? Who, when she has problems not understanding what other people are saying or when she disagrees with them, calls quorums on any member of the Government trying to make a few points? The more effective they are in the points they make, the more likely Senator Walters is to call a quorum on them. I remember many occasions when Senator Walters would call a quorum and then walk out of the chamber, having disrupted the flow of someone's speech and the debate in the chamber. On many occasions Senator Walters and, I might say, Senator Newman have called two quorums during a 10-minute speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can those opposite come into this House and talk about their concern for democratic procedures when they, on many occasions, have abused those procedures, not only when they were in opposition&mdash;and they have been there for nine years or so&mdash;but also when they were in government? I really cannot believe that Senator Walters could sit in this debate hoohing and howling about how anti-democratic this Government is because it wants to get on with some quick debate about some major legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What legislation are we looking at? Let us have a look at it. First of all, there is the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill, which refers in particular to independent contractors. That is a very important part of that Bill.

I am not hurt by it, and I accept your protection. But, at the same time, I understand that the same old patterns of behaviour are occurring again&mdash;those who shout interjections and then walk out of the chamber. Those sorts of things are happening even before my very eyes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt, when we look at the legislation that this Government is putting through now and that we want to discuss tonight, that there are some major issues contained in that legislation. I want the debate; I want the opportunity, for example, to debate with Senator Crane and Senator Calvert these issues relating to independent contractors. Those issues have been around since 1985 when the Hancock inquiry brought forward its views about what should happen to the industrial relations system in Australia. I look forward to that debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many things have occurred in this chamber to prevent us from getting to that particular issue. We have already examined that issue in our Committee. It has been referred back to the chamber. I am saying tonight: let us get on with it. Those opposite have strong views about it. Their views contrast markedly with ours. There is no doubt that that debate should be heard. It should not be put off until the late hours of this evening or early into the next morning, continuing the stupid sitting patterns that we have been following in terms of the hours that we have had to sit in this chamber. It should be heard, for example, when members of the press are around, so that they, and through them the people of Australia, are aware that there are major differences between the major political parties on this issue of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, this forum is the only one that we have. Rather than, for example, saying, `Let's fill in our time with stupid motions that are coming across to make the Government look silly' and wasting time on that sort of thing, why not do the alternative thing, which is to look at Government legislation so that, through an analysis, study and debate about that legislation, those opposite can get their points across? It is a more effective way for an opposition to work than the way those opposite have been working in the last few months. The way they have been working in the last few months has been simply to waste time and to delay legislation when, in fact, they should be in here having the courage to debate that legislation. Those opposite do not seem to have the courage. They run away using all these other techniques in the Parliament to waste time. They should come to us now and debate with us. We are very glad to debate our Bills with them. I am sure, if they really allowed themselves, they would enjoy the debate as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has just come up from the House of Representatives? Are we holding up the House of Representatives? I think Senator McKiernan is more stupid than he looks if he reckons that. That is the point. This evening Senator McMullan told us in shock-horror that we are at it again. He is the Manager of Government Business&mdash;or `Mismanager' of Government Business. We started here after the summer break on 25 February and sat for two weeks and then we had two weeks off; we then had two weeks on and three weeks off; we then had two weeks on and two weeks off; and then we had two weeks on and one week off. We are now at the beginning of a two-week sitting period. The point is that we lost three weeks in one lot and two weeks in another when the Government was out trying to sell the One Nation package and getting nowhere with it. That is where the time was lost. Senator Aulich has the hide to stand up&mdash;supported by Senator McKiernan&mdash;and say that the Opposition is delaying legislation. The legislation went through the House of Representatives sausage machine two weeks ago. How could we have delayed it? This is our first week back. Senator Aulich cannot say that we have delayed this package of Bills. The Government needs a lesson on how not to run out of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been spoken to about taking note of answers at the end of Question Time. If Ministers told the truth in their answers and did not misrepresent what is in the Hewson Fightback package, there would be no need for us to get up and put the record straight that there will not be 15 per cent added on to everything that is sold in Australia. Time and time again, in answer to a backbencher's question, a dorothy dixer, Ministers finish by saying that it will cost 15 per cent more. The Opposition has to take note of those answers.

If Senator Evans had come clean and said, `Yes, I did make a mistake, I apologise; let's get on with it', it would have taken the wind out of our sails and we would have got on with legislation&mdash;the legislation that was not here, incidentally. That is the situation. Hours and hours went into extracting the truth. It was like pulling teeth out. That is where the time was wasted. Let it not be said that the Opposition wasted time. In the early days of these sittings the legislation was not forthcoming. We sat for two weeks after Christmas and then had two off; we then had two weeks on and three weeks off while the Government was off on its wild-goose chase of trying to sell its One Nation package. That is the situation. The Government and the Manager of Government Business are blaming us for things that we did not do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the Democrats&mdash;the pure whites. Senator Kernot was described on television tonight as playing hard to get. I have known those who have played hard to get, but I will not go into that right now. The Democrats are supporting the guillotine on the superannuation levy Bill&mdash;one of the most important and costly Bills to ever come before this Parliament. It will send umpteen employers out of business. How much time has the Government allocated for that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have played hard to get for about the last week or two and tonight they have folded up. They reckon they have a victory, saying that it is only 4 per cent with the rest coming in later. To me, all that represents is a stay of execution. If one is to be executed and is aware of that fact, one may as well get it over and done with&mdash;although I would never want to be in that position. We will let those employers linger on for probably another 12 months and then we will send them down the tube. So the Democrats, with Senator Kernot playing the lead role, have now agreed with the Government to sell 100,000 jobs down the drain soon after this legislation goes through. That is how the Democrats see keeping people honest in this place&mdash;and that is how they have always done it. </PARA>

If the Opposition cannot organise their own speakers so that Senator Macdonald could get the call with its agreement, that is its problem. Therefore, I called Senator Panizza; I do not resile from that.

This Government in its dying days is proof positive of that. It simply cannot manage the legislative program before it. It has no idea of how it would get these Bills through if it were serious in any way about trying to get them through. It chooses to fiddle around for the rest of the sittings, leaving very little business before the Parliament, and to leave it right to the last minute to bring in this very important legislation, much of which has a lot of influence and many positive effects for its mates, the people it has always supported while it has been in government&mdash;the unions, the ACTU, the big businessmen, the big newspapers and the media people. They are the sort of people who will benefit from this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will not be properly scrutinised because of the way the Government has deliberately mismanaged its business in this chamber to curtail the proper review of this legislation by us.

The Government will stop at nothing and stoop to no end to stop us properly discussing this legislation. </PARA>

I have to say that I am very glad that I stood aside to enable Senator Macdonald to speak first. What an extraordinary 10-minute speech it was. Senator Macdonald made more sexist remarks in a period of about 90 seconds than the rest of us could make in a hundred years. He went from prostitutes to ladies of the night. I do not know whether Senator Macdonald has had any particular experience in that area, but it is really insulting to the rest of the Parliament to use those sorts of phrases.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But does anyone on the other side want to change the voting system back to that which applied before 1949 when the major party which won the most seats in the House of Representatives usually won something like 33 seats out of 36 in the Senate so there were big changeovers of senators at each election? Would those opposite want to go back to that system? If they do, it would certainly get rid of the Democrats. It would certainly guarantee that if the Opposition had a big win at the next Federal election it would have something like 60 out of 76 senators in this place to carry whatever it likes with any number of guillotines it likes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is rank hypocrisy for Senator Macdonald to stand up and say that the Democrats, with 4 per cent of the vote, do not deserve to be represented when his Party, for 40 years, has supported the PR system that guarantees that small parties with 4 or 5 per cent of the vote have representation in here. While that system lasts, as long as Senator Macdonald lives and way beyond that, a minority party&mdash;whether it be the Democrats or whatever&mdash;will hold the balance of power in this chamber. Senator Macdonald will have to get used to it. The only way around that is if the two major parties agree to change the system and we go to some other form of list which means there is a cut-off point so the minorities cannot have the balance of power. But Senator Macdonald's Party is not interested in that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe Senator Macdonald has some sort of standing in and influence on the Queensland Liberal Party. It is hard for me to understand, from his performance here, why he would have, but he must have some support if he got Liberal Party preselection in Queensland. I bet that at the next Senate election, the Queensland Liberal Party will give all its preferences to the Democrats before it gives them to the Labor Party. Obviously, it will give its preferences to the National Party before it gives them to the Democrats. It will give every one of its preferences on the registered how-to-vote card to the Democrats before it will give them to the Labor Party to ensure that the Democrats sit here with the balance of power after the next election, whether the Opposition wins or whether we win. </PARA>

For him to stand up and claim ethics about how this is a use of numbers to crunch through a guillotine motion to enable all the Bills to be dealt in the next two weeks really is just rank hypocrisy. As I have said, I respect him as a numbers cruncher. He leads the mad right wing of the Liberal Party in Western Australia, spearing all the small `l' liberals, the red Freds of the Party, through the heart. He does it very well; I respect him for it.

When a debate such as this is on, those opposite round up the usual suspects: the rump, the people who cannot make it any other way&mdash;Shirley Walters, John Panizza, Peter Macdonald and Senator Kemp. Where is Senator Bronwyn Bishop tonight? The Opposition has sent her off on a junket overseas, I suppose. Or is she occupied in stacking a branch of the Liberal Party in New South Wales?

When we add to that the 62 Bills which are being guillotined tonight, we find that some 220 Bills will have been guillotined through the Parliament.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Industrial Relations Legislation Bill 1992</EMPHASIS> are yet another example of the influence of the unions and the ACTU over the Federal Government. Or to put it another way, they display what little input the Federal Labour Government has in the formulation of its own policies.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have before us a set of legislative amendments which seek to entrench union "participation" or what I would call interference in two vital areas of industrial relations: namely-</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a) in respect of independent contracts; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">b) in the area of certified agreements.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have a set of amendments that give the AIRC an unfettered power to review contracts for services, including those contracts of independent contractors. This may be at the behest of a party to the contract itself or at the request of a union, even where that contractor is not a member of the union in question.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have a further set of amendments which claim to facilitate and further extend enterprise agreements and extend their use&mdash;but in reality they increase the role of interfering unions and much to the chagrin of industry, they will impede agreements being struck and presented to the AIRC for certification.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">And why is Senator Cook seeking these amendments? Not at the behest of industry and employer organisations. Not even at the request of independent contractors. But because of Cook's relationship and the relationship of the Federal Government, with the ACTU.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We can see a direct relationship between the introduction of these amendments and the failure of the BWIU in the Troubleshooters decision to obtain AIRC constitutional coverage of independent contractors in the commercial/industrial building sector. Having failed to achieve such coverage via the High Court, the BWIU and the ACTU have sought to lean on the Federal Government to achieve union dominance in the workplace via legislative means. The unions are petrified that the High Court decision will further reduce their control of the workplace and they have decided to take action. That is originally why the amendments were drafted. That is why we are here. Not because of some policy initiative of the Federal Government.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has now withdrawn the specific provision giving the AIRC jurisdiction over industrial disputes involving independent contractors. However, we can still see the union motivation for the amendments. We are also left with an impossible situation where the AIRC has jurisdiction over contracts relating to independent contractors (not only in the commercial/industrial sector but also in relation to the residential building sector and indeed in respect of all contract labour). The amendments further provide for unions to have plenary power in enlisting contractors, in demanding reviews of contracts and in even having the final say in whether a certified agreement will be struck.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let us make no mistake, this Bill in both its original and its present form, is all about union control and union dominance. It bears no relation to a law for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth. It has nothing to do with what is in the best interests of the Australian people. It is a naked, cloying gambit by a dying Federal Government in the clutches of the ACTU, to salvage flagging union memberships. It is an attempt to drive large, highly efficient non-unionised sectors of the workforce into the claws of unions. Having failed to do this in the courts, the pendulum has now swung to Federal Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">And why? Because union memberships are declining and unions are losing their grip on their power base; they are losing their blackmailing power. In an era where 85% of workers work under awards and only 42% of those workers belong to a union, that means 43% of workers do not voluntarily belong to a union but they are still controlled by the unionised wages policy of the ACTU. By entwining independent contractors into the web of union power and union dominance, the proposed legislation is exposing what has been to date, a largely untapped source of union power.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However in extending this power base of unions, the Federal Government has shown no regard for individual rights and freedoms. The rights of the collective have precedence over the rights of the individual under this regime.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see that the amendments allow the AIRC to review contracts of independent contractors to determine whether they are unfair, harsh or against the public interest. Further, the AIRC has the right to vary, amend or set aside those contracts altogether. In this way a party may be hauled into the AIRC by a union or a disaffected contractor to justify the contract and to explain that it will not threaten the integrity of the existing award system which the unions are seeking to extend to contractors. This is simply outrageous.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet, what is even more insidious, is the Government's flagrant disregard for individual freedoms. The amendments are an assault on the Common Law freedom of contract&mdash;a right which allows an individual to dictate when, how and on what basis he will provide his services. This is a right which has been enshrined in our Common Law for over 200 years. In one fell swoop, the Government is prepared to abrogate that right and seriously erode the right of Australians to enter into normal commercial arrangements. It shows the Government's unbridled, undemocratic contempt for a right which has developed by our courts with measured thought for the benefit of all individuals.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">And while the amendments show contempt for our laws and our democratic rights, they show reverence for the role and the rights of unions&mdash;to the detriment of our economy.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see "union control" stamped all over the provisions of this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see the deletion of provisions from the original Bill, prohibiting the AIRC giving preference to any parties, which effectively allows the AIRC to grant preference to employees over independent contractors or vice versa.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see that unions will have standing to seek a review of a contract of an independent contractor, even where the contractor has yet to become a member of the organisation of employees.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see that a review of a contract on the ground that it is against the public interest may include a comparison to award conditions, thereby enforcing award conditions to independent contractors at the request of unions.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see that union coverage is extended to independent contractors, affording unions the power in non-union areas regardless of the wishes of an individual. In short, union power will be foisted onto independent contractors who have to date been just that: independent.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see that a right of appeal exists to the Full Bench of the AIRC concerning orders made in relation to contracts where an organisation or person is aggrieved by the decision or act concerned or bound by the award or order made.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">And what is the cost of this union dominance for the Australian community? It is a considerable cost. Not only will we lose our democratic freedom to contract with whomever and on whatever basis we choose, but we will see considerable financial loss to the Australian people as a result of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many highly efficient and productive businesses, (especially in the home building industry), that rely heavily on independent contractors for labour, will see unions enrolling independent contractors, forcing them in to the AIRC where their contracts will be amended and the costs of labour will increase. The housing industry alone has claimed that the price of the average Australian home being built will increase by between a staggering $10,000 to $25,000. This is a result of an increase in labour costs of almost 40%.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the amendments, industries that rely heavily on independent contractors, such as the transport industry and particularly the residential building industry, will be at the mercy of unions in much the same way as the commercial building industry has fallen victim to abuse. Over the last 30 years the commercial building industry has been subject to union thuggery, sweetheart deals, cost over-runs and missed deadlines. Moreover, the unions have stymied all attempts by employers to achieve more competitive and cost efficient operations. This is what waits in store for independent contractors under this proposed legislation.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Cook has claimed that the independent contractor amendments will only reach "sham contacts" that have been designed to avoid the proper reach of individual awards. This is arrant nonsense. These amendments will extend to all contracts involving independent contractors.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In an economic climate that would benefit from less regulation and more flexibility, the independent contractor amendments are a disaster for Australia and will thrust yet another group of Australian workers into the clutches of unions and under the rigid control and regulation of a centralised award system.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The independent contractor amendments smack of compulsory unionism and a denial of free bargaining. They are an affront to individual liberty and must be rejected.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This same stench of union control permeates the amendments in the Bill relating to certified agreements.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see the Government provisions with noble objects of facilitating the making of enterprise agreements and encouraging their use in the prevention and settlement of disputes. This is quite commendable. However, amongst all that nobility and good intent, are the unions. These are industrial organisations whose leaders have polled 3rd last in a recent survey of the occupations which most Australians regard as the most ethical and honest.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">And where do the unions feature in the certified agreement provisions? Well I think the question is where do they not appear?!</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see that in order for the AIRC to make a certified agreement, the parties must be in dispute, and lo and behold, one of those parties could include a union.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see that the requirement for unions to consult members only when negotiating an agreement, excludes non-union members from the consultative process. This means that employees who are not members of a trade union will have no say in the terms and conditions of agreements which will govern their employment. This is a disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see that in the case of a single business enterprise agreement, it is a requirement that all possible union parties are included in negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see once again that in the case of a single business enterprise, the requirement to name a union party when that enterprise is not covered by an award, is a clear barrier to enterprise agreements for non-unionised employers and will preclude from enterprise agreements most professional enterprises because the employer must negotiate with a union organisation that is capable of covering non-unionised employees.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see that the AIRC must not certify an agreement where it disadvantages employees and further that an agreement is deemed to disadvantage employees if it reduces award entitlements. What will transpire from this you ask? Well certified agreements will end up being a duplication of awards. This will play into the hands of unions that want to impede any review of restrictive award provisions.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Again, we see that under the appeal provisions in the Bill, unions will have the right to lodge appeals against an AIRC decision to certify an enterprise agreement, thus holding-up the implementation of an agreement that is not to its fancy.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">What do all these legislative amendments suggest? Union control and union dominance.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">And apart from preventing the extension of the use of certified agreements because of union "participation", the amendments represent an unwarranted and repugnant Government interference into aspects of labour relations where governments do not belong.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see provisions allowing the making of agreements settling two or more disputes that could facilitate the making of common agreements across a whole industry. This is destructive as it may foster common settlements at a time when our national interests call for diversity, and it is exactly what the ACTU desire.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see vague and ill-defined terms such as "contrary to the public interest" that by definition, cannot include a consideration of the objects of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">IR Act 1988</EMPHASIS> and what the state of the economy might be. This makes a complete nonsense of the term.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see a dangerous and intrusive right given to the Minister to intervene on the vague basis that the agreement relating to a single enterprise, if certified, would "seriously jeopardise the public interest". What that means, is again a mystery. However, there is no doubt that this unwarranted right of the Government to intervene, extends not only to a single enterprise where it happens to be the Government, but also extends to the private sector which is perfectly capable of determining what is in its own best interests.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see other repugnant aspects of the amendments that allow lapsed agreements to become awards, capable of being varied and built upon once in force. In this way, we have a set of amending provisions that frustrate the whole alleged purpose of a large component of the Bill. The whole point of enterprise agreements is that they are flexible enough to respond to the economy to ensure maximum efficiency and productivity in an industry at a particular time. This will not be possible where certified agreements simply become awards automatically.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand the situation, I am to reply to the speeches made by honourable senators opposite in the second reading debate. If I might exercise that right and deal with the amendment at the same time, it might help us get quickly to the committee stage of this Bill and aid the efficiency of the Senate and the opportunity of those opposite to deal with the matters in the committee stage. If I am right about that, perhaps I should proceed in that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By any test, this is quite significant legislation. It involves five major changes to various pieces of industrial legislation. The first and most significant change is to section 115 of the Federal Industrial Relations Act. The second&mdash;and the one which has drawn the most public attention&mdash;is the change introducing a role for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in dealing with harsh and unreasonable contracts for independent contractors. The third change is a social justice measure to enable people to pursue wage claims to which they are entitled but for which the cost of pursuing them at law would be too high. It provides a small claims tribunal mechanism so that they can in fact obtain their rights easily and with the minimum of legal problems. The fourth and fifth changes are changes respectively to the duties of the Vice-President of the Industrial Relations Commission and the representation on the NLCC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill took a long time in its gestation. It started life as a gleam in the eye of the Hancock report which was delivered to Parliament in 1985. In 1990, upon being given the authority as Minister for Industrial Relations, I advised the parties that we would review the Hancock legislation put down in 1987 and go through all of the provisions of that report and the existing Industrial Relations Act. As a consequence of that, at the NLCC level&mdash;the proper recognised forum for tripartite consultations between unions, employers and government in this country&mdash;we started on a long process of discussions about most of the elements in this Bill, and certainly about all of the elements of the controversial section relating to independent contractors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the introduction of this Bill, I have had some 52 separate meetings with various employer organisations on the matter of subcontractors. In the end, there was no agreement. That puts the Government in a position of having to make a decision and, having exhausted every reasonable avenue for possible compromise, we did so. We have made a decision and the result is the Bill before the Parliament. In putting forward this Bill to the Parliament I believed it was necessary for the Government to put the Bill down as quickly as possible, because the Government was being abused and misrepresented quite dishonestly by some&mdash;although not all&mdash;of the parties which had been consulted by us in the process of the evolution of this Bill. So it was important in the public interest to have the real legislation we were proposing&mdash;not legislation which was argued by some of the parties to be what we intended&mdash;put down in our name as soon as possible so that we could demonstrate by declaring our hand the lie that was being perpetrated about our intent by some of the parties with whom we had consulted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of our putting the Bill down, further discussions have ensued and we are now proposing a series of amendments to reflect the outcome of those further discussions. It is fair to say that we do not have 100 per cent approval from either of the major social partners; certainly not from the ACTU and certainly not from the employers. What we have been able to do with the Bill as it now comes before this chamber, and with the amendments that I propose to make, is to have an outcome which, while not reflecting a perfect solution from either side, captures the vast bulk of the middle ground and is, in the exercise of responsible government, an outcome that is reasonable by any test and one which privately, if somewhat grudgingly, would be conceded as an appropriate one by most of the major protagonists here. That is not to say that everyone can fit the description of being reasonable, because&mdash;and I will deal with this in a minute&mdash;there is disgraceful, dishonourable and disreputable behaviour by two organisations, the Housing Industry Association and the Australian Small Business Association. I will deal with them in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now turn to the significant features of the debate in the second reading and do so with some amazement at the content of some of the second reading contributions. In the notices of motion session earlier today a couple of honourable senators gave notice of motions referring to the levels of unemployment and mentioned a number of things as possible causes of future unemployment, including this industrial relations legislation. They included that as an item which might create further unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can say is that that reflects a situation of supreme ignorance on behalf of those proposers which, I might add, was also reflected in some other speeches at the second reading stage. So those senators are not alone. It could also reflect a situation in which they know only too well the economic significance of the changes to section 115 of this Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the independent contractors' section has been the section that has attracted most public controversy, there is no doubt that any fair-minded, independent commentator would say that the changes to section 115 are the most profoundly important changes to industrial relations law in this country for almost a century; they are changes which introduce a new era of workplace or enterprise bargaining; and they are changes in which the social partners in the workplace will be encouraged to develop a new workplace culture for Australia, a culture that is cooperative in nature and not conflict-prone, dispute-ridden and representative of the old class, caste, occupational, trade or craft connotations that have bedevilled this society and that of British speaking and British inheriting societies in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The section 115 changes are sweeping and profoundly significant in terms of industrial relations law reform and are profoundly significant in economic terms, too. The common ground between the major political parties in this country is a need to decentralise industrial relations more to the enterprise or workplace level. While that need is a commonly supported objective by employers and unions&mdash;and, in October, by the national wage case bench of the industrial relations system&mdash;the major political parties differ about the way in which that objective should be introduced. We have a view of an objective, but a difference about the means of implementing it. This Bill introduces the objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought in the healthy forum of parliamentary debate, with industrial relations designated as the cornerstone of the Fightback package by the Opposition, the one thing that upholds its whole philosophy, it would have seized upon the opportunity to debate section 115 and proposed an alternative means to the one that the Government has proposed to introduce workplace or enterprise bargaining. Did those opposite do that? The answer is no, they did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the speeches of Opposition members at the second reading stage, it appears that they are in the peculiar situation of not commenting to any extent at all on enterprise bargaining, refusing the obvious offer by the Government to engage in the clash of ideas that makes democracy in this country work, refusing to trot out an alternative proposal as to how workplace bargaining should be introduced. The fact that those opposite declined to even debate section 115 in any significant way is a telling condemnation of the efficacy of their own ideas or the paucity with which they have given thought to industrial relations policy development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this Bill reaches the House of Representatives, I challenge the Opposition spokesperson on industrial relations, John Howard, to make a comprehensive statement on the Opposition's industrial relations policy, to explain to the electorate of Australia the details of the centrepiece of the Fightback program, and to answer a number of significant questions which are blowing in the wind&mdash;questions to which constituents of the Australian electorate want answers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How will the Opposition's policy work? What specifically will be the protections and preventions for ordinary people? How will the Opposition's policy prevent workers from being forced out of the protection of the award stream by an employer who wants to put an employee on a contract? How will scrupulous employers compete with the unfair advantage that is offered by the Hewson unscrupulous employers? With no more national wage cases, how will workers in weak bargaining positions ever get a wage rise? If industrial disputes are to be dealt with under the common law instead of by the Industrial Relations Commission, how will ordinary workers have the time and the resources to take their employers to court? How long will it take the courts to hear the cases? How will the Opposition's model of industrial relations protect living standards? How will it make everybody a winner?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward in anticipation, but not in much expectation, to the Opposition at least having the decency to declare its position on this important and significant economic reform. To the proposers of the notices of motion I say this: if the notices of motion are ever declared formal, please do not raise this issue. We are now presiding over a massive economic change which will produce a productivity surge through the economy as more and more workplaces under our style of workplace enterprise bargaining introduce the concept and develop a cooperative teamwork ethic in place of the confrontationist one that so typifies the Opposition's industrial relations policy. With the successful passage of this section of the legislation tonight, we are about to see a boost to the Australian economy, which is bad news to the Opposition but good news to Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most controversial section of these amendments relates to the independent contractors. Had it been possible to have described them as `sham contractors' or `quasi employees' and hold significant legal meaning by the use of those terms, I would have preferred that. The term `independent contractors' has been exploited to make it appear that things which were never intended and which were explicitly denied by the Government may be intended. Last night and tonight it has been the subject of a despicable, dishonest and untrue campaign by two employer organisations for which they must be condemned, not only by the Government but also by other employer organisations which have had the decency and honesty to recognise a fair outcome when they see one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the beginning, the question of independent contractors was shamefully misrepresented. As a consequence, we agreed that this matter should go to a parliamentary inquiry in order that the arguments could be teased out. They were, to some extent, yesterday. The fact that they were found hollow and empty is in itself the reason why the Senate should not support the motion moved by Senator Brownhill at the beginning of the debate tonight. That motion is fatuous in the extreme and one which would deny the effectiveness of the inquiry held by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The independent contractors section is not a means by which an award can be obtained. It is not a means by which independent contractors will be forced to join trade unions. Those things were said in the second reading speech. They appear not to have had any weight or significance placed in them. This provision, in a more tightly and narrowly drawn sense, simply reflects legislation that applies in New South Wales, introduced by the Greiner Government last year, at a Federal level. The most damning condemnation of the critics is that, when the Greiner Government did it, they raised no objections but, when a Keating Labor Government did it, they funded disreputable and lying television campaigns to oppose it. That explains their motive, their intent and their purpose. Those employer organisations do not represent the interests of their members; they are simply political adjuncts to the Opposition and are acting politically against the interests of their members and against the interests of other well-conducted employer organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a bit surprised to see a media comment on public radio today in which Dr Ron Silberberg of the Housing Industry Association was asked by the interviewer whether his media campaign was an appropriate one, given that the National Employers Forum had reached an undertaking with me and that his organisation was a member of the National Employers Forum and took part in those negotiations, in which I, in good faith, reached an agreement with employers. Now we find, despite that agreement, that this organisation is conducting a campaign. Dr Silberberg said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have been advised by the Confederation of Australian Industry that since the National Employers Forum has removed its threat of a media campaign in return for its compromise deal individual organisations have been free to pursue a media campaign if they so wish.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Dr Silberberg said on public radio station 4QN on 15 June. As a result of that I wrote this afternoon to the convener of the National Employers Forum, Mr Ian Spicer, to ask him whether that was true. In my absence last week he had provided to the Acting Minister for Industrial Relations, the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), a letter saying that the National Employers Forum, on behalf of all its members, accepted the outcome of its negotiations with the Government. The letter was dated 12 June and signed by Mr Spicer, Chief Executive Officer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot have a situation in which the Government negotiates in good faith with an umbrella organisation and achieves a settlement with it on behalf of all its members and then finds that some of the members of that organisation, under their own banner, disavow the agreement and conduct themselves in a way that opposes what they committed themselves to through their national umbrella organisation. It is only because I have not received a reply to my letter this afternoon to Mr Spicer that I have to assume, in good faith, that Mr Spicer has acted properly and that Dr Silberberg is in fact misrepresenting the situation. I assume that the Spicer letter of 12 June does represent the situation, and the Government will press forward with the amendments that were concluded in good faith with the National Employers Forum. I make that assumption based on the fact that Mr Spicer, in his letter of 12 June, indicated that the package was acceptable to the Forum and its members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the television campaign. I have not seen the advertisement, but I have been told of its contents. It suggests that following the passage of this legislation the cost of housing in Australia will increase. It is a campaign intended to frighten electors, suggesting that industrial legislation will impose extra costs. That campaign is a lie, a damned lie, and is known to be a lie by the people who are promoting it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know the campaign to be a lie, a damned lie, and it is known by the people who have promoted it to be a lie. I have asked them to produce evidence of their assertion, but they have failed to do so. They have not produced any evidence whatsoever, and the reason they have not is that there is none. There is no evidence at all. When the Master Builders Association, which covers small builders and people in the same field as is covered by the HIA, was asked before the inquiry yesterday whether some of these allegations were true, it said&mdash;its words are in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that in its view there would be `no industrial mayhem' as the HIA had indicated there would be and that because it had agreed to the deletion of section 127A it would be `highly unlikely' that there would be an increase in housing costs at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So all I can do is repeat, in the somewhat conservative, restrained language of the MBA, that there is absolutely no support for this disreputable, dishonest and lying campaign now going to air around Australia as paid advertisements to try to scare Australians into believing that this legislation holds extra costs for them in the housing area. It does not. What it does do is enable people who are victims of unfair contracts, where they have been found to be unfair, to have some form of redress. That is a measure of social worth and justice, and in its own right it reflects, as I have said, the legislation put down by the Greiner Government in New South Wales just last year. As I say, the campaign being run against us now was not run then. We never heard a squeak out of anyone then, so one must say that this is simply a politically inspired act with no basis in fact. The campaign has been undertaken for the purpose of creating mischief, and it does not have the support of major employer organisations in this country. It is therefore an act by a few extremists, and it ought to be seen as such and condemned by ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the other amendments that we are proposing. I will spend just a minute on them. The other amendments are significant in themselves. Where the cost of using lawyers to right a legal wrong is greater than the value of the money to be gained, there is an in-built deterrent to actually recover money that is justifiably the property of people who have been gypped of it. That is a way of saying that if it costs us more to get back what we are rightfully owed the tendency is that we do not spend the extra money to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our proposal on small claims puts within the reach of every person, no matter how poor, an easy, non-expensive route to obtain moneys that have been illegally withheld from them. It is done through the courts on a small claims basis that is typical of consumer legislation in this country. It is a social justice measure which I think will be recognised in the future as being a significant change for those people at the lower end of the wage spectrum or working in areas of the market where they can be treated, because of poor skills, somewhat more reprehensively than people who have high skills and, therefore, a marketable skill and get respect from employers. Where there is low skill on low wages and high unemployment, the tendency is for victimisation. This measure means that those people can now be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other two measures are about making some greater sense of the duties of the Vice-President of the Commission. I think that is unexceptional and widely supported. The final measure makes changes to the NLCC representation to recognise the role of other principal organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that most of the debate has been about independent contractors and has reflected the swallowing of the big lie argument promoted by an extremist few. The majority of employers have now reached an accommodation with the Government. It will be interesting to see where the Opposition comes down. Will it support the mainstream employers in this country and, therefore, the outcomes which have been negotiated or will</PARA>
<PARA>it run along, as it did in the APPM dispute, with the extremists, paint itself into an extreme corner and not be relevant to the major industrial relations debate in this country? I hope that the Opposition shows sense and supports the major and mainstream employer organisations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition and some employers have continually portrayed the provisions of this legislation which deal with independent contractors as being something that they are not. I wish to answer some of the more extreme claims. This Bill is not a charter for converting independent contractors into employees. It is not intended to upset fair contractual arrangements made with genuine self-employed entrepreneurs. It is not intended to affect people who have made a free and informed genuine commercial decision to enter into a contract for services. It will not be a blueprint for massive cost increases in industry. But the Bill has been framed to prevent exploitation of those people in the work force who have been forced by unfair pressure to adopt a legal arrangement that disguises the substance of their position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill contains three distinct elements relating to independent contractors. Some of the misunderstanding and misrepresentation of the Bill arises from a lack of comprehension of how these provisions are framed and are intended to operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A preliminary point that should be made is, as I stated in my Second Reading Speech, that an independent contractor is an individual performing work under a contract for services. Let me make that quite clear. It does not mean an incorporated body, as many subcontractors are. It means an ordinary individual. The legislation was deliberately framed in that way because it is such people who are commonly subjected to the type of unfair treatment that this Bill is designed to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first element of the Bill involves expressly giving the Australian Industrial Relations Commission jurisdiction over industrial disputes about the use of independent contractors rather than employees to perform work. That jurisdiction is, under the Bill, qualified in various ways, to make it focused on the primary objective of the provisions concerning independent contractors. That objective is to ensure that the Federal industrial relations system provides appropriate remedies and protections in relation to those independent contractors who are in a position of quasi-employment. Appropriate balances are struck between the interests of genuine self-employed entrepreneurs and quasi-employees, and between those of contractors and employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not dwell on those provisions concerning such industrial disputes, because the Government proposes that they be withdrawn from the Bill. This follows extensive consultation with employer bodies. Agreement has been reached that the Commission's existing jurisdiction should be clarified through the mounting of a test case before the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second element of the provisions permits independent contractors to join federally registered unions. This is a practical and sensible provision. It permits those workers who, on a narrow, legal definition, are not employees, to choose to belong to and be represented by unions which have coverage of their work. It is a right which will be subject to certain limits and protections. It will only apply to individuals. Federally registered unions will be restricted to representing independent contractors who perform work of the same kind as the employees whom they represent. There will be wider prohibitions on discriminating against independent contractors for their membership or non-membership of unions. Unions will be prohibited from coercing contractors to become members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right of independent contractors to join federally registered unions will balance their existing right to join federally registered employer bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third element of these provisions allows the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to review contracts which are unfair, harsh or against the public interest. The primary focus of this part of the legislation is the situation where there is inequality of bargaining, in cases where a worker's economic dependence makes the worker's position one of quasi-employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill is deliberately not expressed to apply only to quasi-employment. A basic feature of problems in this area of the law is the difficulty of definition. Any attempt to define "quasi-employment" in the Bill would invite avoidance by artificial legal devices. The Government is not going to draw a precise boundary line and then watch workers being pressured to sign ingeniously-constructed contracts that put them slightly outside the boundary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that the Government's firm legislative intent is that this legislation not affect genuine, even-handed commercial arrangements with true independent contractors&mdash;that is, those individuals whose status as such is clear, not only in law, but also in social and economic reality. For example, the Government has no reason to believe that the Bill will affect the widespread use of subcontractors in the home building industry. Employer representatives have pointed to the absence of problems in this field. But it would not be appropriate for the Bill to give a blanket exemption to this area, nor to any other. If unfair contrived arrangements are found in any industry, it is proper that this legislation be available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Industrial Relations Commission is entrusted with the task of distinguishing between such unfair, contrived arrangements and proper commercial bargains. The Commission is to be free to make a commonsense decision based on the facts of each case. The Commission is to be able to deal effectively with new legal arrangements as they arise. The Commission will not be forced to work within a definition of "quasi-employee" that could force the Commission to deny fair treatment because of legal technicalities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has confidence in the Commission's ability to ensure fairness in the workplace. The Government, unlike the Opposition, has faith in the Commission and is enhancing its role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation will provide guidance for the Commission when reviewing contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 90 of the Industrial Relations Act will apply. That section specifically requires the Commission, in exercising its powers under the Act, to have regard to national economic conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission is also bound, by section 110 of the Industrial Relations Act, to act according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These considerations will guide the Commission away from routinely extending award conditions to contractors who are genuinely different from employees. To suggest that the Commission would behave in that way shows contempt for the Commission. It can be trusted to exercise its discretion properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new provisions themselves include criteria that will help the Commission to give effect properly to the Parliament's intention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed subsection 127B(4) will point the Commission to a number of specified factors that go to the genuineness of the arrangements. The relative bargaining strength of the parties, and whether there was undue pressure, are matters for</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Commission to consider. These are obviously of particular relevance to the situation of quasi-employees in an economically vulnerable position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission will also be able to decide whether there has been any attempt to evade obligations that an employer would owe to an employee. For example, the contract might be a device to avoid training obligations or occupational health and safety obligations. In this context, the Commission is asked to consider whether the contract may adversely affect skills of employees in the industry concerned. It is worth noting that the term "industry" is defined in the Industrial Relations Act in a way which ranges from an industry in its widest sense to the activities of a single employer in an industry. The meaning of the term depends on the context in which a particular matter arises. How this criterion applies, in a particular case, will depend on the circumstances of the case. The Commission will be free to decide whether a contract affects training and skills development in any way and, if so, whether it is of relevance to the particular case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same is true of the criterion relating to remuneration. The Commission may consider whether the total remuneration payable under the contract is less than that of an employee performing the same work. That is obviously relevant to a quasi-employee working under artificial arrangements. It is not relevant to a genuine commercial arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I wish to make it clear that the legislation does not provide a basis for a class action over contracts, nor any similar process. Under the proposed legislation, an application can only be made by an individual, or by a representative organisation or association on behalf of the individual, with his or her consent, in respect of that individual's contract. The provisions clearly relate only to a particular contract and the orders which the Commission will be able to make will relate only to a particular contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a number of contractors claim to be party to unfair contracts, they could seek to have their applications for review heard together. Even so, each application will have to be made separately and the Commission would have to decide, after giving all parties the opportunity to be heard, whether it was fair to hear some or all of the applications together. If the Commission decided to conduct its proceedings in that way, the Commission would have to make its decisions in relation to each contract individually. In other words, each applicant would have to persuade the Commission on the facts of his or her individual case, and any orders made by the Commission would have separate application to each contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made these remarks both to clarify certain questions which have been raised about the purpose of the legislation, and so that the Government's intention can be referred to in any proceedings before a Court or Tribunal in which questions about the operation of the legislation are raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clauses 1 to 3&mdash;by leave&mdash;taken together, and agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 4. </PARA>

<PARA>Amendment No. 1 is probably the most significant of the amendments I will be moving tonight. It deals with the removal of clause 4(d), which is in the definitions section of the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill. Amendment No. 1 deletes from the Bill the provision that would give the Australian Industrial Relations Commission jurisdiction to resolve disputes about the use of independent contractors instead of employees for the performance of work. The Government has received legal advice that the Commission already has a large part of this jurisdiction and it will be part of the Commission's normal jurisdiction to resolve disputes about the relationship between employers and employees. It would be appropriate for the High Court to be asked to clarify the interpretation of the present Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment No. 1 takes out of the Bill that section which would have clothed the Commission with the power to decide which class of worker, a contractor or an employee, should conduct what sort of work. That is the major change we intend to make. It amends clause 4(d) on page 2 of the Bill by taking out lines 28 to 36, which are in the definitions section of the Bill and deal with the powers of the Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I resume where I was up to prior to the last division, I should do one necessary mechanical thing. I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum circulated on 4 June 1992 and a replacement supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the Government's amendments and the new clause to this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the last division I was explaining the purposes of our first amendment. I had picked up an interjection from Senator Crichton-Browne which sought a better explanation than I had given up to that point as to the significance of our amendment. I thought it was a worthwhile interjection. I will complete my explanation and then yield the floor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the independent contractors section of our amending Bill there are two effective areas of change. One is about the ability of the Industrial Relations Commission to review contracts which it finds are harsh and unfair. That section, by and large, remains intact and we are not proposing to amend it significantly. The second area of change was a part which clothed the Commission with express power to make a determination and issue an order on what type of worker&mdash;an independent contractor or an employee engaged under an award&mdash;should be employed on what particular work. It is that section that amendment No. 1 deals with by removing from the definitions part the expanded definition of the powers of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the interjection from Senator Crichton-Browne&mdash;my having explained that I thought the High Court might find, if a particular case were presented to it, that the powers of the Commission were at least as extensive as the amending Bill had sought to explicitly provide for&mdash;was, `Well, as far as you're concerned, you're giving nothing away then', or words to that effect. That is true. As far as I am concerned, I do not think I am giving anything away. I think if a particular case is taken to the High Court, the High Court will so find. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is removing the explicit amendment that is proposed here in major part because on reflection and on advice I think that that is the probable outcome of such a case to the High Court, but as well because I think it is probably necessary for the High Court to be given a chance to make a decision about that before there is a legal ruling. My reading of the High Court is mine and not that necessarily of the employers or of any other group. If there is such an opportunity, I am sure the High Court will make a decision and we will all be enlightened as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments 1 and 2 are the result of extensive consultations with employers and the Australian Democrats.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to comment on the removal of this amendment to the Bill. This highlights&mdash;and I want to pick up some of the comments that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has made&mdash;the haste with which this Bill has been put together. We now have before us a Bill that is significantly different from the one that was originally brought before us. Tonight the Minister tabled a further explanation of this Bill. None of us on this side of the chamber have even had an opportunity to look at and assess what that application is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to correct a couple of things that have been said here tonight. The first relates to the MBA. It is well recorded in the evidence that was taken yesterday&mdash;and that was the MBA's documented evidence in terms of the type of housing in which it is involved&mdash;that unionisation of sites will increase costs by at least 25 per cent. That is in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the legislation committee for the Minister to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This highlights the haste with which this Bill has been put together. It also begs a number of questions in terms of the removal of this particular clause at the beginning of the Bill. It also relates to challenges to the High Court and what might come out of them. I have no doubt&mdash;particularly after the ACTU's announcement today and from what the employers who appeared before the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training yesterday said&mdash;that this Bill will end up in the High Court. That is a poor reflection on the Minister in terms of putting this legislation together. Of course the Minister is trying to achieve an increase in union power. That is what this Bill is about, and that is precisely what it will do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to comment on one other aspect relating to this increase in union power. The Minister, in his comments, referred to the position of the Housing Industry Association. Before commenting on that, I will quote what Mr Spicer said yesterday. Mr Spicer made it quite clear, as did all the other employer organisations, that he was totally opposed to the Bill, even in its amended form. All Mr Spicer said was that they were not going to continue&mdash;that is, those who are left in the NEF&mdash;with the advertising campaign, but they reserved their right to oppose the Bill to the very end. I bring this up because of the haste and the enormous number of amendments that have been made to this Bill. Mr Hamilton, the industrial officer who was with Mr Spicer, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Basically, the issue died between 1988 and April 1992. There was no activity and our views in opposition were well known on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Spicer then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And it was a surprise to us on 1 April.</PARA>
<PARA>Any talk being bandied around about the Hancock inquiry and other matters is totally irrelevant to the Bill before us tonight. I want to make the point that many, if not all, employer organisations&mdash;certainly all that have spoken to me&mdash;have said that this clause is not required as it is already covered in the Bill. That view was certainly well and truly publicly canvassed, and I am sure it was canvassed with the Minister. So it need not have been there in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make another point about the removal of this clause, and I will be speaking on some other clauses at a later stage. I point out that the Bill and this clause are not about sham contracts. The Minister mentioned today that he would have preferred that to have been addressed. But when he was asked yesterday to define a sham contract, he could not do so. He was given the opportunity to do so. Of course, we on this side of the chamber have known all the time that a definition of `sham contract' was never in this Bill. We also knew that it was never going to be in this Bill because that is not the main object of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are now dealing with in the committee stage debate is just one of the enormous number of changes to the legislation that is before us. It is ill-conceived legislation&mdash;legislation that is going to lead to increased industrial disputation and to increases in costs. No matter what the Minister or anyone else may say, there is no way that he will be able to quarantine the housing industry, or any other industry for that matter, from this legislation. The Minister knows that; I know that. Despite assurances that were given initially, and comments that were made publicly&mdash;I emphasise the word publicly&mdash;that this would not impact on the housing industry, it most definitely will impact on the housing industry. My final comment is that it really matters nought if this clause is removed from the legislation because this legislation is going to end up in the High Court of Australia. </PARA>

But I have been an employer most of my life.

Many of my friends are engaged in such operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training which looked at this Bill yesterday, I did approach this matter with a somewhat open mind. I think what impressed me was the general consensus amongst most of the people who appeared before our Committee. As my colleague Senator Crane has said, they opposed the Bill in its entirety. Even tonight the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) said that the National Employers Forum had reached agreement with him about certain matters. I quote from the executive summary that we received yesterday in which the Forum said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employers oppose all provisions of the Bill which seek to give trade unions rights and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission jurisdiction with respect to independent contractors.</PARA>
<PARA>I read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> this morning that it has already been mooted by the union movement that it is ready to run off to the High Court in a bid to prove that the Industrial Relations Commission has the power to deal with independent contractors. That is not what the contractors want. All the different organisations that spoke to us&mdash;the Master Builders Association and the Housing Industry Authority, which the Minister seems so critical of&mdash;stated that the IRC was not the appropriate place to deal with this and did not want contractors to be bound by the IRC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister said earlier that this Bill had a long gestation period. It started with Hancock. I put it to the Minister that the signs of pregnancy did not start to appear until the Troubleshooters case came on the scene. The Minister will recall that yesterday in questions from me and Senator Crane concerning the union movement in particular it was shown that the unions were very reticent to own up to the fact that they had been pushing this particular matter. In fact, towards the end of the Minister's evidence he admitted that the Troubleshooters case certainly had an influence on his thinking. I would have thought that, if this legislation was so good and so necessary, the trade union movement would have been proud to say that it initiated it and would have pressed the Minister to go on with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We get back to why we need this legislation. We have already heard where it was born. It was born after the Hancock case. One would have to ask whether the 810,000 self-employed contractors, whom the Minister identified to me yesterday in answer to a question, asked for it. I think Senator Cook said that they did not queue up at his door. It seems from the evidence we have had that the organisation did not ask for it. Certainly the NEF did not ask for it. Of all the witnesses we heard yesterday, including the ones that the Government side of the Committee had called&mdash;with the exception of Job Watch, which is an independent labour organisation funded by the Victorian Government&mdash;the ACTU, the CMFEU and the Minister were the only ones who felt that the Bill was necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contractors and subcontractors have been around ever since I can remember, and I have never had the feeling that they needed to be represented in the Industrial Relations Commission, and neither do I believe they want to be represented by the trade union movement, as my colleague Senator Crane has said. It seems to have popped up in just about every submission we have had. It seems that the major feeling is that the whole reason for this Bill is to give the trade unions the power to coerce independent contractors into the trade union movement. If we multiply one million trade union members&mdash;that figure was another estimate&mdash;by $300 each, which is the annual membership fee, we are looking at $300m. It would be quite a windfall for the trade union movement if all the contractors could be forced into it. I know that will not happen, but certainly the building workers&mdash;some 40,000 odd&mdash;would contribute something like $12m to the trade union coffers. </PARA>

I think we can put the record straight. Even you yourself, Mr Chairman, commented that section 127B (a) (b) and (c)&mdash;where the contract is unfair, harsh and against the public interest&mdash;could raise the sorts of things that could have come up under section 127A. </PARA>

I am pointing this out because the Minister indicated that they were split. They were not split, but it is quite correct that a group of them, part of the forum, believed it had negotiated as far as it could go and therefore agreed with the Minister not to pursue a television campaign against the Bill, even though it was totally opposed to the legislation.

It was patently obvious that the ACTU had initiated it. Senator Calvert drew attention to this. He said, `I don't know why the trade union movement was not proud to admit to the fact'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was really answering a query raised by my colleague Senator Calvert. What the ACTU did not want to show was that it was in fact the organ grinder and the Minister was the monkey. That is what it was about. There is no doubt that this legislation came to the fore because of what happened in the Troubleshooters case. If honourable senators look at the submission from the ACTU to the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training on page 4&mdash;if my memory is correct; I do not have it in front of me&mdash;they will see that the ACTU actually came out and said that this is what initiated this legislation. To get it to admit that in the Committee was like taking teeth out without an anaesthetic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw that to everyone's attention because that is why there are organisations such as the Housing Industry Association, which has been built on subcontractors. The whole of our housing industry has been built on subcontractors and it is very efficient. I remember some years ago doing a whole series of reports on restrictive work practices in the building industry. After our investigations, the comment was made that our major construction industry was among the most inefficient in the world and our home building industry was the most efficient. The simple reason was that the housing industry is made up of subbies. They are individual contractors who have a vested interest in being very efficient so that they can move to the next job and maximise their rate of return, their profit and the amount of money in their pockets. They are not paid on an hourly basis and their wages can be equated to that paid to a taxi driver. Of course, taxi drivers are not paid by the hour, but by the amount of work they engender themselves. It is the same with a builder, a plumber and an electrician. I thought I would clarify that point, because it is very important. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After some cursory reference to the Government's amendment No. 1, most people who have spoken on this matter have chosen to establish a position on the Bill itself. I think it is probably best if I indicate initially that I can understand the reason for amendment No. 1 and support that reason. I think something in particular should be stated with regard to the Bill as a whole: amendment No. 2 will clarify a number of matters for us because it heads towards the clarification of the definition of what the Bill is all about. The amendment is written in clear terms to avoid doubt. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is declared that a reference in this Act to an independent contractor is confined to a natural person.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with Senator Calvert's observation&mdash;I do not think it took a lot of skill on his behalf&mdash;that genuine contractors have been around ever since he could remember. I support his observation. I did not have to try very hard to notice that either. It is a fact. I contend that, although this Bill does not have the capacity to quarantine genuine contractors in any particular sector, we can look at the housing industry and observe that it is composed of a great number of self-employed contractors: people who are in business for themselves; people who, by definition, are not the subject of this legislation; and people who have been unfairly led to believe that their businesses will be destroyed by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an amendment forthcoming to clarify the fact that those people are not referred to, that the reference in this legislation is to a natural person. If people have been told that their livelihood will be destroyed, they will certainly be afraid, whether what they have been told is true or not. Those people would certainly be opposed to any suggestion of legislation which compromised their livelihoods. But we have here a specific reference to a natural person and not to the myriad of companies that have written to a number of senators, a myriad of companies engaged in the building industry which, by definition of amendment No. 2, which is a clarification, are not included. I think it is a fallacy to base a whole case on the fear that is engendered by this misinformation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other information that has been provided to us and alluded to in previous speeches is that unionisation could add significant costs to the domestic housing industry.

I will not take the trouble to dispute that assessment, but I dispute the assumption that tomorrow, or even soon after the passage of this Bill, all domestic building will be unionised by the passage of this Bill.

That is a legal matter. We in this chamber cannot be policemen; we can only be legislators.

It has put up 25 separate amendments because of its inability, inefficiency and lack of competence to draft a piece of legislation successfully. The Democrats have a few amendments, according to Senator Bell, but the Opposition has none. We are opposing the Bill in its entirety because we do not believe in the union that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) represents in this place, the BWIU, of which he was an official in Perth when it was creating all the problems it created in the West.

In one situation it denied the pilots any justice at all because Bob Hawke's mate demanded it. In the other case the Government denied the employer&mdash;an employer who was paying 25 per cent over-the-award payments. It was not questioning those payments, was not questioning giving 9 per cent superannuation to its employees, was not questioning a 35-hour week and was not questioning the generous redundancy payments when someone wished to leave; it was questioning the work practices. </PARA>

APPM found that it made a mistake. It tried to correct it, but it did so in a very bad way&mdash;an aggressive way that did not take into account the realities of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at this Bill, we are looking at a number of big questions. Do we want legalism or things to work out by negotiation through the industrial relations forums? Do we want to go into the civil courts and sort it all out there, or do it another way? That is not to say that going into the civil courts is not sometimes necessary. We all know that the last thing we want to do is go to a court because, in terms of time, cost and predictability of results, the only people who have some idea of an answer to those three factors are the lawyers and no-one else&mdash;neither the plaintiff nor the defendant. We all know that and yet, somehow or other, knowing that, the Opposition is still pushing the line that legalism is the way to solve industrial relations problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill involves the question of approach, not just specifics. It concerns how the whole Bill is framed. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has listened to the voices of all practitioners in the industrial relations area and the community. He has also listened to the voice of the 810,000 people who are currently not covered and do not get the protection that they deserve. A good industrial relations system gives security, protection and the right to be protected against exploitation. I believe that, in the long run, it gives management the right and the chance to manage in a responsible way. The options are there: we can go down the Opposition's route, or we can take the Government's route, which is an evolutionary approach to industrial relations that takes into account the fact that community expectations change. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I believe the building industry and all the other industries that use subcontract labour are terribly efficient. Small business people have never come to me saying that a contract they had signed was unfair or unconscionable. I have interceded on behalf of a number of small business people from all walks of life, particularly when the National Party was in government in Queensland. Small business used to beat a path to my door on many issues, but never once did building subcontractors or any other subcontractors come and say, `Look, we need union protection'. In fact, the opposite was the case: they tried to avoid the unions like the plague, and they still do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I employed people. I never questioned whether they were in a union. I always believed it was up to them. In fact, at one stage the transport union threatened to blackball me because I would not insist that my workers join a union. I said, `If you want to talk to them, you go and talk to them. You are quite within your rights to go into my factory and talk to them'. I was told that if they did not join a union no-one would pick up goods I wanted to send and I would be black-banned. I said, `If you want to do that, go ahead'. I must not have been a big enough fish to worry about because the black ban never took place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am at a loss to understand this Bill. It says that the way for any small business operator&mdash;whether he be a carpenter, an electrician, a plumber or whatever&mdash;to get out of this is by incorporating or forming a proprietary limited company. I would suggest that the accountants and solicitors will do very well out of this legislation. I do not know what it costs to form a corporate company now.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Troubleshooters; that was very perceptive of Senator Calvert. On appeal the case was heard by the Full Court, comprising Justices Wilcox, Burchett and Ryan. In part of the judgment concerning the facts as found by Mr Justice Woodward, the Full Court had this to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His Honour also found that the rates of pay offered to its workers were adjusted unilaterally each year by Troubleshooters without consultation with the workers who were nevertheless advised of each adjustment shortly before or immediately after it occurred.</PARA>
<PARA>In listening to this debate, the impression received from those on the other side is that they are talking about a contract that is agreed upon between two parties arguing about conditions. One side says, `We will offer you X dollars', and the other side says, `No, I want Y', and they settle on Z; or there is a discussion about conditions. There is some equality of bargaining between the parties involved. That was not the situation with Troubleshooters. In that case a body hire company, in effect, said to people, `We will arrange to get work for you on the basis that we set out'. The judgment further states, in talking about whether the relationship established was that of employee-employer or of contractor-subcontractor:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the agreement that Troubleshooters workers are not to receive annual leave or sick leave or any payment referable to those entitlements and that no deduction of income tax is to be made from their remuneration signifies a mutual intention that they are not to be regarded as employees.</PARA>
<PARA>The court used those tests to decide that they were not employees. But in using those tests the court indicated that the conditions that are necessary to protect workers were not part of the agreement that Troubleshooters put forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been asked: what disadvantage was there to people who worked under the conditions that were offered by Troubleshooters?  We come in here and quite properly deal with policy. We deal with ideas and we mention cases from time to time. I have heard of cases where people have worked under the Troubleshooters contract and have been injured. Through you, Mr Chairman, I would be interested to hear what Senator Crane has to say about this. When one hears of a family man of 28 who receives an injury and is thereafter not entitled to any workers' compensation is left bereft of any aid by way of money, bereft of any ability to work and bereft of any of those entitlements that he would get as an employee, the rosy picture that is sometimes painted in this chamber is shown to be flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The danger in the subcontracting cases where those subcontracts are of the sort put forward in the Troubleshooters case is that the people are very vulnerable to injury and to being left bereft of any benefits if they should be injured.

I certainly would not say that my colleague Senator Cooney was talking in the way that Senator Walters accused Senator Aulich of speaking.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just witnessed in the committee stage of this Bill a substitute second reading debate by a number of senators who have taken this opportunity to perambulate far and wide their views about industrial relations. I think it is also true to say that most of what they have said has no relevance whatsoever to the amendment before the Chair or, indeed, little relevance to anything in the Bill. However, that has never been a reason why people do not speak on industrial relations. I think it is a reasonable observation to make that every time the subject of industrial relations is raised, prejudices are excited and bigotries are spouted. This occasion has been no different.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of senators have prefaced their remarks with the words, `I know nothing about industrial relations', and then proceeded to tell us the nothing that they know. I would enjoin them to go and find out before they speak. Senators Bell, Boswell and Cooney have directed themselves to the amendment, or something close to the amendment, and I think they deserve some acknowledgment and reply from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments that are before the committee now are supported by the extreme organisations&mdash;the HIA and the Small Business Association. They are also strongly supported by the National Employers Forum. The Government has made these amendments after long discussion and a declaration of intent by the Australian Democrats. These amendments are not supported by the ACTU, and the ACTU has made that publicly clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the face of all that, it is passing weird that not one Opposition speaker has indicated support for these amendments. The tenor of the remarks of all the speakers is that they are opposed to them. I would be grateful to know&mdash;and I would prefer it to be shown by the vote rather than yet another intervention&mdash;whether the coalition will support the Government in making amendments which are supported by the employers and opposed by the ACTU, or whether they will oppose the amendments and support the ACTU against the Government and the employers. Not one Opposition speaker has indicated what the Opposition's intention is, and I am interested to know that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing I want to remark on is the fact that, by virtue of these amendments, what we retain as a Bill dealing with independent contractors is a more narrowly drawn version of that which exists in New South Wales legislation&mdash;legislation enacted under the Greiner Government last year. Given the excitability of the remarks made by honourable senators opposite, I would be interested to know why they never raised these questions and objected when the Greiner Government did it but do now raise these questions when we do it and provide for a national reflection of existing New South Wales State legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments we now have strip the Bill of the section that would have dealt with the broadening of the powers of the Industrial Relations Commission to determine what class of worker a contractor or a wages employee under an award should be for particular work. So the only part of the Bill that is left for independent contractors is that part which confers on the Commission the power to find in a particular case raised by an individual who may or may not be a union member whether the contract is harsh and unfair and, if it finds it is harsh and unfair, what will then rectify the contract to eliminate the harsh and unfair character of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is a fairly straightforward, reasonably humane, socially desirable enactment of law. It makes the law simple, accessible and reasonable for the ordinary person. So I would be interested in hearing from the Opposition whether it supports a simple, accessible, easy process to be engaged in to deal with harsh and unfair contracts or whether it does not support that and thus upholds harsh and unfair contracts as reasonable contracts. The question here is: does the Opposition want harsh and unfair contracts to be able to be dealt with simply, accessibly and easily or not? I have not heard from the Opposition where it stands on that. I am pretty sure that all of the people who work in the contract system would like to know whether, if they have been victims of a harsh and unfair contract, there is a way of remedying that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I resume my seat, and because the debate is shortly to be adjourned, as I understand it, I would like to refer to a number of remarks made on the broad sweep of issues which are, as I have said, not relevant. I do not want to be marked down as agreeing with the irrelevancies that have been trotted out tonight simply by not replying seriatim to each one of them. I will not bother to reply to them other than to fall back on my second reading speech and my reply to the second reading debate as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I will not let one remark go. I do think it is incumbent on me in all seriousness to reply to the remarks made by Senator Walters. I ask Senator Walters to make her remarks outside the chamber if she has any courage. I am sure she will not; that would be typical of her. She referred to the fact&mdash;a fact declared in my interests and lodged so that it is publicly accessible&mdash;that I am a member of the BWIU. I certainly was a member of the BWIU, and of that I am proud. She then went on to say that a BWIU organiser, in unnamed circumstances, threatened the life of an individual should the father or mother of that individual not comply to a certain thing. I want to have clear, in the first instance, whether Senator Walters is saying that I put my former membership of the BWIU above my oath of office as a Minister of the Crown to discharge the duties of government fairly and properly. If she is saying that, I ask her to say it outside and I will win a huge settlement from her for libel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I say that it is reprehensible in the extreme that she should trot out this allegation and then bracket that, in circumstances known to her but apparently not reported by her to the proper judicial authorities or the police for prosecution, with this event about so-called life threatening behaviour. I in no sense support illegal acts and have stood strongly against them wherever they have occurred, including within the union movement from time to time as they occurred: witness my move to deregister the BLF for that reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I in no sense accept any allegation or imputation that I am involved in that sort of threat.

<TITLE>Death of Brett Whiteley</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="3739" SPEAKER="Baume Sen M.E." NAMEID="LE4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (12.03 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak briefly on the death of Brett Whiteley who is, of course, a great loss to Australian art. Brett Whiteley became a very important artist in the 1960s. His exhibition in London at that time was hailed as a major success. He was a great fan of Francis Bacon, who also died recently. He became a great friend of Bacon's in London and painted portraits of him. Whiteley's iconic images of Sydney, of his view of Sydney from his studio in Lavender Bay, are exhibited prominently in the Art Gallery of New South Wales and have proved extremely popular with visitors to the Gallery, as was his collection of drawings of the Pont Neuf shown in recent times. In fact, there was often more interest in them than whatever large showings were on view in the main areas. During the period when he was influenced heavily by Van Gogh, he produced paintings of great worth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brett Whiteley was a popular artist. Members of the general public certainly knew his name, his paintings, his style and his face better than any other modern artist since Nolan. Until recently, I was fortunate to have two outstanding line drawings by Brett Whiteley on the wall of my office, one a lascivious outline of a woman eating an ice-cream and, the other, the back view of a female nude&mdash;both outstanding line drawings. However, there were conflicting views of Brett Whiteley's genius. Bernard Smith, in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Painting</EMPHASIS>, had this to say about Brett Whiteley:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whiteley (b. 1939) was awarded the first prize in the young painters' section at the Bathurst show at the age of seventeen. At twenty-one, following three years study at Julian Ashton's, he gained an Italian Travelling Scholarship and (after some months in Italy) reached London in 1960 at the height of the brief vogue for Australian art. His work gained instant recognition from the moment it appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Recent Australian Painting</EMPHASIS> exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in June 1961. It was purchased by the Tate, the Contemporary Art Society and the Victoria and Albert Museum. In the next few months he exhibited in group shows in Germany, Amsterdam and Paris, rounding off the year by winning the International Prize at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Biennale des Jeunes</EMPHASIS>, Paris, and representing Australia at a Young Painters' Convention organized in Paris by U.N.E.S.C.O. Since 1961 his work has been showing constantly on the international circuit and is widely known.</PARA>
<PARA>However, there were some other points made by Bernard Smith in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Painting</EMPHASIS> which reveal a different side of Brett Whiteley. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whiteley's early manner, revealed in his first one-man show held at the Matthiesen Gallery, London, in 1962, is cast in an abstract expressionist mould. . . But the temperature of Whiteley's hot-brown Australia was increased several degrees by the presence of fatty, tumescent forms poking about the rocks adventurously in a kind of primordial tumble. Erotic landscapes of this kind were being shown in Sydney at this time by Charles Reddington, Robert Hughes and others. The sexed-and-fleshed landscape is a mode which has continued to fascinate Whiteley, but into it he has added increasingly, in recent years, images of violence and death.</PARA>
<PARA>Those images appear to have caught up with Brett Whiteley the man. According to Bernard Smith:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whiteley is an uncommonly good draftsman with a splendid feeling for space, placement and accent; indeed his natural gifts have much in common with those of Toulouse-Lautrec, but a tormenting ambition to attain a profundity which is obviously not for him lies at the source of his failure. It is in his drawings and graphics of animals that his natural abilities have been allowed to flow most easily, and these constitute his most lyrical and personal statements.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that Australian art has benefited enormously from the presence of Brett Whiteley. There is no doubt that he will leave a permanent mark on the Australian art scene, and there is also no doubt that the tragic nature of his death will create even more questions about what did drive Brett Whiteley, what genius was behind him, what monkeys were on his back, and what were the pressures which drove this man to produce such magnificent works of art and yet create such concerns, disappointments and depression that he obviously felt in his personal life. He will certainly be missed from Australian art, and he has contributed an immense amount to the history of Australian art. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not intended to contribute to this debate, but Senator Baume's reference to `fatty, tumescent forms' captured my attention. As an observer of the Senate benches, it is a rather compelling image. I simply want to say that Brett Whiteley was an artist who achieved an enormous degree of recognition internationally as well as here in Australia. This is entirely deserved recognition. He was an astonishingly compelling draftsman; quite a luscious applier of paint in landscapes and portraiture&mdash;in fact in all forms of the painter's art.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Campbell:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to you in relation to a Question which you placed on the Notice Paper on 1 October 1991 seeking information on the affairs of the Oombulgurri Aboriginal Corporation in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An answer to this question, as provided by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and based on information supplied by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 4 March 1992.One part of the Question which you asked was:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Was office equipment, specifically a facsimile machine, purchased with Federal funding by the Oombulgurri Association and is the equipment now being used by a private business. The published response was no. A subsequent investigation by ATSIC revealed that the response was incorrect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1989, the Department of Social Security (DSS) under its Community Agents Program purchased a facsimile machine for the Oombulgurri Aboriginal Corporation. In 1991, the DSS funded facsimile machine broke down and was replaced by a new machine purchased from ATSIC grant funds. Both machines are located at the office of the Oombulgurri Aboriginal Corporation.To the best of ATSIC's and DSS's knowledge, neither machine has been used by a private business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A third facsimile machine was purchased by the Oombulgurri Aboriginal Corporation using ATSIC funds, when it commissioned a Wyndham firm, Top End Motors, to act as its purchasing agent for capital equipment. Top End Motors paid for the installation of cabling and Oombulgurri paid for the facsimile machine which was located in Top End Motors' office in Wyndham. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The machine was initially to be used solely for communications associated with the agency arrangements with Oombulgurri.Shortly after the installation of the facsimile machine, Top End Motors decided to purchase the machine from Oombulgurri Aboriginal Corporation, so that communications need not be restricted to business associated with the agency arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, Oombulgurri Aboriginal Corporation paid for the facsimile machine on 23 October 1991 (Cheque No 559387) once they had received a credit from Top End Motors on invoice number Vr 2127 for the cost of the machine.ATSIC has apologised to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs for the provision of incorrect advice to him. I regret any inconvenience caused to Parliament or to you as a consequence of this incorrect advice.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Occupational Superannuation Standards (OSS) legislation establishes operating standards for superannuation funds. The standards increase the protection of fund members' benefits. Of direct relevance to superannuation investments is the provision that superannuation funds should only be maintained for the purposes of providing benefits in the event of the retirement of the member, or for dependants in the event of the death of the member or for ancillary purposes. This definition underpins the `sole purpose' test for funds wishing to be eligible for tax concessions. The test entails certain safeguards for the investments of superannuation assets. Certain forms of investment (eg investment in the running of a business and speculative investments) would not generally satisfy the sole purpose test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other specific investment safeguards in the OSS legislation include standards regarding restrictions on loans to members, borrowing except for temporary finance purposes and in-house assets. Another investment standard is that fund investments should be made on an arm's length basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, trustees of superannuation funds are subject to the `prudent man' requirement in trust/ trustee laws. This requires that trustees must take such care as an ordinary prudent person would take if he were minded to make an investment for the benefit of other people for whom that person felt morally bound to provide. This standard together with the general duty of trustees to act in the best interest of members entail that superannuation trustees invest assets to achieve the highest returns obtainable, consistent with acceptable levels of risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also draw the Senator's attention to the former Treasurer's Statement of 20 August 1991 that the Government wants to ensure there is an adequate prudential framework to improve the security of superannuation savings and that over the coming months it would announce a series of measures on prudential supervision of the superannuation industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) As announced in the Statement of 20 August 1991, the Government recognises that there is an obligation on it to provide an appropriate prudential framework for superannuation but does not believe that it can or should attempt to guarantee superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes. Under the OSS legislation, a fund's accounts must be audited annually by an independent auditor for the fund to be eligible for concessional taxation treatment. However, the ISC supplements this self-assessment approach to the administration of the OSS legislation with audits of superannuation funds. The Government announced in the 1991 Budget Statement that additional resources would be given to the Commission to upgrade its audit function.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commissioner of Taxation established the Capital Gains Tax Specialist Cell within the Australian Taxation Office to deal with and resolve the most difficult and complex issues involving the capital gains provisions of Part IIIA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. As part of its functions, the Cell issues Determinations as a means of quickly disseminating the ATO's views on the operation of those provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where the profit or any other amount received from a transaction is income under ordinary concepts, and the capital gains provisions also apply in respect of the receipt, the effect of subsection 160ZA(4) is that the amount will generally be assessable only as income. That is, the application of the capital gains provisions will rarely need to be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether the profit or other amount received from a transaction is capital or income can only be determined in light of the facts of each transaction. The ATO has recently issued an Exposure Draft Taxation Ruling, EDR 72, "Income Tax: profits on isolated transactions" which considers the factors the ATO considers relevant in determining whether or not the profit is income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the question of the distinction between income and capital is one of interpreting the general income tax law, it is not a question with which the Capital Gains Tax Specialist Cell would generally deal. In addition, as the matter has been addressed by the Exposure Draft Taxation Ruling, the Commissioner has advised that the Cell will not also issue a determination on that matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chief forms of protection for these goods are tariffs and quotas. Quotas only apply to goods in the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. Items of a good subject to quota may be imported either within quota, or out of quota. While items imported out of quota attract a lower tariff rate, they also incur a flat levy on each item. The flat levy is generally large compared to the import price, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">so the rate of duty payable is much more than on goods imported within quota.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since import prices can vary over a wide range, rates of assistance expressed as a percentage of purchase price can be misleading where imports take place without a quota. Export facilitation and import credit schemes also provide protection to the passenger motor vehicle and textile, clothing and footwear industries, respectively. However, this assistance cannot be allocated to single products. Furthermore, effective rates of assistance (ERAs) are calculated as averages over industries, and do not apply to particular products in multi-product industries. Effective rates of assistance measure the net assistance to an industry's value added. Net assistance includes assistance to output and value adding factors, and the effect of government interventions (eg tariffs, excise taxes and input subsidies) on input costs. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) In response to an application (Application No. 8007/77) of the Republic of Cyprus against Turkey, the Report of the European Commission on Human Rights concerning Turkish human rights violations in Cyprus was adopted by the Council of Europe on 4 October 1983. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe decided to release the report publicly on 2 April 1992. I understand that in terms of procedure the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe has resolved to take no further action on the case. The Australian Government does not plan to take any action on the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Australian Government accepts the conclusions of the European Commission on Human Rights that Turkey violated various articles of the European Convention on Human Rights. The conclusions are in accordance with our understanding of the situation in Cyprus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Given the length of time since the Report was adopted by the Council of Europe and the decision of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe that no further action be taken on this case the Australian Government has not made any representations since the report was publicly released. The Australian Government, however, takes an active interest in the human rights situation in Cyprus. The Australian Government supports the United Nations Secretary-General's efforts to mediate a solution to the divisions which beset Cyprus. It is also monitoring the progress of the bipartisan Committee on Missing Persons. It is the hope of the Australian Government that both will aid in the swift resolution of the human rights problems in Cyprus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 26 February 1992, at the 48th Session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, the leader of the Australian Delegation stressed that Australia fully supported the efforts of the United Nations SecretaryGeneral to achieve a settlement of the Cyprus problem.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Australian Government is not in a position to provide legal assistance to Australian citizens of Greek Cypriot origin who have been deprived of property and possessions in Cyprus. First, the Australian Government does not, as a general rule, provide legal assistance to Australian citizens involved in legal actions outside Australia. Secondly, the Australian Government has no substantive role to play because, under the relevant principles of international law, a government can only espouse such a cause to another government on behalf of a person who was a citizen of the pleading country at the time the loss or injury occurred and who was continuously a citizen of that country until the time representation was made.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Civil war continues in southern Sudan, where the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA), led by John Garang, is seeking to persuade the Sudanese government to accept a constitutional arrangement which would guarantee full and equal political and economic rights for the Christian and animist minorities. The Sudanese government launched its latest offensive in southern Sudan early this year. A number of towns previously in SPLA hands have fallen to government forces. Peace talks commenced under the chairmanship of the Nigerian government in Abuja, Nigeria, on 26 May 1992. Discussions between the government and rebel factions have been procedural, but are now to cover regional revenue sharing, judicial practice, and religious freedoms. The Australian Government hopes that a peaceful solution to the civil war will soon be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Declining economic conditions in Sudan have been exacerbated by a combination of military conflict and drought. Recent estimates put the number of drought-affected and war-affected persons requiring urgent food assistance at about 7.2 million. In the South, the cash economy is virtually non-existent and the people have resorted to barter mechanisms. Communications systems have broken down and no transport is available apart from that provided by international aid organisations. The Australian Government was concerned by the decision taken by the Sudanese government in March 1992 to ban relief flights by international aid organisations. We welcomed the recent partial lifting of this ban, but we remain disturbed by the continuing harassment of international aid organisations. We have conveyed our concerns to representatives of the Sudanese government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite assurances by the Sudanese government that all Sudanese citizens would be treated equally, the Christian minority in Sudan, which is based mainly in the South, has become increasingly alienated. The Catholic Church, for example, has complained that the education system is designed to convert the entire population to Islam, notwithstanding the existence of non-Arabic speaking, non-Muslim groups, which include not only Christians, but many animist tribal groups of southern Sudan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sudan is a party to the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and to the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. It has signed, but not ratified, the Convention against Torture. The human rights situation in Sudan was considered by the Commission on Human Rights at its 47th and 48th sessions (1991 and 1992) under its confidential procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has made representations to the Sudanese Government on individual human rights cases and on the Sudanese government's forced mass relocation of displaced persons. In March this year, Sudan, when responding to representations the Australian Government had made on some individual human rights cases, issued an invitation to the Amnesty International Parliamentary Group (AIPG) to visit Sudan to obtain first-hand information about the human rights situation there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the recent visit to Australia of the (non-resident) Sudanese Ambassador to present credentials, I took the opportunity to express the Australian Government's concern about the difficulties faced by international aid organisations in delivering relief supplies and services and about the human rights situation in Sudan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Anti-Slavery International Society for the Protection of Human Rights (ASI), a British-based human rights organisation, made submissions to the United Nations Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery in 1987 and 1988 alleging that people taken captive in military operations in Sudan were being forced into slavery. ASI's 1988 annual journal also contained a report to this effect. It has not produced further reports or submissions on the subject since then. We understand that Africa Watch, an American-based human rights group, is monitoring the situation. Sudan is a party to the Slavery Convention of 1926 (as amended) and to the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade and Institutions and Practices of Slavery.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Guidelines applicable to the broadcasting of violent or sexually explicit material on television are contained in Section 118 of the Broadcasting Act 1942 (the Act) and in program standards determined and administered by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 118 of the Act states that the Corporation (ABC) or a licensee shall not broadcast matter which is blasphemous, indecent or obscene. The test of obscenity and indecency is whether the matter in question offends to a substantial degree the sexual modesty of the average man or woman in the Australian community or offends to a substantial degree the contemporary standards of decency currently accepted by the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABT's Television Program Standards specify in broad terms what kinds of material may be shown at particular times of the day. The ABC is also required to take account of these standards in its provision of television services within Australia. A licensee must ensure that any program to be transmitted has assigned to it a classification (AO, PGR, G, C or P) which is appropriate. This classification is determined by criteria which specify the degree of violence, sex and nudity that can be portrayed and also indicates the times at which such programs may be broadcast. Other standards specify what is allowable in program promotions and during children's viewing time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABT is currently conducting an Inquiry into Television Program Standard (TPS) 12 (Promotions for Programs) and undertaking a major review of its classification standards for programs and advertisements on commercial television.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of a key recommendation of the ABT's Inquiry into Violence on Television (1988-1990), the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations in 1991 launched The Portrayal of Violence on Television: A Code of Industry Practice. This code which is agreed to and supervised by the ABT, deals specifically with the program areas in which violence is most commonly an issue. Whilst the Code itself contains no penalties or policing mechanisms, the Tribunal has scope to review broadcasters' performance in relation to the Code during licence renewals or if it has reason to believe that broadcasters are acting in serious or repeated disregard of the Code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABT's review of the television coverage of the massacre at Strathfield by the Sydney commercial stations found that the industry's code had been applied successfully. The Tribunal received a minimal number of complaints about this coverage indicating, in their view, that the Code is being effectively applied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) A decision in favour of Pay TV is not a green light for the transmission of pornographic material that offends community standards of taste and decency. The Government will not under any circumstances allow X-rated material to be screened on Australian television.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If R-rated programs are transmitted, this would be permitted only in conjunction with an approved technical lock-out device. These devices could comprise special smart cards that are issued only on request to adults, and/or personal identification numbers as many of us now use with our bank accounts. This would allow parents to control access by children to programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has consistently stated that it does not foresee the circumstances whereby Pay TV programming would include anything that would offend against accepted community standards. Detailed regulatory provisions have been spelt out in the Broadcasting Services Bill 1992 that was introduced into the Senate on 4 June 1992. The Bill proposes that Codes of Practice be developed by all broadcasters in the area of program classification. The codes would be required to reflect the Office of Film and Literature Classification system. The codes must be registered with the regulatory authority, the Australian Broadcasting Authority. If they are not operating to provide appropriate community safeguards, mandatory program standards may be introduced by the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulatory authority will have significant powers to deal with breaches of standards and the provisions of the Act.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Social Security, in conjunction with a company with expertise in this area, has been developing a touch screen system for use in the Department.

During the trial it is planned to locate the touch screen equipment for part of the time in the Bellerive CES office Tasmania which is co-located with the Department of Social Security's Regional Office. This trial includes some community information which has been developed from local pamphlets. The next phase of the trial will be to develop a multi-lingual service. This will be located in the Cabramatta Regional Office, NSW. Plans for incorporating other government agencies' information have not been developed at this stage but if the trials show high acceptance of the touch screen technology this could certainly be pursued.</PARA>
