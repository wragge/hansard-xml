<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AVIATION FUEL REVENUES (SPECIAL APPROPRIATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill makes technical amendments to the Aviation Fuel Revenues (Special Appropriation) Act to enable reductions to be made to the avgas Excise and customs Duty rate while preserving the Civil Aviation Authority's revenue entitlement under the Act. The purpose of the amendments is to permit the phasing out of the collection of that proportion of avgas duty that is directly attributed to the Department of Transport and Communications's aerodrome cost recovery programme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In August 1990 the Government announced its intention to transfer the remaining Commonwealth-owned aerodromes to full local ownership and to encourage aerodrome owners who are receiving funding under the Aerodrome Local Ownership Plan (ALOP) to accept full financial responsibility for their aerodromes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the number of aerodromes financially supported by the Government is reduced there is a corresponding reduction in Government outlays. The Government has given a commitment to the aviation industry to pass on savings through the progressive reduction of the rate of Excise and Customs Duty on avgas. This Bill will enable this commitment to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current rate of duty on avgas is 27.480 cents /litre of which 3.010 cents is attributable to aerodrome cost recovery purposes. The balance of the duty is attributable to cost recovering aviation functions carried out by the Civil Aviation Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill enables the 3.010 cents to be phased out while retaining the existing level of revenue entitlements that the Civil Aviation Authority has under the present Act. At the same time the amendments enable the Civil Aviation Authority with the agreement of the Minister to vary the amount of revenue it receives for cost recovery purposes from the duty. This preserves the intent of the arrangements under the present Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will allow immediate amendment of the Customs and Excise Tariffs to provide a 1 cent reduction in the avgas duty. A further 1 cent reduction in the avgas duty will take place when the combined number of Commonwealth Aerodromes and ALOP Aerodromes is reduced to 100. The final component of duty attributable to the aerodrome cost recovery programme is scheduled to be removed in June 1993 when the aerodrome transfer and withdrawal process is anticipated to be completed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is a reflection of the tangible benefits which are flowing to the general aviation industry from the Government's aviation reforms, in particular its policies on aerodrome local ownership.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BACKGROUND</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When this Government took office in 1983, most people would look to the age pension as their main source of retirement income.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reform of superannuation has been one of the great achievements of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over its term of office, the Government has greatly expanded access to superannuation savings. In particular, award superannuation has fostered the spread of superannuation to large areas of the work force which previously had no cover.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has also restructured the tax concessions for superannuation to make them more consistent with retirement incomes objectives, while still maintaining them at a generous level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, access to superannuation concessions has been made substantially more equitable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These reforms have moved superannuation from being a concessionally taxed source of windfall gains for high income earners towards being a genuine retirement savings vehicle for most Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When we came to office, 40 per cent of the work force had some superannuation cover; in 1991, the proportion was 72 per cent. On this basis alone, our reforms of superannuation are an achievement which the retirees of the future will value highly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite these reforms, there is an ongoing need to ensure that as many Australians as possible have access to superannuation. There is also a need to increase the average level of superannuation savings for each individual, if these savings are to provide an adequate level of retirement income. Consistent with these goals, the Superannuation Guarantee Levy was announced in last year's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Superannuation Guarantee Levy represents another major step forward in the development of retirement incomes policy. It will lay the foundation for income security and higher standard of living in retirement for future generations of retirees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Superannuation Guarantee Levy provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a major extension of superannuation coverage;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">an efficient method of encouraging employers to comply with their award obligations; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">an orderly mechanism by which employer superannuation support can be increased over time, consistent with the economy's capacity to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Levy will consolidate the reforms implemented since 1983, and will provide a coherent and equitable framework in which retirement incomes objectives can be progressed. It will ensure that by the beginning of the next century, virtually all employees will be accumulating substantial superannuation savings to help fund their retirement income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increased self-provision for retirement will permit a higher standard of living in retirement than if we continued to rely on the age pension alone. The increased self-provision will also enable future Commonwealth Governments to improve the retirement conditions for those Australians who were unable to fund adequately their own retirement incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lastly, self-provision will increase the flexibility in the Commonwealth's budget in future years, especially as our population ages and will increase our national savings overall, thus reducing our reliance on the savings of foreigners to fund our development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December last year an Information Paper was released for comment on issues raised by the operation of the Superannuation Guarantee Levy. The Government then undertook wide ranging consultations on the issues raised by the Information Paper. As a result of the consultation process, this package of measures contains some changes to the proposals outlined in that Information Paper.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HOW THE SUPERANNUATION GUARANTEE SCHEME WILL WORK</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill, which applies from 1 July 1992, will encourage employers to provide a minimum level of superannuation support for employees. Where employers provide less than the minimum level of superannuation support, they will be liable for a superannuation guarantee charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The superannuation guarantee charge&mdash;which will not be a deductible expense for employers&mdash;will be used to meet the superannuation contribution entitlements of the relevant employee and will be used, as I discuss later, to fund administration costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should stress that this mechanism is not intended to be the principal vehicle for the funding of employees' own contribution entitlements. It is intended, instead, to be an incentive for employers to meet their own obligations, and to be a support mechanism for employees where those obligations are not met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In introducing the Levy, the Government has been particularly conscious of minimising the labour cost impact of the Levy on employers. We have designed the Levy to be a floor under existing superannuation arrangements. All existing employer superannuation support, that meets the provisions of the Levy arrangements, will count towards the minimum prescribed level of support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The level of superannuation support an employer is expected to provide will depend on the employer's annual payroll. For the 1992-93 year, employers with an annual payroll in excess of $500,000 will be expected to contribute 5 per cent of an employee's earnings base to a complying superannuation fund. This percentage will increase over the next nine years to 9 per cent. Employers with an annual payroll of $500,000 or less will be required to contribute 3 per cent increasing on a slower transition schedule to 9 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An employee's earnings base will depend on whether the employer was providing superannuation support for employees on 20 August 1991. Employers who, on that date, were contributing to a superannuation scheme which has an earnings base, can continue to use that earnings base so long as it is not reduced. This will help minimise compliance costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any other case, the employer will be assessed against an earnings base that the employer is required to use under an industrial award or a base not less than ordinary time earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Superannuation support must be provided through a complying superannuation fund in order to be counted towards the minimum level of superannuation support. The fund can be either a defined contribution fund or a defined benefit fund. In the case of a defined benefit fund, the employer will be required to obtain an actuarial certificate specifying the level of employer superannuation support implicit in the benefits available to employees in the fund. For all other funds, the employer's level of support will be based on the actual contributions made to the fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The level of superannuation support will be measured on a financial year basis for the 1992-93 year. However, where an employer has provided insufficient superannuation support during that year, the employer will be able to make up any shortfall in contributions by 14 August 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has decided that from the 1993-94 year and subsequent years, employer support will be measured on a monthly basis. The employer will be expected to provide the minimum level of superannuation support either before or during the month (or within 28 days of the end of the month). However, if there is a shortfall in employer superannuation support, the superannuation guarantee charge will not be due until 14 August in the next financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If an employer does not provide the minimum level of superannuation support, a charge will be imposed on the employer. The charge will be equal to the sum of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the total of the employer's individual superannuation guarantee shortfalls;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">an interest component; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">an administration component.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A superannuation shortfall for an employee is calculated by applying to the employee's salary and wages the percentage difference between the minimum level of superannuation support and the actual employer support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The interest component is a proxy for superannuation fund earnings. The interest will be calculated from the commencement of the financial year until the time the superannuation guarantee charge is due to be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the administration charge is to recover some of the costs incurred in administering the tax. The charge will initially consist of a flat amount of $50 plus an amount of $30 for each employee in respect of whom the employer has a superannuation shortfall.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AWARD SUPERANNUATION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has decided to support the inclusion in existing superannuation award provisions of the rates of contribution to superannuation funds required by the Superannuation Guarantee Scheme as they become operative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that, where there is no agreement between the parties to an existing award superannuation provision nominating a particular fund, the fund to which such additional award contributions are to be made should be determined by the relevant industrial tribunal looking to the best interests of the beneficiaries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Superannuation Guarantee Scheme is designed to encourage employers to provide a minimum level of superannuation support. It is intended to improve the position of those employees who have inadequate superannuation coverage. It is not designed to provide a mechanism for a general increase in superannuation support for those employees who are already receiving in excess of the prescribed minimum level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government expects that increases in the prescribed minimum level would not result in additional contributions in cases where employers were already providing superannuation support at or above that level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, parties are free to negotiate levels of superannuation support above the minimum as part of enterprise agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many employers already provide such higher levels, often through a combination of contributions to industry funds and employer funds. In such cases, the Government expects negotiations between the parties on a case-by-case basis would determine the fund or funds to which Superannuation Guarantee/award contributions would be made. Any breakdown in negotiations should be referred to the relevant industrial tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">EXEMPTIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Superannuation Guarantee Scheme, an employer will not be expected to provide superannuation support for employees who are under 18 years of age and who are working part-time. Income earned by a person as a member of the Defence Force Reserves will also not be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of comments on the Information Paper, the Government has also decided to exempt:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">employees who earn less than $250 a month;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">employees who are aged 65 or over;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">non-resident employees who are paid for work undertaken outside Australia;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">resident employees who are employed by non-resident employers and are paid for work undertaken outside Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"prescribed employees" (to be defined in Regulations), ie employees who are overseas executives of international corporations who come to Australia on a temporary basis to establish a branch of the company or to join an existing branch in a managerial or executive capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the previously announced weekly and annual threshold exemptions will no longer apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The revised exemptions are designed to ensure that virtually all employees receive superannuation support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be a maximum limit of $80,000 per annum (indexed) on the annual earning to which the superannuation guarantee requirements will apply in respect of any individual employee. That is, the superannuation guarantee will apply to the first $80,000 of salary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ADMINISTRATION OF THE SCHEME</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner of Taxation will be responsible for administering the Superannuation Guarantee Scheme. The scheme will be administered on a self-assessment basis with generally only those employers who are liable to pay the superannuation guarantee charge required to furnish a statement to the Australian Taxation Office. The statement and charge will be required to be lodged and paid by 14 August in the following financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">REDISTRIBUTION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Revenue collected under the Bill will be placed in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. An amount equivalent to the charge, less the administration component will be redistributed to a complying superannuation fund for the benefit of those employees in respect of whom the charge was paid. Employees will have a choice as to which fund these amounts go to.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Information Paper a number of amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act were proposed. These amendments were included in the Superannuation Guarantee (Consequential Amendments) Bill introduced on 30 April 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minimum level of support required by the superannuation guarantee will have to be compulsorily preserved from 1 July 1993. The Government has decided to extend this deadline from 1 July 1992, to provide time for schemes to amend their trust deeds where necessary. Employers will, however, remain liable to provide the minimum required level of vested benefit to all non-exempt employees from 1 July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FINANCIAL MARKET</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is estimated that employers will remit an insignificant amount of charge in the 1992-93 year and $17 million in subsequent years of which amount $15 million is expected to be redistributed for employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes these measures represent a major step forward in the development of retirement incomes policy and will lay the foundation for income security and higher standards of living in retirement for virtually all workers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandums for this Bill and for the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT (MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS) BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill proposes amendments to the Commonwealth Employees Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 ("The CERC Act") and the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 ("The OH&amp;S Act"). It also proposes technical, drafting and consequential amendments to other Acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions of the Bill are explained in the explanatory memorandum. I propose to therefore confine my comments to the major amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main focus of the Bill is to continue the reform of Commonwealth employees' compensation arrangements in line with the recommendations of the Brown Review of the Comcare program. In this, it fulfils the Government's undertaking that this would be done in the present sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees ("The Commission") which operated as Comcare, was established under the CERC Act. Its purpose was effectively to manage the Commonwealth Public Sector Workers' Compensation System. The Commission's role in the prevention of workplace injury and disease through improved occupational health and safety practices and the rehabilitation of injured workers was emphasised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December 1990, Mr Ron Brown, a Management Consultant, was commissioned to carry out a comprehensive review of the Comcare program. The Brown review involved consideration of the effectiveness of the Comcare scheme and recommendation of policy and legislative changes needed to better achieve the Government's objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review acknowledged the success of improvements in workers' compensation arrangements and policy achieved by the commission since its establishment under this Government. Nevertheless it targeted additional areas where effectiveness could be enhanced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December 1991, the first step in implementing the Brown Review's recommendations was taken. The Commission was restructured as a regulatory body distinct from Comcare and with a separate chairperson. It is responsible for regulatory functions associated with the CERC Act and the OH&amp;S Act. This includes determining compensation premiums.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comcare was restructured as a service delivery body, headed by its chief executive officer. It is responsible for commercial administrative and service functions under the legislation, including providing support to the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill deals with two important measures designed to implement other important recommendations of the Brown Review. The Bill covers:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The licensing of Commonwealth authorities to perform certain functions under the CERC Act in respect of their own employees under the supervision of the Commission;   and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Improvements in relation to Comcare's financial arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn first to the proposed regime for the licensing of Commonwealth authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the CERC Act in 1988, provision was made for both Australia Post and Telecom to become self-administrators of the Commonwealth Workers' Compensation Scheme. This was for a two year trial period. Under these arrangements the two organisations were responsible for all aspects of the administration of the CERC Act for their employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Brown Review recommended that these self-administration arrangements should end, and be replaced with a system of licences for self-insurance and in-house claims management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill provides for the implementation of that recommendation. It does so in a way that is consistent with preserving flexibility and increasing efficiency in the operation of the Commonwealth's employee compensation arrangements. But, at the same time, it will ensure that the licensed authorities operate under an appropriate system of regulation by the Commission. That system of regulation will, among other things, ensure consistency of practice between Comcare and the licensed authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth authorities will be able to apply to the Commission for licences under the Act. The Commission will have the power to grant or refuse applications, based on their consideration against criteria set out in the legislation. An application fee will need to be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new arrangements will allow the Commission to issue three classes of licence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A class 1 licence will allow an authority to operate as a self-insurer. The licence will transfer to the licensed authority all or part of Comcare's obligation to compensate its employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A class 2 licence will allow an authority to determine its own claims. The license will transfer to the licensed authority, wholly or in part, Comcare's function of determining its employees claims under the CERC Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A class 3 licence will allow an authority to self-insure and determine the claims of its employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Licences are to be subject to a system of conditions set out in the CERC Act, as well as other conditions imposed on a case-by-case basis by the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal statutory conditions are to be requirements that licensed authorities comply with the CERC Act and pay their annual license fees. The conditions able to be set by the Commission will include conditions limiting the maximum liability for which a licensed authority may self-insure, or in respect of which it may make a determination. If a limit is imposed by way of a condition, then once exceeded, liability to make payments or to determine a claim, or both, will revert to Comcare depending on the class of license.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another possible condition to which a self-insurance licence may be made subject is a requirement that the licensed authority obtain specified bank or other guarantees or other specified securities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises that consistency, equality and independence of decision-making are of paramount importance in these processes, particularly at the review stage. Accordingly, the Commission will be able to impose a condition on a licence that the reconsideration of claims determined by a class 2 or class 3 licence holder be carried out by Comcare or another authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure consistency and equality of decision-making, licence holders will be obliged to comply with guidelines issued by the Commission.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Commission will be able to give a direction to a licensed authority either generally or in respect of a particular matter or class of matters. Licensed authorities are to be required by the CERC Act to comply with such directions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is anticipated that, exercising its powers, the Commission will set performance standards to be achieved and maintained by license holders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because a licensed authority will be bound, as a condition of its license to comply with the Act, a failure to comply with guidelines or directions of the Commission will involve a breach of that condition. The Commission will be able to suspend a class 2 or class 3 license or revoke a licence of any class for breach of any condition. It will also be able to direct a licensed authority to comply with conditions of the licence. The provisions of the Bill also detail the effects of a suspension or revocation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Bill's provisions the current self-administering authorities, Australia Post and Telecom, will hold class 3 licences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second group of amendments proposed by the Bill, linked to the implementation of the Brown Review, concerns the financial arrangements under the CERC Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comcare will be allowed to enter into arrangements under which it will provide and charge fees for agreed services related to the performance by Comcare of its functions under the CERC Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also included are provisions under which Comcare will collect premiums under the CERC Act on behalf of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill aims at simplifying the operation of the CERC Act by including a special or standing appropriation. There will be payable to Comcare the moneys necessary to meet undischarged liabilities for claims under the previous compensation arrangements. In addition, Comcare will also be paid amounts equal to the administrative costs attributable to these claims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will also be payable to Comcare the moneys necessary to discharge its liabilities for claims under the CERC Act and to cover administrative costs associated with those claims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amounts available to Comcare under this second head are limited to the amounts of premiums it has collected together with notional interest on such of those premiums as have not from time to time been paid out, less previous payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Finance may determine the opening balances for the special appropriations and the rate of notional interest to be applied to the balance from time to time in the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also makes provision for corporations in which the Commonwealth has a substantial interest to be brought under the coverage of either or both of the CERC Act and the OH&amp;S Act by ministerial declaration. The Government's intention is that such coverage will not be mandatory. It is intended to be granted after consultation with other Ministers involved and at the request of the boards of management of the relevant organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 5 of this Bill provides for the recovery of the costs of administration of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991. This will have two aspects&mdash;fees for certain services and general contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission will be able to enter into arrangements with departments and authorities under which it will provide and charge for agreed services. Comcare is to be given a similar power under the CERC Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commission will also be able to estimate contributions that are to be payable by all departments and authorities covered by the OH&amp;S Act. In this way each department and authority will contribute to the cost of administering the Act based on its own occupational health and safety record, and having regard to other specified matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will provide departments and authorities with a financial incentive to improve occupational health and safety programs, and will assist in ensuring a safe and healthy working environment for commonwealth employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A two-stage process of review of estimated contribution will be available. Estimates will be reviewed first by the Commission and then, if the department or authority concerned wishes it, by the Minister. Departments and authorities will be required to provide relevant information and to pay interest on late payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this Bill represents an important stage in the successful implementation of changes to the workers' compensation system based on the recent Brown Review of the Comcare program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill represents substantial progress in the Government's continuing reform of the Commonwealth Employees Compensation System.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments proposed in the Bill are not expected to have a significant financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The costs of licensing, and of regulation of licensed authorities, under the CERC Act are to be recovered from those authorities through application and annual fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The standing, or special, appropriations proposed to be inserted in the CERC Act will take the place of annual appropriations and are limited in their scope.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost recovery arrangements proposed for the OH&amp;S Act may result in some savings in annual appropriations to the extent that costs are recovered from non-budget dependent agencies. Costs or savings in respect of budget dependent agencies are dependent upon the annual budget process and cannot be quantified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">STATES AND NORTHERN TERRITORY GRANTS (RURAL ADJUSTMENT) AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill amends several of the provisions of the current Rural Adjustment Scheme (RAS) which was introduced in January 1989 following an extensive review. At the time of setting up this revised Scheme it was envisaged that it would operate in a more flexible and innovative way to address more adequately the changing structural adjustment forces acting in the Australian agricultural sector and to more closely match the requirements for assistance of individual farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the first years of the revised Scheme, the rural economy was generally buoyant but towards the end of 1990 it had become apparent that the sector was experiencing the beginning of a severe downturn and that a number of farmers were facing financial difficulties as a result of depressed commodity prices. This was to be the first real test of the adequacy of the Scheme. In Queensland and northern New South Wales the severe drought in 1991 exacerbated the difficulties being faced by farmers in those areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Primary Industries and Energy undertook assessments in April and October 1991 to determine whether the assistance measures available under the Scheme were adequate to meet the pressures placed on individual farming families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It became apparent as a result of these assessments that additional measures would need to be introduced to assist farmers with long term prospects, but in financial difficulties, as a result of the downturn. The resultant changes to the Scheme augmented the existing measures which would assist in maintaining the basis for an internationally competitive rural base. Funding was progressively increased from $62.45 million in 1990&mdash;91 to $193.91 million for 1991&mdash;92 and at present some 10,000 farmers are receiving RAS assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These variations, in conjunction with other initiatives such as the modification of hardship provisions under the Social Security Act have provided a safety net for those farmers facing severe financial difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is provision under the Agreement to amend the terms and provisions available under the Scheme provided that the concurrence is sought from State and Territory Ministers. This provision has been particularly useful as it has allowed access to the assistance without delay. The first two amendments have been made by Agreement between the Commonwealth and the States and Northern Territory. It is now appropriate to bring these amendments before the Commonwealth Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third amendment being introduced at this time is to formally extend the Scheme to the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). Following self government, the Territory has assumed responsibility for program delivery. There has been very little demand for assistance under the Scheme by the Territory's farmers as there are only 230 farmers in the ACT of which approximately 25% would be assessed as being bona fide farmers under the criteria laid out in the Agreement. Under the current arrangements, New South Wales has been acting as an agent for the administration of the Scheme where there has been a need for assistance for ACT farmers. While there has been little demand to date, it is only equitable that those few genuine farmers in the ACT should also have access to the RAS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first initiative to be introduced was the new measure available under Part A of the Scheme entitled "Debt Restructuring with Interest Subsidies" or DRIS. Farmers, who have long term prospects in farming, but due to various reasons including low incomes, are not able to obtain further finance from their creditors, may be eligible for an interest subsidy on their existing debts. This measure was designed to improve farmers' cash flows. This provision has been applied with other measures available under the RAS, such as the support to obtain carry&mdash;on finance to meet the individual needs of farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the Prime Minister's Economic Statement in February 1992, additional funds were provided which will assist some farmers to plant broadacre and sugar crops in the 1992 winter and 1992&mdash;93 summer crop planting seasons. The crop planting scheme is designed to support the provision of working capital for crop plantings and raise confidence in the broadacre industries. For this purpose broadacre crops have been defined as cereals, coarse grains, oilseeds, peanuts and grain legumes. Needy producers in the sugar industry are also included. These industries are in need of working capital.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Assistance for crop planting has been available since March 1992 under Part B of the Scheme. Support is in the form of a 75 percent interest subsidy on their commercial crop planting loans. Under the terms and provisions that have been agreed with the States, to be eligible for assistance the farm enterprise should be profitable in the long term, but unable to obtain sufficient commercial carry&mdash;on finance to undertake normal cropping programs. Assistance will be limited to a maximum $10,000 subsidy and can be used for normal crop planting expenses such as wages, seed, fertiliser, fuel and repairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the development of a national drought policy, the provision of relief for farmers affected by dry seasonal conditions is provided under Part B of the Scheme. This component supports farmers in financial difficulties through causes beyond their control, to obtain carry&mdash;on finance through the provision of interest subsidies on commercial borrowings. Part B assistance was activated in 1991 primarily because of the severe financial hardship being suffered by many farmers as a result of the low commodity prices, but this situation was compounded in Queensland and northern New South Wales by the severe drought conditions in the latter part of the year. Under the arrangements for the current Scheme, funding for Part B has been shared equally by the Commonwealth and the States. In recognition of the difficulty of some States to provide matching funds, the Commonwealth agreed in October 1991 to alter the funding contribution. Under the revised funding arrangements for Part B, the Commonwealth will provide two dollars for each dollar provided by the States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Scheme has, in general, withstood the considerable pressures exerted by the downturn and drought. These new measures have contributed significantly to the effectiveness of the Scheme. They have complemented the measures already available under the Scheme as well as a number of other Commonwealth and state programs that have also been under similar pressure to support the rural sector through this crisis. Evidence suggest that 1991&mdash;92 will prove to be the lowest point of the adverse conditions in the sector and that 1992&mdash;93 will see a recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Scheme is currently being evaluated in line with Government policy of regularly reviewing the effectiveness of its programs. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy  will be reporting on the outcome of this review to the next meeting of the Agricultural Council of Australia and New Zealand at the end of July. The evaluation may recommend the need to further modify the Scheme in order to meet the primary objective of ensuring structural adjustment in the industry. The manner in which the Scheme has coped through the downturn will be closely scrutinised, in particular its effectiveness in assisting to modify the effects of future downturns in the farming in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill proposes to amend the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act 1988 to give effect to an initiative for schools announced by the Prime Minister in his February 1992 One Nation statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for an additional $15 million for capital grants for non-government schools for the 1992 calendar year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">STATES GRANTS (TAFE ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Bill 1992 provides for supplementation for 1992 recurrent grants to reflect increases in price levels and also to appropriate funds for the increases for TAFE announced in the Government's November 1991 Statement on the Economy and Employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill gives effect to the Government's decision announced in the November Statement to provide an additional $115m for post-secondary education in 1992. This is the initial stage of the response to overcoming the problems highlighted in the Finn Report on Post-compulsory Education and Training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst the proportion of young people remaining to the end of secondary school has virtually doubled in a decade, and student numbers at our universities have risen by over 50%, this is not the case for TAFE. While student demand for TAFE and training has continued to increase strongly there has not been the growth experienced in the other sectors. The budgetary priorities of State Governments, who have responsibility in this area, together with labour market conditions have limited training opportunities in the TAFE sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Discussions between the States and the Commonwealth the funding issues raised by the Finn Report are still in progress but this funding initiative, when taken together with other funding initiatives announced in the Prime Ministers "One Nation" statement, will contribute markedly towards setting funding for vocational education and training on a proper basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth is extending its original offer to the States and Territories on TAFE funding and is offering to take full funding responsibility for the development of a new and expanded system  of institutes of vocational education. In the context of this offer, the Commonwealth will provide an additional $720m over the 1993-1995 triennium to fund growth in the system. However, this Bill is confined to additional 1992 funding and further legislation will be introduced in the Budget Session.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of the changes is that the Bill provides for an additional $98.904m in recurrent funding and an additional $3.490m in capital funding taking the total funds available in 1992 to $475.307m.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. The Act provides Commonwealth grants of financial assistance to the States, the Northern Territory and higher education institutions for the provision of higher education. This Bill provides increased funding for higher education institutions of $46.7 million in 1992, $29.7 million in 1993 and $9.5 million in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with the Government's cost supplementation arrangements, the Bill provides for additional funds over the 1992 to 1994 triennium to take account of movements in the Department of Employment, Education and Training's higher education salary and non-salary indexes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also gives effect to Government decisions on higher education announced in the former Prime Minister's November 1991 statement on the economy and employment and in the Prime Minister's February 1992 economic statement. The Bill provides an extra $38.4 million in 1992, $21.5 million in 1993 and $15.7 million in 1994 for additional student places and for higher education capital works.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also provides for a technical adjustment of funds payable to institutions between operating grants and amounts payable via the Higher Education Trust Fund in respect of HECS student liabilities. The variations reflect an on-going adjustment to the level of funds available through the Trust Fund as estimates are adjusted to take account of actual student numbers. These adjustments do not affect the total level of funding available to the higher education system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we adjourned this discussion some weeks ago, we were considering questions relating to the ADCNET program, the Australian diplomatic corps network program of computer procurement by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Committee of the Whole will recall that there have been a number of questions raised about the tender process. The question principally that I was concerned with, both in the Estimates Committee and in the Committee of the Whole, was whether or not the awarding of the contract to HP was done in a manner to effectively exclude products from an Australian company, Labtam, in respect of terminals for the ADCNET program. The Government has recognised the need for departments to ensure, so far as is possible, that Australian and New Zealand goods and services are given a fair go. The tender document stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has directed Commonwealth agencies not to draw up purchasing specifications (including technical, performance and delivery requirements) so as to exclude A/NZ products which are suitable, or reasonably adaptable, to Commonwealth needs, or to evaluate offers in a manner which is biased against Australian and New Zealand suppliers.</PARA>
<PARA>The structure of the tendering process in this instance was considered by the Department to require a company that was tendering for the project to give the total solution. Because of that, the principal tenderers were all foreign owned companies. So far as Labtam was concerned, it was required to offer its terminals through Hewlett-Packard which, so far as the terminals were concerned, was one of its principal competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Questions relating to that matter proceeded between the Department and me at Estimates committee hearings where I indicated, when discussion was foreclosed on this matter, that there would be a number of questions that I would want answered. I am grateful to the Department for addressing this particular matter in the detail which it has. I am not satisfied with the responses in a policy sense. I am not suggesting that there is any bias on the part of the Department whatsoever. I feel, however, that there is an inherent bias in the structure of the tendering process. We have a situation where an Australian firm, under this particular tendering process, was required to go through a competitor to have its terminals considered by those who were authorised by the Department to consider the network as a whole. It is impossible, in the Committee of the Whole, to go into the details of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the Australian producer of terminals is concerned, it has been recognised by many people, both here in Australia and internationally, that its terminals rank amongst the best in the world. It is impossible to take forward these matters of the detailed considerations of the Department's responses in the Committee of the Whole. I understand that Labtam has put this matter before the Commonwealth Ombudsman and presumably that is where the matter can be considered in detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate the fact that the Department has addressed this issue and is taking extremely seriously the questions that I raised on the matter. However, it is still my view that consideration should be given to the tendering process to ensure that Australian manufacturers feel confident that their products can be taken on their merits and that they do not have to go through a competitor for the purposes of having their products considered for inclusion in such a major networking system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Public Accounts Committee, when it did an investigation into the business migration program, was very critical of that program and the way in which it was administered, pointing out that on many occasions it was used as a scam whereby people would bring money in. There was no proof or check that the money would actually stay here; it could be moved out. Indeed, the scheme has subsequently been abandoned and a new one introduced.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With the utmost respect, Mr Chairman, that is an immigration matter. It has nothing whatsoever to do with Foreign Affairs. It must be the case that our relations with Taiwan, as a matter that is properly the subject of discussion under Estimates Committee B, are to do with Foreign Affairs' relationship with Taiwan.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the light of that question, of course, we have on the record the fact that the then Minister, Senator Richardson, five years ago exercised directly influence in a ministerial area that was not his. Then, on 18 March this year, there was another immigration request concerning Mr Symons, Senator Richardson's good friend, who was trying to get a Taiwanese national, who was the son of an investor, into Australia. Of course, he was to come into Australia as a consultant. That well known company Multiplex in fact wrote and said that it wanted this particular Taiwanese person to come into Australia. As our only representation in Taiwan is a commercial one and it has to be dealt with by another post&mdash;and that post, of course, is the responsibility of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&mdash;I wonder whether the Minister could tell me what records he has in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade relating to this particular matter on or about 18 March this year.</PARA></TALK.START>

It might be helpful if I took this opportunity to read those questions and answers into the record, because they probably do address the series of questions that Senator Bishop has in mind here. I am reading the relevant part from Mr Kerin's letter of 26 May which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Point by point, you asked:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Did Austrade provide any market advice or information to Mr Symons about business migration schemes in general or particularly about interest in such schemes in Hong Kong and Taiwan?'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Austrade informs me that it has no record or memory of providing any such advice to Mr Symons either in Australia or overseas.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Did Austrade provide Mr Symons with contacts, introductions or other in-market services in Hong Kong and Taiwan (through the Australian Chamber of Commerce in Taipei)?'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Austrade informs me that its Hong Kong office holds no correspondence or records relating to Mr Symons nor has any recollection of contact. The office further notes that any matters concerning business migration would normally be handled by the Immigration Section of the Consulate, rather than by Austrade. The Australian Commerce and Industry Office in Taipei has informed Austrade that it has had no contact with Mr Symons including through its Visa Service director who would be the most likely point of contact on business migration matters.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Was Austrade provided with briefing on the matter by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, particularly in relation to Senator Kerry Sibraa's approach to the Australian Embassy in Washington for assistance for Mr Symons?'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Austrade informs me that neither it nor DFAT has any record or memory of briefings on this issue being provided to Austrade including by the Embassy in Washington.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Was there any correspondence between Senator Richardson and the Australian Trade Commissioner in Hong Kong concerning Mr Symons' scheme?'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Austrade informs me that a check of the files in the Hong Kong Office through its correspondence tracker has not located any correspondence related to Senator Richardson or Mr Symons.</PARA>
<PARA>That pretty well exhausts the range of matters that Senator Bishop seems to be concerned with. My point stands that DFAT has no direct involvement in this. Austrade does have a potentially marginal involvement through its Hong Kong office, but in the particular context of the matter with which Senator Bishop is concerned, the answers are as I have just relayed them. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Andrew</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems sensible to address in writing some of the issues raised by you about the Export Market Development Scheme (EMDG) over the past few weeks, and in particular to address the specific points raised in your press release of 20 May about the EMDG and questions relating to Austrade's broader involvement with Mr Symons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Point by point, you asked;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Did Austrade provide any marked advice or information to Mr Symons about business migration schemes in general or particularly about interest in such schemes in Hong Kong and Taiwan?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Austrade informs me that it has no record or memory of providing any such advice to Mr Symons either in Australia or overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Did Austrade provide Mr Symons with contacts, introductions or other in-marked services in Hong Kong or Taiwan (through the Australian Chamber of Commerce in Taipei)?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Austrade informs me that its Hong Kong office holds no correspondence or records relating to Mr Symons nor has any recollection of contact. The office further notes that any matters concerning business migration would normally be handled by the Immigration Section of the Consulate, rather than by Austrade. The Australian Commerce and Industry Office in Taipei has informed Austrade that it has had no contact with Mr Symons including through its Visa Service director who would be the most likely point of contact on business migration matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Was Austrade provided with briefing on the matter by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, particularly in relation to Senator Kerry Sibraa's approach to the Australian Embassy in Washington for assistance for Mr Symons?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Austrade informs me that neither it nor DFAT has any record or memory of briefings on this issue being provided to Austrade including by the Embassy in Washington.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Was there any correspondence between Senator Richardson and the Australian Trade Commissioner in Hong Kong concerning Mr Symons' scheme?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Austrade informs me that a check of the files in the Hong Kong Office through its correspondence tracker has not located any correspondence related to Senator Richardson or Mr Symons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Was Austrade also directed by the Prime Minister to search its files for any information relevant to the Symons Affair? If not, why not?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Austrade was asked by my Office to look for information relevant to the Symons affair, as well as being prompted by your press releases and Freedom of Information requests to conduct a search on its own behalf. A direct request from the Prime Minister was therefore unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"What other companies involved in the Marshall Islands technology park and educational scheme also received EMDG grants related to the project?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This question appears to be based on a misunderstanding on your part, in that Austrade has already made clear that neither Mr Symons nor Feedtech Pty. Ltd. has received EMDG monies related to that project. Austrade informs me that it has no record of an EMDG being awarded which is in any way related to this project in the Marshall Islands.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having answered the specific points raised in your press release, let me now address a more general issue relating to the EMDG Scheme with which the coalition parties seem to be having some difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The EMDG scheme provides taxable cash grants based on eligible export development expenditure already incurred: ie. quantitative and evidentiary rather than qualitative and discretionary criteria are the basis for payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those quantitative criteria are rigorously applied to EMDG applications by Austrade's Investigation Officers in much the same way a tax return is assessed by the Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because the criteria are quantitative rather that qualitative there is no margin of improper external influence. Eligibility criteria are either met or they are not: end of story. This also ensures that the scheme can be administered efficiently and effectively at a cost of about 1.3 per cent of grant funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust I have gone some way towards correcting the confusion which seems to prevail in Opposition discussion of this issue&mdash;confusion which I might add did not seem so prevalent in the Opposition's support for the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No2) which followed a thoroughgoing review of the EMDG Scheme and was enacted in December 1990 after debate in both Houses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your colleague, Mr Ian McLachlan, the Member for Barker, in speaking to the EMDG Bill, referred to it as `a piece of quite complex legislation enacting complex changes to a scheme which involves a plethora of eligibility criteria, rules and definitions.' (Hansard, 14/11/90)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In your press release of 19 May 1992, only 18 months later, you refer to your `call for a review and tightening of the eligibility criteria for Export Market Development Grant EMDG) awards.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition supported that legislation. It had no concerns about the eligibility criteria being loose or unsatisfactory at that time&mdash;in fact, based on the Member for Barker's comments, it is reasonable to assume that at least some in the Coalition found the eligibility criteria too stringent and restrictive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your recent `call for a review and tightening of eligibility criteria' sits a little awkwardly with this position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In light of this, the deep concern your comments have aroused among the many Australian businesses who benefit from the EMDG Scheme is an unnecessary and disturbing development. I am sure you are aware of this, as many of the letters I have received on this matter over recent days have also been copied to your Office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All are concerned that the `review' you are calling for will limit the effectiveness and efficiency of a scheme that they value very highly. One writer even claimed that he had information that the scheme was going to cease operation as of July 1 this year. As you know, these fears are totally unfounded and are based upon your campaign which is largely politically motivated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I seek your cooperation in quelling these fears and enabling the companies involved to concentrate on what they do best developing export markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A clear statement for you reaffirming the Coalition's support for the EMDG Scheme and indicating any further Coalition policy intentions in this area would be one way for you to inform all those concerned about where they stand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would be especially valuable to our exporters in light of your comment that `The Opposition has promised to put a broom through Austrade' press Release, l9/5/92) and in light of the Fightback! proposal to reduce funding to Austrade by $70m over two years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I look forward to your cooperation in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have also enclosed two background papers on the EMDG Scheme in general and the Scheme as it was applied to Mr Symons for your information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Due to public interest in this matter I will make my reply to you available to the media.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first item on the running sheet is Appropriation Bill No. 5. It is dealt with on page 5 of the report of Senate Estimates Committee B. It is also dealt with, I think, in the reservation. More particularly, it was the subject of a considerable amount of discussion during the hearings of Estimates B and that is why it is specifically mentioned on page 5 of the Committee's report to the Senate. The report reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee questioned the unusual precedent of introducing an additional appropriation bill which combined elements from appropriation bills already before Parliament with an additional amount of funds.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee B report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department advised that alternative measures to introducing an additional appropriation bill, such as using the Advance to the Minister for Finance or not fulfilling contractual obligations, were considered. It was proposed that the AMF would have been placed under considerable pressure if requests from the three programs involved were received simultaneously, as was anticipated and, together with Parliament's expressed opinions on the use of the AMF, the view was adopted that it was preferable to be specific so that Parliament knew exactly the purpose of the appropriation.</PARA>
<PARA>That part of the Committee's report was based on the assertion by the Department and by the Government, through Senator McMullan, that there were contractual obligations that required payments to be made during the April and May period of this quarter for child-care relief and one or two other purposes. So the whole of the Government's approach and the whole rationale&mdash;the whole underpinning&mdash;for the extraordinary, unprecedented action that was taken in the introduction of Appropriation Bill (No. 5) was that there were contractual obligations that had to be fulfilled.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one reads the Senate Estimates Committee transcript, one would see that the essential reason that Senator McMullan gave was that there were contractual obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first question, given that papers were subsequently tabled and provided to the Estimates Committee&mdash;none of which, on my understanding, comprises anything remotely resembling a contract or a contractual arrangement&mdash;was why did Senator McMullan place so much weight on the contractual arrangement argument when, in fact, there are no contracts that have been provided to the Senate to verify the claim that he made. </PARA>

Even if it were said only once, there would still be a question as to why it was said. It remains my advice&mdash;not a matter of my personal knowledge or expertise&mdash;that under the two headings relating to urgency, that is, contractual obligations or normal expectations of people with regard to regular payments on which they may be relying, there are payments which arise relating to Appropriation Bill (No. 5).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The basic legal background to the question of contractual commitments is contained in the relevant Acts and agreements signed between the Government or its agencies and the clients. Job-training, child-care relief and residential elderly care are three programs that were the subject matter of Appropriation Bill (No. 5).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me draw Senator McMullan's attention to what I think we both agree are the more legal documents. In each document there is the term `the Minister may provide funds' under a  certain payments schedule. In other documents it says that `subject to the availability of funds' the payments will be made, and so on. The handbooks issued in relation to some of these programs&mdash;I am looking at the child-care relief handbook&mdash;and the associated guidelines seem to go beyond the Act and the agreements that have been undertaken as a result of the Act. But the legal underpinning of the handbooks, the guidelines and the agreements must be the Act of Parliament. The Act of Parliament does not, on my reading, contain a mandatory provision for the payments in the time period that the Government said was required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to this point because I think it is of fundamental importance, given that the Government took an unprecedented action in introducing a new Appropriation Bill which amended two Appropriation Bills it had brought before the Parliament just four weeks earlier.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short raises an important question. I think anyone listening would probably find it very arcane and detailed and obscure. Nevertheless, I recognise that there is an important underlying principle about accountability. Because I regard this as an important matter, I will check and get a written response to Senator Short if there is anything to add. My understanding is that the legislation authorises the Minister to enter into contracts and, once a contract is entered into, authorised by legislation&mdash;although the details of it may not be specified in the legislation&mdash;the contract is binding on the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>

If there is information to be provided over and above that which I have given, I will provide it to Senator Short.

They may be authorised by the Act to do things beyond the Act, but they cannot do things which are not authorised by the Act. I will check on those things. If there is a problem, apart from advising Senator Short, I will draw it to the attention of the responsible Minister. My understanding at the moment is that the Department of Finance is satisfied that these things are being done in accordance with the law and that the appropriations were warranted, according to the criteria I outlined before. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listeners to this discussion might think it is arcane and obscure. I do not think it is, and I am glad to see that Senator McMullan recognises the importance of the subject. What we are talking about here goes to the whole core of proper financial administration and management. It goes not just to the legality of it&mdash;that in itself is surely a matter of great significance&mdash;but as well to the Government's administration and its competence in managing its program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 26 or 27 February the Government introduced two Bills&mdash;Appropriation Bills No. 3 and No. 4&mdash;in the normal due process of additional estimates and additional appropriations. That is proper, accepted practice. It did it on the basis of its best understanding of its financial, revenue and expenditure requirements until the end of the financial year. That is the way things are normally done. Within four weeks of having done that, the Government said that it was forced to come into this Parliament and say, `We got it wrong only four weeks ago. Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4 do not really do the trick. We got that wrong. We have to amend them before they have even been considered properly by the Parliament, and we have to introduce another Bill'. Apart from the legalities we have been talking about, that smacks of gross financial incompetence. It is a point the Government is bound to respond to because it is typical of what appears to be happening at the moment in the financial administration of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two weeks ago the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, admitted that there was now going to be a Budget deficit for this year of $9.3 billion, when only three or four weeks earlier&mdash;despite the discussion, which Senator McMullan will recall, that we had in Estimates Committee B about the forecasts and the Budget estimates&mdash;the Government had been sticking very dogmatically to its forecast deficit for the year of $6.8 billion. Within three weeks it was forced to make an admission that it was $2 1/2 billion out. Even that $6.8 billion, which was announced in the economic statement of 26 February, was a further blow-out of an estimate that had been given as pretty firm by the new Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, in January, just a month earlier, that the deficit for this year was going to be $5.3 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That one in turn was a forced admission from him, after severe questioning by the Opposition and every economic commentator in Australia who follows these matters, that the original Budget estimate of $4.7 billion was not going to be achieved. That was the Budget estimate last August. It has now had three revisions: in January to $5.3 billion; in February to $6.8 billion; and on 11 May to $9.3 billion. Heaven only knows how accurate that figure is going to be. That wrong forecasting, and the Government's admissions that it was wrong, smack of financial incompetence of the highest order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am putting to Senator McMullan is that the response the Government has made, following us raising this question of the need for Appropriation Bill No. 5, simply confirms the view of the Opposition, and, I am sure, of the wider community, that the Government has lost control of and cannot forecast its financial situation, which has enormous impacts right across the financial markets, right across business, right across the whole scope of the economy. Now Senator McMullan has come into the Senate and said, `I'll have another look at it'. I put it to him frankly that that is not good enough. He should have had all those answers weeks ago. This was due to be debated two or three weeks ago, and still he does not have the answers he should have had then, if not in the Estimates Committee when this was raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask another question in relation to that. Senator McMullan raised and put great weight on the contractual obligation side of the matter as a justification for Appropriation Bill (No. 5). Therefore, could I ask why, when the Minister for Finance introduced Appropriation Bill (No. 5) in the House of Representatives, he did not mention contractual obligations as one reason for the Bill?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two points within all that windy rhetoric. One is that the deficit is larger than was predicted.

We will not advance the expeditious handling of Estimates by me entering into it, other than to confirm the views which they have expressed. So let us get on with the question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we were bogged down in a bit of detail about contracts is that Senator Short raised what was to me a new question, to which I was trying to respond, concerning the obligations which were entered into being beyond the power of the relevant authorising legislation. To the best of my knowledge, that question has not been raised before&mdash;certainly not according to the material that I have before me at the moment. If it were true, it would be an important point and therefore I undertook to pursue it. I did not have the answer because the honourable senator was raising something with me which had not been raised before. This is not actually directly relevant to the Department of Finance. However, it does relate to this appropriation and I am happy to pursue it. As the honourable senator would know, the legislation and the contracts to which he is referring would actually be the responsibility of other departments. Rather than hide behind that, let us pursue it and see whether it is accurate because if it is accurate, it is important. </PARA>

It would have been irresponsible not to do so, and that is why we did it. That should be put on the record. This point has not come up today because we have been pursuing the legislative underpinning of the Bill. But, fundamentally, without it unnecessary and unwarranted hardship would have been caused. Therefore, we introduced the Bill and it would have been irresponsible not to have done so. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What it boils down to is that, had the Government got its act right so far as its financial forecasting, administration and management were concerned, all of this would have been avoided. Appropriation Bills (No. 3) and (No. 4) would have provided the necessary amounts, unless there were contractual obligations which made that impossible because of the time involved in Senate and other consideration of the Bills. As I say, the necessary supporting evidence has not been presented to the Senate to say that those legal obligations were there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that as a background, I point out that on 30 March Senator McMullan claimed that almost all the amounts were due and payable on 1 April, which was only two days later. I think that was in relation to child-care. Yet, in fact payments could not be made, as I understand it, for at least seven to 10 days later, based on the time needed to obtain royal assent and other due process. That seems to me to mean either that the pressing need was not as pressing, or that it was going to be met from other sources. </PARA>

It is absurd to suggest that the role of the Department of Finance with regard to a government proposal would be the same as its analysis with regard to any other. For example, all the expenditure proposals in One Nation are subject to continuing analysis by the Department of Finance like any other Government expenditure proposal, as Senator Short well knows.

He may recall that the Department of Finance officers advised us that they were dependent on the use of the model that had been built by Treasury officers and that they had a standing brief to give ministerial advice on matters which may be of budgetary significance. Therefore the Opposition policy was examined by Department of Finance officers as well as by Treasury officers. We were very concerned to see whether there had been even-handedness by the Department or whether there had been a political bias.

The situation is that I am quite happy to cooperate but Senator Short asked leave to conclude dealing with that section so that we could deal with extra matters that Senator Bishop wished to raise. I was happy to cooperate, and so we stopped dealing with this section and went on. I am simply saying that that is the point at which we stopped. Senator Short asked the question. I said then, as I think I said to the Estimates Committee&mdash;I do not think I added anything extra but perhaps I did&mdash;that of course One Nation was analysed by the Department of Finance, as all government expenditure proposals are analysed by the Department of Finance, and the Government's costings based on that advice, amongst others, were made public and have been subjected to scrutiny by independent commentators since that time.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator McMullan stood there and purported to tell us that on the advice of the people in the box next to him the treatment of the two statements was the same, except for a `minor refinement'&mdash;that was the first phrase&mdash;and `a slight alteration' which was, I think, the second phrase. The fundamental point that I want to have on the record is that the advisers sitting in the box have not the faintest idea whether the parameters, the equations&mdash;or anything else in the model&mdash;were changed for the purposes of treating the Fightback package and treating the One Nation statement. Yes, we can quite accurately determine that when we come to Treasury. But at the moment, as I said, it is wrong for Senator McMullan to try to say that there was no difference, when he simply has no knowledge of it and when the advice that is conveyed to him is such that he can answer, `I do not know'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the matters which I and other senators are particularly concerned with is the independence of the Audit Office. The whole thrust of the Public Accounts Committee report entitled, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament</EMPHASIS>, was to ensure that the Auditor-General was independent, and could fulfil his fundamental task of being the link between the administration of government policy and the Parliament. In other words, his task is to see that taxpayers' money is properly spent, and accountable to the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From time to time we find many areas where we are indeed concerned at the way in which the Executive tries to fetter that independence and, indeed, to limit his mandate. We expressed in that report concern that there should be an audit committee of the Parliament established which would break the power that the Executive presently has to limit the function of the Auditor-General by limiting the financial resources made available to him. The Committee report was very strong on the point that an audit committee could break that nexus and make the Auditor-General truly independent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of mandate, we were drawing attention, in respect of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, to the fact that the question of mandate should be fully recognised. That means that the auditor for government business enterprises, as well as government departments and other agencies, should always be the Auditor-General. He has the power to use the private sector by way of contract. That is being done, and most successfully done, but at the end of the day it is the Auditor-General who is the auditor for that enterprise. At every stage we are concerned about making the Auditor-General truly independent and truly appear to be independent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, something has come to my attention which worries me greatly. I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) to tell me whether it is true. I understand that the Australian Labor Party is building a new building opposite the National Press Club here in Canberra, and that the major tenant of the Australian Labor Party will be the Australian National Audit Office. If that is true, it is a scandal. I would ask, right at the beginning: is it in fact true that it has been negotiated that in this building, on which the Australian Labor Party cannot be spending less than some $80m&mdash;and I would love to know where the money is coming from, and perhaps that is the real reason for the amendment to the disclosure provisions coming through&mdash;the Australian National Audit Office is to be a tenant of the Australian Labor Party?</PARA>

Let us put that in perspective. It has been the case, I would have thought, probably for 20 years. I may not be correct about that, but it has been a long time and, as far as I know, it is still the case. It is some time since I checked that it certainly has been the case.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I would be very pleased if the Parliamentary Secretary would do so. As I have said, the Public Accounts Committee has been at great strength and at great pains to point out that the Auditor-General must be truly independent. The Auditor-General cannot be seen to be truly independent if he is a tenant of a political party, let alone the political party that is in power and an Executive that tries to limit his function.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Parliamentary Secretary is trying to dispel the importance of this issue by saying it is a conspiracy theory. Let me say on the record that we have plenty of evidence of the way in which this present Government behaves. We have all the evidence of Mr Symons and his affair. We have the evidence of Senator Richardson sitting on the board of 2HD in Newcastle, and sitting at the same time in a Cabinet meeting and deciding the ad bans policy as it applies. That ad bans legislation&mdash;that is, the abolishing of freedom of speech&mdash;makes us all dependent on the way in which a particular radio or television station, or commentators employed by them, portray our policies of the day.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Suggestion that Richo has been ringing members of Cabinet and President seeking leniency.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the line that appears in this particular file note. Notice the status of this document. It is a file note recording a telephone conversation from our Ambassador in Pohnpei, who in turn is reporting what he has heard that day from the Marshall Islands. He has heard official news that people have been arrested&mdash;Australian citizens&mdash;in circumstances that are manifestly of interest to the Department, as these things always are, and he is reporting a rumour that has been circulating that day in Majuro&mdash;a `suggestion that Richardson has been ringing members of Cabinet and President seeking leniency'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ambassador is reporting it on the basis, I am able to further advise the Opposition, of his contact with an Australian official based in Majuro and someone close to the Government. The rumour is one in the terms expressed. The rumour is that what Senator Richardson was doing was ringing not just the President but the President and members of Cabinet&mdash;more than one phone call. The other substantive thing in the rumour is that what was involved was not a mere request for denial of a passport to be overturned to enable him to prepare his defence but, rather, seeking of leniency.

There were not multiple phone calls but one phone call only to the President&mdash;a short phone call in circumstances which are fully described on page 6 of Senator Richardson's report, as well as in other places. There was a short phone call in which Senator Richardson made clear he was holding himself out not as a member of the Australian Government but as a private citizen, doing so on behalf of a family connection, and not seeking leniency, not seeking in any way a reaction to the substantive matters in issue, but simply addressing the question of the passport.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The political situation in Thailand is obviously still very fluid at the moment. The political parties remain deadlocked over the formation of a new government. A new Prime Minister is yet to be named. The constitutional tribunal is expected to meet today, 27 May, to consider the validity of the royal decree which gave amnesty to all parties involved in the violence in Bangkok last week, the handling of which issue is obviously of crucial significance to the whole political future of the country as well as to the reaction of other countries such as Australia. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are hopeful about the prospects for a peaceful solution.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The horror which we all felt as the details of the violence became clear in the course of last week was, I assure the Senate, wholly shared by me. The fact that I did not make public comment about it was simply because I was overseas, badly out of communication in terms of the evolving events, and needed to be fully apprised of the scale of it and the responsibility for it, because of the policy consequences that flowed from that analysis. I say now for the record that I was absolutely appalled by the violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am further appalled by the fact that there is now compelling evidence that a great deal of the death toll was a result of deliberate actions by a number of senior Thai generals. The size of the death toll is still unclear. Latest figures suggest that there are as many as 589 people missing on current compilations and, unhappily, it does seem reasonable to assume that a very large proportion of those&mdash;if not all&mdash;are, in fact, dead.

We now have a copy of the file note that refers to the fax having been sent.

And faxes do go astray; they get misfiled or gathered up and put in the wastepaper basket when they should be routed somewhere else.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The recent publication of the Bureau of Industry Economics industry brief on the services sector of May 1992 makes it clear that the services sector is playing a vital role in providing new jobs in Australia and in contributing to the improvement in Australia's balance of payments. It is a fact that job growth in Australia in the last year has been particularly strong in two&mdash;and I single out two&mdash;of Australia's service industry sectors, in spite of the recession. Those sectors relate to community services and recreational and personal services. In the latter case, the employment growth was 6.4 per cent through the year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recreational services sector is overwhelmingly conducted in the private sector and is weighted towards small business activity. I imagine that Senator Colston has a particular interest in this sector because he is a Queensland senator, and tourism plays a major role in the sector. It makes a significant contribution to Australia's balance of payments. It occurs on both sides of the balance of payments account. Foreign tourists coming in is the equivalent of increased export earnings and Australians holidaying in Australia rather than overseas is import replacement expenditure.</PARA>

Can the Minister advise whether the SLORC, under the new Chairman, General Than Shwe, firstly, is any closer to handing over power to a democratically elected National Assembly; secondly, is any closer to convening a national convention in October this year; thirdly, has released any more political prisoners; fourthly, has honoured the agreement for repatriation of Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh; and, fifthly, has stopped Burmese Army attacks against the Karen National Union forces near the Thai-Burma border? Further, does the Minister have reports about the well being of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi following the recent visit by her husband, Michael Aris? Lastly, if there has not been any significant improvement in these matters by the SLORC, will the Australian Government impose economic sanctions against the Burmese regime?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been a number of recent developments giving some cause for hope that we may be entering a new era but as yet those signs are still few, and far between, insubstantial and incomplete. What has happened is that, firstly, there have been decisions made to convene a meeting of political parties by late next month and a national convention by October. We will have to wait and see whether that happens according to that timetable but that, at least, is a healthy development.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the question of political prisoners, more have been released, with the current total standing at 110. While that is welcome and very much overdue, it has to be said that the pace of release is still extraordinarily sluggish, with possibly 2,000 or more political prisoners still awaiting release.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the repatriation of the Rohingya refugees, that, regrettably, did not commence on 15 May as had been agreed and the suffering of those people continues. We understand that that is due to the failure of the Burmese Government to provide adequate preparations for the safe return of the refugees in question. On the eastern border, the cease-fire between the Burmese Army and the Karen National Union forces does appear to be holding. We remain, however, cautious about the significance of that because, as I have previously stated, the onset of the monsoon could have been the key factor in that particular Burmese decision. As to the condition of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, all I can say is that, as has already been seen from public reporting of a statement recently issued by her husband, she is in good spirits and good health despite almost three years in detention.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely&mdash;for all the reasons I spelt out yesterday. Moreover, the premises of Senator Hill's question are not accurate. The Department, at least the Department here in Canberra, did not have the memorandum from Symons to Richardson that came to light on 15 May. That was in Washington, not here in Canberra, and it came to light only as a consequence of the investigation, the follow-up, which I myself directed occur after the question was raised here on 7 May. The Department did have a copy of Senator Sibraa's letter and some associated material of the kind that we have been talking about. That is true&mdash;on 7 May.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the prospectus and quite a lot of voluminous documentation relating to the Marshall Islands scheme, that was sent down by bag in the week or two after the arrests took place and the consular issue began, and has arrived in more recent days within the Department. I am not sure whether or not that was around at the time. But once one gets involved in a consular matter of this kind, demanding and requiring departmental resources, there is quite a lot of documentation associated with it. But there is nothing in particular to suggest that there was any great significance about any of this until everybody got excited from the latter part of April onwards; and certainly nothing to suggest any involvement of my Department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just mention the fact for the record&mdash;we pulled out these figures in the context of all the anxiety about leaks the other day&mdash;that the Department produces some 180,000 original classified cables each year. Together with the number of copies of each that are prepared and distributed, that results in something like 22 1/2 million new documents a year being produced in relation to cables alone. It is also estimated that my Department produces or receives in Canberra each year in the form of originals and copies over 13 million other classified documents not being cables. From my experience, a fair proportion of that sort of material flows through my office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It just happens to be the case that at any given time there are 100 or 200 significant issues running, all with documentation of one kind or another.

The content of this document did not in any way address the question of possible connection or contact between Symons and any Australian mission in the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) during Question Time, in particular the last question that he answered to Senator Hill.</PARA>
<PARA>This afternoon in Question Time we have not seen theatre, as Senator Evans would wish us to believe, but the debasement of the parliamentary process. Quite frankly, a very simple question remains unanswered in any way, shape or form that can be in any way considered satisfactory. It relates to the question I asked the Minister on 7 May when I rose after Question Time, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, at 3.54 p.m. to take note of his answer. Senator Evans rose at 3.57 p.m. to answer my taking note of the answer and the time on the top of the faxed document is 3.53 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, any staff who did not get that document over to the Minister in this chamber forthwith are not behaving properly. If the Minister says he did not see it until he got back to his office after 4 p.m., he then had a number of hours&mdash;until five minutes past 11 that night&mdash;to come into this chamber and say that this documentation had been received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has offered no explanation at all. He has simply offered in his defence that it was 2 o'clock in the morning in Washington and he could not ring Washington. It was not necessary for him to ring Washington in order for him to inform the Senate that, in fact, the information he had given us during the course of his answer could now be illuminated. He had that knowledge at the same time. It was available to him. He deliberately chose not to come back into the Senate. When Senator Hill said the Minister misled the Senate by omission, he was quite correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning we saw another example of it. During the appropriations debate in the Committee of the Whole we had a little dissertation about a letter written by Mr Kerin to Mr Peacock. The Minister read out parts of the letter and said that I could not have the whole letter because it was private correspondence. Subsequently, I got the letter and discovered that Andrew Peacock had published it. However, the part that the Minister neatly did not care to read out to me during the time he was answering me was the last paragraph of Mr Kerin's letter where he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Due to public interest in this matter, I will make my reply to you available to the media.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Minister had the letter in his hand. He was quoting a letter which he had purported to read yet he said it was not a public letter, it was a private letter between two members of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister sits there and tells us that he did not mislead the Parliament. He sits there and has the hide&mdash;the audacity&mdash;to tell us that he can answer questions put by Senator Schacht about Myanmar with great recall and attention to detail, but as to the running of his own Department, that documentation has been in his Department since 6 April. He now digs up a further document dated 21 April and tells us that not one of his staff has told him anything about it at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister expects us to believe that nobody told him about a note he has handed to us which says `Political connections&mdash;Sibraa letter', and which talks about Graham Richardson and seeking leniency from Cabinet Ministers and the President of another nation. Does he mean to tell me that if somebody had been seeking leniency from the President of Myanmar he would not have been told? Is there something special about the Marshall Islands? Quite frankly, the Minister is not credible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kupa has made a statutory declaration&mdash;and I presume that that is Mr Kupa sitting in the advisers' box. I can only suspect that Mr Kupa made that statutory declaration to look after his own back. If I had been in his position, I would have, too. Quite clearly, the Minister could have come in here and misrepresented his position as he has misrepresented all other things. I would very much like Mr Kupa to tell us whether the Minister asked him to sign this statutory declaration or whether he did it of his own volition. I would be most interested if, in the end, the Minister would allow him to tell us exactly the situation in which he signed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister's credibility on this issue is simply non-existent. Document after document is turning up. It is like extracting teeth. We are getting them one at a time. We are getting document after document which show that he ought to have known. One cannot but draw the conclusion that the Minister did in fact know, because I cannot imagine that he would have incompetent staff around him who did not keep him informed. If he has, he deserves to go for simply not paying attention to his duty as a Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know about the Minister's temper. We have been tempted to put an ashtray on his desk because we understand that that is one of his favourite weapons. I do not know which one got the gash across the eye and had to go to hospital for stitches, but I understand that he was rewarded so he was quiet in the end. So I ask the Minister: how is it that we can believe&mdash;</PARA>

We would be most interested to know what is in those cables. We would also be most interested to know what has been blacked out in this file note. The serious point is that the Minister has tried to tell us, with an amnesia-led defence, that he at no stage was made aware by any of his advisers or anybody in his office that this matter involved a senior Cabinet Minister who was seeking to intervene in the affairs of another nation. I am sorry, but that is not believable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that is most important is that the Minister keeps telling us we cannot have documents because they relate to evidence that may concern the trial in the Marshall Islands. That is a matter for the Marshall Islands. The content of those cables is a matter for us. There is no sub judice rule covering evidence as it applies to another nation. This is Australia and Australians want to know what is in that documentation&mdash;all of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I asked the Minister yesterday to table all the documents as they were first sent to him, he carefully overlooked that part of my supplementary question. Senator Hill has asked for all the documentation to be made available. In the public interest, the interest of the Australian people, we are entitled to see it. To try to say that it is relevant to a trial in a foreign nation and therefore cannot be seen is just not acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister's record is this: he had, by his own words, the opportunity to come back into this chamber on 7 May and tell us that he had received information immediately he left this chamber from his own office on matters that were pertinent and inquired about at great length in this place during that day. He has given no explanation at all as to why he did not do that. The question of whether he wanted to speak to Washington is irrelevant to that point. The point is that the Minister chose to deprive the Senate of information that it was entitled to have. He can say if he likes that he considers that to be satisfactory ministerial behaviour. I do not think the rest of the chamber will agree with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was speaking earlier I asked that we be enlightened by Mr Kupa as to whether he decided that he was going to draw up that statutory declaration to protect his own interests&mdash;and, as I said, if I were him, I would have&mdash;or whether the Minister instructed him to draw up that statutory declaration. I think it is most important that we are informed how that statutory declaration came into existence. The Minister has many questions unanswered. This matter will not disappear. It is a matter that we will pursue until we see all the documentation, until we know the truth of this matter and until we know how far the tentacles of this sordid affair really reach. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to particular questions about the availability of other documents, I made it perfectly clear in answer to Senator Hill yesterday that I was prepared to treat his generalised request for the tabling of documents as equivalent to an FOI request&mdash;that we would tabulate all the material that exists in the various categories which I described yesterday, we would make judgments about its releasability according to FOI criteria and we would release that as expeditiously as we possibly could.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said in Question Time today that I had complete confidence in Mr Kupa's integrity and honesty. I was perfectly prepared to accept his account of what happened at its face value without requiring any statutory declaration.

On the basis of that&mdash;that those opposite are a miserable bunch of cynics&mdash;accordingly, I asked Mr Kupa to prepare a statutory declaration. That was what was done. He has indicated that in the words which I have just mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the prima facie credibility of what he says about not communicating that conversation to me, and my credibility in saying: no, the basic detail of it as he remembered it was not communicated to me, and that is a perfectly credible situation when we remember the facts. Firstly, both he and I were perfectly aware that Mr Symons had been arrested in the Marshall Islands&mdash;this consular news which the Department was passing on was not new. We were aware of it. I had become aware of it in Senator Richardson's conversation with me on Friday, the 3rd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it was not news to me that there was an alleged political connection in this. As a result of my conversation with Senator Richardson, I knew very well that Senator Richardson was, from Friday onwards, intending to ring the President of the Marshall Islands in order to make a representation to him on the particular question of the passport. When this information was communicated to Mr Kupa on the Tuesday, it was not news to him and he knew that it was not news to me, so there was no particular reason for him to go out of his way to communicate it to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt, he would have communicated to me if I had been sitting there, as I normally do, in the next office. But, as I have already said, I was overseas from the previous day until the 12th&mdash;a full week. Given that there was nothing new in any of this, nothing that required any action, nothing that was at odds with our understanding of the situation, it was manifestly the kind of thing that did not require to be communicated to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another consideration, as I tried to explain at Question Time, is that there are invariably one or two other things happening in ministerial offices, particularly one as busy as mine, when things such as this come along.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RMI&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Republic of the Marshall Islands:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;two people arrested</PARA>
<PARA>That is the first point that is made. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;potential for public comment and Pohnpei sensitivity. </PARA>
<PARA>Later on, the actual matter of the arrest is referred to as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">fraudulent business migration scheme likely to be charged with forgery conspiracy.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a letter of intro. from Sen. Richardson tabled in Court.</PARA>
<PARA>The handwriting below that is indistinct because it was added after the primary note. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">suggestion that Richo has been ringing members of Cabinet and the President seeking leniency.</PARA>
<PARA>Already there are at least two fluorescent matters. It is a serious charge involving Australians. There is a potential for public comment. This is the Department telling the Minister's office, the Australian Ambassador is telling the Minister's office through the Department, that there is a potential for public comment and that Senator Richardson is involved in at least two ways: he has been ringing around and his letter of introduction is in court in the Marshall Islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point is that `File 337/4' is `relevant'. That file was tabled yesterday and contains all the matters relating to Senator Sibraa's request for an introduction of Symons to the Australian Embassy in Washington. With regard to that file&mdash;in which reference is made to Kylie Oakes, who is the officer who sends such messages in the Department&mdash;the file note says: `</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">re Symons and Finch&mdash;re US Sibraa etc&mdash;political connections</PARA>
<PARA>Then there are the references at the bottom to which Senator Bishop has referred:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two cables O.PM 1558, O.PM 1557, O.PM 1556 of Friday</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then there are some words with regard to Peter Byrne and some other people. Miles Kupa's name is mentioned again. They are all in this note of the conversation. As I have said, there are some fluorescent matters there which say that this is not just an ordinary matter&mdash;this is not just an ordinary arrest. It is not only a consular matter; it is a matter that involves political connections in Washington, involves the President of the Senate, involves a senior Cabinet Minister and is likely to lead to public comment. The very first thing to be alerted to in the file note is that this matter might blow up into a public controversy in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was communicated to the Minister's office on 6 April&mdash;one month before 7 May when Senator Bishop asked the Minister what he knew about this man Symons. The Minister said&mdash;he cannot have it two ways&mdash;one month later that he had no knowledge. However, when he is giving his defence as to why his officer Mr Kupa, who is advising him here in the chamber, did not, as it is alleged from his statutory declaration, bring it to his attention one month earlier despite these fluorescent references, he says that he did not bring it to his attention because he already knew that on 3 April&mdash;three days before&mdash;Senator Richardson had rung him to ask his advice before he rang the President of the Marshall Islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Senator Evans `understood' the matter. He understood from Senator Richardson's telephone conversation that this was a sensitive matter. It was about business migration, it was about Symons and about people being arrested. He knew the political sensitivities. He therefore uses that knowledge, personally derived from Senator Richardson, as the excuse for why his principal adviser in his own office did not bring this file note of some dynamite or, as I say, fluorescence to his attention. Senator Evans cannot have it both ways. If he claimed that the reason it was not brought to his attention, if it was not, was that he already knew about these things, why did he not give that answer here in the Senate on 7 May when he was asked? He did not give that answer. He gave the answer, `I have no understanding of the matter'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other matter to which I wish to refer. It arises as a result of the lack of credibility of Senator Evans in this whole matter over these last few days. There is no independent evidence that Senator Richardson ever spoke to Senator Evans. No note has been given by Senator Richardson; no note has been given by Senator Evans. There appears to be no witness to this conversation. One possibility is that it never happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this file note is received by the Minister's personal adviser and when it is communicated from our Ambassador in the Marshall Islands&mdash;when it is received by the responsible officer, O'Leary, in the Department&mdash;they do not have any knowledge that three days earlier, so it is alleged, there was a conversation between two senior Cabinet Ministers about the propriety of that Minister, Senator Richardson, ringing the President of the Marshall Islands or other Cabinet Ministers of the Marshall Islands either to ask for leniency in respect of his cousin Symons or to ask that his cousin be able to defend his case by returning to Australia and that his passport be given back. They are the two versions of the story we have received. Originally the story was that there was a request that his passport be given back; now we hear that the rumour is that he was asking for leniency. We still do not know which one of those is true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, I put it clearly that over these last two days, after some maybe 30 questions to the Minister and literally the greater part of three hours of him answering questions, Senator Evans has not been able to give one shred of evidence that there was in fact that conversation and, if there was the conversation, why there was no note of it and, if there was a conversation, why some note or advice was not given to the Department or at least to our Ambassador in the Marshall Islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously it was a matter that was sufficiently important for Senator Richardson to ask the advice of the Foreign Minister about the sensitivities of the Marshall Islands, yet not of sufficient importance in the mind of that Minister to bring it to the attention of our Ambassador and representative who, it was clear, was going to be in for quite a deal of at least consular and possibly public controversy with all of the US connection and so on. There are not only New South Wales senators but also South Australian senators in this chamber. I put it to Senator Evans that most of this chamber has seen his lack of credibility in the answers he has given over the last two days and that he has not satisfactorily addressed these matters. </PARA>

A few matters have arisen from listening to what the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) has had to say and also from having a closer look at the documentation made available yesterday and today. I note that this file note with the deletions in it has a side note that says, `Telephone call from Peter Stanford, 6.4.92'. I then went back to the statutory declaration sworn by Mr Kupa and I found a document which is a fax from the Federated States of Micronesia to Kylie Oakes. It is dated 3 December 1991. It says, `Subject: Australian Consultants to the RMI Government: Request for Assistance'. The opening words are:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Re your fax. . .</PARA>
<PARA>That means that there has been a fax from either Kylie Oakes or from someone within the Department. Where is that fax? The fax continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we have no background on this matter here, nor was it raised with me during my visit to RMI last week.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second paragraph is even more interesting:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We shall try to find out more about Symons and Finch and their mission in Washington, and will let you know when we do.</PARA>
<PARA>If Mr Peter Stanford undertook to make investigations about Washington in December 1991, presumably he followed that up. Where are the results of his investigations and can we have them tabled also? I conclude by saying that the comments made by the Minister as a result of my moving a motion to take note of his answers, in fact, leave more questions unanswered than there were before I began the exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is more documentation we need to see. I would be most interested to hear from Mr Kupa himself, and indeed from Mr O'Leary. I suppose the only way we can do that is to perhaps have the inquiry we first sought, or else&mdash;and we might examine this proposition&mdash;we could move in the Senate that Mr Kupa be heard by the Senate. The Minister has simply said that he had no knowledge at all of this matter when, quite clearly, early on in the piece, as a result of the investigations that Mr Stanford must have done, he must have found out about Senator Sibraa's letter. We have evidence from the Minister that he spoke with another Minister about calling a foreign government and the appropriateness of that, and that he apparently did not even ask his staff what was known about this matter; he did not even bother to inquire. If that is truly the way the Minister conducts his business, he ought to stand down, because that is not proper behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alternative is that, if he did in fact ask, he must have been told and, therefore, he has simply not been telling us the truth when he said that he knew nothing at all. I find it very difficult to believe that a man who prides himself on attention to detail&mdash;right down to the point of writing a book about what a great job he has done&mdash;would not be sufficiently in touch with his staff to be informed about a matter which had all the inklings and alarm bells of a scandal. It had all the alarm bells of improper behaviour; it had all the alarm bells of, `Why the hell does my colleague Senator Richardson want to ring the Marshall Islands to intervene on behalf of a relative-cum-mate?'. </PARA>

That is why I can stand here and say, as others have said, that it is just not credible to believe that the Minister knew nothing&mdash;selective amnesia. Then, on the day when he was finally put to the test and asked whether he would conduct an inquiry, whether he would find out and tell us, he said that there was nothing of substance and that he had no reason to look at that.

They referred to the basic exchange between Canberra and Washington&mdash;not an exchange, but setting out Senator Sibraa's letter. Basically, on 29 November, my Department sent the same material that it had sent to it from Washington that is sent to Pohnpei. That is clearly the case. Senator Bishop can see that that particular fax says there are four pages in it&mdash;this one plus three others. There is a box with the figure `4' in the top right-hand corner.

<PARA>The Senate may recall that I asked a question of Senator Evans about a very gravely disconcerting situation in China where for every 100 boys under the age of two there are only 89 girls. That, in fact, means that there are millions of missing females. That is the direct result of China's one-child family policy. I called that barbaric. I also asked the Minister whether he could explain to the Senate why, and on whose advice, AIDAB currently had a delegation in China for the purpose of increasing Australian aid to that program, either directly or through UNFPA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister did not address the latter part of that question at all. I would like a response to that, and I will deal with that in a moment. But, in his reply, the Minister said that it was very much Senator Harradine's judgment that the Chinese population policy is barbaric. He said that other judgments differ in that respect, including the judgment of Senator Schacht. That is true.  But who is right?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting part of Senator Evans's response is when he says that it is a matter for detailed analysis, debate and argument, not for assertions by me. That is absolutely correct. I have never said anything about the Chinese population control program that has not been able to be backed up by evidence&mdash;contrary to what Senator Schacht has done in his human rights delegation report, in which he repeated certain assertions without checking them and without having the documentation to check them. That documentation was in fact in my office. It was not provided to him by the Minister's Department or, in that particular case, by the individual, Dr Hull, who was contracted to brief the human rights delegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht repeatedly phoned AIDAB, trying to get it to send a mission to China. Senator Schacht is the one who has been doing that. I do not know whether the Minister has known that, but that has been the situation.

Those were the words used by the Minister in his answer to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to the Minister to look at the documented evidence and not rely upon the Hull document, which was contracted not by his Department but by AIDAB. I did some research on it but, not satisfied with that, I thought it was important to get a full response to the Hull document, and I have that response in my hand. It is from a China specialist in the United States, a former senior research specialist on China in the US Bureau of Census, Dr John S. Aird. He is an author, a person who has detailed knowledge of the situation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposing arguments on the question of whether the Chinese family planning program is coercive do not really start from a common body of evidence. Critics of the program document their charges; defenders avoid coming to grips with the concrete evidence. Many defenders of the Chinese program, including family planners and some demographers, have value conflicts and conflicts of interest in the matter. Most have accepted the "population crisis" idea as established fact, even though it has been seriously challenged on the grounds that it is simplistic and unproven. Family planners want to identify with the evident success of the Chinese program. Some demographers are afraid to criticise it lest they lose their access to Chinese population data, research opportunities, and contacts with Chinese colleagues. Because of the resulting biases, the case put by defenders of the Chinese program is seriously flawed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hull report tries to redefine "coercion" as narrowly as possible to dispel the coercion charge without meeting it head on. It accepts the Chinese cover story that coercion occurs only as a local deviation from government policy and is stopped whenever it is detected. But it ignores substantial evidence that coercion is encouraged from the top and that some forms of coercion have been openly commended by the central authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report argues that the adoption of a new round of provincial family planning laws since 1985 represents an attempt by the authorities to establish a "rule of law" that would prevent the local cadres from resorting to coercive measures. But the laws themselves contain no prohibitions against coercive tactics, nor have the Chinese authorities come up with a specific case of a cadre being punished for using coercion in family planning work. Besides, the domestic media make it perfectly clear that the purpose of the new laws is to tighten, not loosen, the pressures for compliance with family planning demands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hull follows Greenhalgh's lead in insisting that enforcement of family planning policies is becoming more lax because of changes in other aspects of domestic policy, including economic reforms. Both assume that family planning policies cannot be tightened if other aspects of policy are becoming more relaxed. However, the descriptive evidence suggests that the trend in family planning policy has been to tighten control since 1985, and the statistical evidence shows that numbers of family planning surgeries have risen since 1985 and that the total fertility rate, which had rebounded in 1986 and 1987, fell again in 1988, 1989, and 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hull argues that Australian support for the Chinese program will eventually moderate its extreme aspects, but that does not seem to have happened as a result of the United Nations Population Fund involvement that began in 1979 or the International Planned Parenthood Federation involvement that began in 1983. Neither organisation was in a position to exercise a moderating influence in view of their unstinting praise of the program and their unwillingness to recognise its coercive aspects, which the Chinese authorities have correctly interpreted as approval for the program as a whole. Despite their major financial and technical contributions, neither organisation seems to have any real leverage over the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pervasive euphemisms, misstatements of fact, inaccuracies in interpretation, and misrepresentations of the positions of opponents bias the Hull report in favour of the Chinese program.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some time now, as honourable senators will recall, ministerial and departmental responses to my questions on human rights violations inherent in the PRC's population control program have intrigued me by their mixture of evasiveness and dogmatism. I became concerned about this when it emerged that the Australian human rights delegation to China was so poorly briefed that it was unable to challenge the assurances of Sichuan Province family planning officials, which were then simply repeated in the delegation's report to Parliament. The delegation was not even provided with a copy of this Province's draconian family planning regulations at its briefing prior to departure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade appears to have surrendered its human rights surveillance role in the population control area to AIDAB, which had contracted Dr Terry Hull to write a report on China's population control policies with particular emphasis on what he says are the controversial issues of social pressure and coercion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of detailed information held in my office, I considered the Hull report to be less than helpful in the search for truth and an obvious promotion of the interests of the international population control bureaucracies such as UNFPA and IPPF. The action of UNFPA in allocating $US57m to the PRC Government's population control program just three days after the Tiananmen Square massacre still rankles. My concern was heightened when it became clear that the Minister was prepared to accept Dr Hull's report as a basis for Government policy and refused my request that AIDAB publish a more balanced and objective study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since it appears that there is a growing intolerance amounting almost to censorship of the views of those who would challenge the assertions upon which the current Government policy is based, I considered it necessary in the public interest to seek a scholarly response which even the ideologically blinkered might not ignore. The tabled document is that response. I challenge the Minister, his Department and AIDAB to ensure its distribution to those who have or will receive the whole report from AIDAB. I should like the Minister to tell the Senate why the delegation is in China and on whose advice that delegation is there at this moment. </PARA>

In preparing the agenda and itinerary for that delegation's visit, it was quite clear from all the members of the delegation that we wished to deal with the human rights aspects of the Chinese family planning program and population policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, we spent two days in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, having extensive discussions with the officials responsible for running the family planning policy in that province, both at the senior level in the capital and in a village in the nearby rural area, where we talked with people who at a local level carry the policy through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say to Senator Harradine that, until one actually visits China and gets some perspective of what a country with 1,100 million to 1,200 million people looks and feels like, it is a little hard to moralise back here in Australia on all aspects of their family planning program. For example, 110 million people live in Sichuan Province, the area of which is probably not much greater than the total area of Tasmania, a State in Australia that has half a million people. If Senator Harradine can imagine 110 million people living in Tasmania and what that would do to the quality of life in every sense of the word, he will start to get a concept of the Chinese obsession with family planning and living standards for their people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the questions we put to China's planning officials&mdash;and it is in our report&mdash;they made no bones about the fact that one of their major problems is female infanticide. They openly gave us the figures, which showed that in the previous year in Sichuan province, for every 107 boys registered at birth, only 100 girls were registered. So there was a disparity in that year. According to their figures, it was about seven. Clearly, by any demographer's analysis, that means that there is an imbalance. The figures should be much closer. As I understand it, the normal imbalance between male and female births is one or two&mdash;for example, between 100 and 101, or 100 and 102. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The planning officials openly admitted without hesitation the problem of female infanticide, particularly in rural and remote rural areas. They also openly admitted the problem of having to rely on abortion as a contraception means. They admitted that three years ago the number of registered births in the province was about two million and the number of abortions 600,000. They pointed out that, two years later, for two million births they had about 300,000 or 400,000 abortions&mdash;again a very high figure which under no circumstances were they happy with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was clear to us from talking to the officials and to the local people that the high incidence of abortion is a result of not having the facilities in the family planning process to provide decent mechanical contraceptive devices to all the population. This became clear when we went to the villages. The officials openly admitted that not everybody has access to condoms, the pill or IUDs and that, as a result, when women become pregnant there is pressure put on them to have an abortion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The officials admitted that people traditionally would rather have a son than a daughter. That puts female babies at risk of being killed. We raised a specific question that was raised by Senator Harradine and by the then Senator Olsen in a Senate Estimates committee hearing a couple of years ago: whether ultrasonic equipment provided by an Australian aid program was being used to determine the sex of children so that female foetuses could be aborted. The officials said that it was illegal under Chinese law. They do not want people to know the sex of the baby because they do not want an abortion to be carried out. They admitted that they have difficulty in stopping it occurring, that bribery takes place and so on, but that is the law they work under. It is an offence for a doctor or a medical official to give information to parents about the sex of the foetus. But they admitted that there are many gaps and difficulties in the historical culture of China&mdash;which favours male births&mdash;which make it difficult for all of this to be carried through. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not the only place. I know that Senator Harradine has had a long interest in this issue. He has raised interminable questions. He thinks that there is some sort of conspiracy in AIDAB or amongst the academics in Australia to somehow favour this dreadful program in China or elsewhere in the world. My view, and the view of the delegation, is that the issue that we should be looking at in terms of family planning in China is assistance in the area of women's health, because the contraceptive devices being made available to Chinese women put their health at risk. I have to say, after seeing some of the locally made IUDs that are provided, that they look more like a torture weapon to me than a contraceptive device. But they are all that they have available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hope that in any family planning program in which we can assist China we can provide better information, technical facilities and devices so that women's health is not so adversely affected. One of the problems China has at the moment is the high number of abortions. If we provide better contraceptive devices and better educational information, in my view there will be far fewer abortions, and I am sure that would be in line with Senator Harradine's wishes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make no bones about the fact that since my return to Australia last year I have asked a number of questions of the relevant Estimates committee about pushing AIDAB to take a higher profile on family planning matters. I have asked questions about the need for us to substantially increase the funding under Australia's bilateral and multilateral aid programs to provide information and assistance to family planning programs in developing countries, programs that are not coercive but that are educational and supportive and, above all else, that give the women in the Third World, the developing world, the same right of choice as women in Australia have. That is the fundamental issue that should be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, Senator Harradine's remarks and the issues he raises seem to indicate that he is less concerned about the health of women in the Third World than he is about the issue of abortion or coercion. The issue of coercion is important, and we should do everything we can to say to people that family planning has to be voluntary; that it has to be consensorial. If Senator Harradine can imagine 110 million people living in an area the size of Tasmania, then he will start having to make the judgment that he does not have many options about what he can do in regard to family planning and the size of the population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chinese make it quite clear. They say, `If we do not adopt a very severe family planning policy, if you want us not to worry about it, what are you and the rest of the world going to do in the year 2020 or 2015, when there are two billion Chinese people living in the same area? Will you take 150 million people into Australia?'. It is a very good question to ask all of us who wish to moralise about their draconian policy. They have certainly put the shoe on the other foot. Would we take millions or tens of millions of Chinese immigrants to relieve the strain and pressure of the population on their country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chinese say, `If you want a stable China, a country that has a future, where people can live with an expectation of an improved living standard, there has to be some sort of population policy whereby the country's economic growth can provide an increased living standard for the population. But if there is a population growth rate of 3 per cent or 4 per cent, the economic growth rates of China will not only be unable to provide an increased standard of living; they will not even be able to maintain the present standard of living, and the country will descend into economic chaos as more and more people fight over fewer and fewer resources'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the fundamental issues that the Chinese Government is trying to come to terms with&mdash;a Government which I will criticise and have criticised on human rights issues across the board. As the Chinese reminded us endlessly, there is a human right in China: it is the right to exist. Senator Bourne heard that endlessly when we raised political, human and social rights. The only right is the right to exist. If there is no stability in China, there will be chaos and a lot of people will die of starvation or as a result of inadequate health and social services. </PARA>

<PARA>This is a matter of importance that relates to a question asked yesterday regarding the Marshall Islands affair. A search of the bankruptcy registry in New South Wales yesterday failed to disclose documents relating to Mr Symons's insolvency which should have been on the file and available for public scrutiny. I asked the Minister yesterday why those documents were not present. At that stage I was of the understanding that Mr Symons had entered into a deed of arrangement. At any rate, whatever his arrangement is with his creditors&mdash;it turns out that it was a composition&mdash;that document should have been on the file and the certificate of release, if any had been issued, should also have been on the file.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The simple fact is that Senator O'Chee's staff member looked at the wrong file&mdash;failed to find the information he was seeking, and then the Senator rushed into the public debate with a completely erroneous set of allegations", Senator Tate said.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that my search clerk did have the right file. When I was in Question Time yesterday I had the statement of affairs that was sworn by Mr Gregory Bernard Symons on 27 September 1989. There is no more incontrovertible proof that these documents came from Gregory Bernard Symons's file. The correct file was searched, but the documents in question relating to Mr Symons's insolvency agreements, the documents relating to his possible release from those agreements, were not available for my search clerk. That is a breach of the Bankruptcy Act and a breach of the bankruptcy regulations. These are statutory public documents. Why were they absent from the file? Why were they not given to my search clerk?</PARA>

He came into the Senate and tabled the information. I congratulate him; at least we have one Government Minister who wants to table information.

It was item NX227/89. Notice was given that Gregory Bernard Symons was to pay his trustee on behalf of his creditors the sum of $25,000 on or before 31 December 1989. That was the deal that Mr Symons did to be released from $1.5m of debts. It goes further. Had the documents I sought been available to me yesterday, it would have been possible to show that Mr Symons in fact did not meet those requirements, did not in fact pay the money until some time in October 1991 and that his certificate of release, far from being signed in December 1989 or early 1990, was not signed by his trustee until November 1991, almost two years after the due date for Mr Symons to pay the $25,000. </PARA>

The $25,000 payment made by Mr Symons to relieve himself of $1.5m of debt coincided with an export market development grant given by Austrade to Mr Symons in or about October 1991. In effect, not only has Mr Symons evaded $1.5m of debt by doing this cosy little arrangement with some of his creditors but moreover there is a very strong case to be put that the Australian taxpayer has provided Mr Symons with the money that he needed to get out of his bankruptcy obligations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument could be made by those on the other side of the chamber, if they had enough wit or wisdom to try to put the argument, that Mr Symons first of all had to expend funds to get an export market development grant. Indeed, he would. But there is one little problem with that: when Mr Symons swore the affidavit verifying his statement of affairs on 27 September 1989 he said that his total realisable assets amounted to $10 cash at bank. The $10 millionaire!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Mr Symons's total assets were $10, how could he expend enough money to be due a $131,000 export market development grant? Either one of two things occurred: either Mr Symons was due that grant at the time at which he swore the statement of affairs and he did not disclose it or he received funding from another source. That is a matter of which Austrade should have inquired and a matter of which Austrade should be cognisant. This Senate and the Australian people deserve to know how it was that $131,000 of taxpayers' money was made available to Mr Symons, and about that time he used $25,000 to pay off $1.5m of bankruptcy obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If only all the poor indebted people of Australia could have the good fortune of Mr Symons, could have the good fortune to trip around the world whilst technically insolvent under administration. If only all the poor people of Australia could have the benefit of Mr Symons and the mates who are going to look after him, the mates to assist them get into arrangements with other governments and get appointments overseas when at the time they are totally incapable of being involved in the management of any company in Australia. That is the nub of the whole thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time at which Mr Symons saw Senator Richardson, at the time at which Mr Symons saw Senator Sibraa, at the time at which Mr Symons went to the US and used the facilities of our embassy there, at the time at which Mr Symons obtained the $131,000 export market development grant, he was an insolvent under administration and by virtue of section 229 of the corporations law he was barred from being involved in the management of a company. He could not legally be involved in the management of a company, yet Mr Symons, through all of this, seemed totally oblivious to the obligations of the law that applied to everybody else. Mr Symons continued to get his export market development grants. Mr Symons continued to get access to Australian embassies to do business on behalf of another government&mdash;whether personally or through a company is a matter that has yet to be revealed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these things now require answering by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; all of these things require answering by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). It is wholly unsatisfactory for the Minister to say to this Parliament that he will withhold those documents because they are commercial in confidence or because they relate to some trial in another jurisdiction. We are concerned about this jurisdiction and we are concerned about the very serious problems that seem to have arisen in relation to this export market development grant and possibly others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not a skerrick of doubt that Mr Symons has been involved in some very interesting transactions. There is not a skerrick of doubt that every thinking Australian should wonder where Mr Symons&mdash;the $10 millionaire&mdash;got sufficient funds to be entitled to a $131,000 export market development grant. Every thinking Australian should expect the Minister to provide those documents to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On this day twenty five years ago, Australians voted in a referendum by a 91% margin to support change to the Australian Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some would say that such a level of support for constitutional reform would be worth commemorating in itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 27 May 1967, the Australian people gave the Commonwealth Parliament power to make laws with respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and to include them in the national census.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As with many constitutional issues, the technical meaning of these amendments does not fully explain their significance. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and many other Australians see the referendum as a turning point in white and black relations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result of the referendum, the 91% endorsement of the proposition that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were to be regarded as part of the Australian nation, signified the beginning of a new maturity of outlook and understanding of the position of indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importantly the passage of the referendum is the very foundation of Commonwealth action in Aboriginal affairs. Without the change to the constitution there would have been no legal or constitutional capacity for the national Parliament to make any laws directed towards Aboriginal people and in current times there would be no Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and no action by the Commonwealth Parliament to initiate the process of reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quoting from the YES case provided to voters twenty-five years ago illustrates the point. In clear terms, the pamphlet states that the constitutional change to Commonwealth powers would</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"remove words . . . which many people think are discriminatory against Aborigines</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"enable the National Parliament to make laws . . . relating to Aboriginals</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and that</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"the Commonwealth's object will be to cooperate with the States to ensure that together we act in the best interests of the Aboriginal people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe it is important for the Senate to reflect on how the overwhelming endorsement of the constitutional change came about, and on the lessons that we can learn as we continue to work towards justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to give five brief quotes from the debate in the House of Representatives on the Constitutional Alteration (Aboriginals) Bill 1967, as I believe that they raise important issues for us to consider today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In introducing the Bill, the Prime Minister, Mr Holt recognised the effective public campaign which had been waged by Aboriginal people and their supporters in support of constitutional change. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"A great deal of thought has been given, both inside and outside the Parliament, to the constitutional provisions relating to the Aboriginal people and there has been much activity by Government private members and organisations concerned with the welfare of the Aboriginals. In the light of this activity the government . . . has decided that an amendment to the Constitution should be put to the people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to take this opportunity to pay a personal tribute to the courage, tenacity and dignity of all those people who worked tirelessly to organise support for the 1967 referendum and who were the driving force for change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Gough Whitlam, the Leader of the Opposition at the time, speaking of the Australian Labor Party's support for the Bill, said:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Members of this Parliament will be able for the first time to do something for Aboriginals&mdash;Aboriginals representing the greatest pockets of poverty and disease in this country. . . . Hitherto it has been impossible for the Commonwealth to do these things directly itself. Hereafter it will be possible for the Commonwealth to provide the Aboriginals with some of that social capital with which most other Australians are already endowed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Three other contributions to the debate are especially worth remembering, being contributions from three of the great Parliamentary champions of Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The then Member for Mackellar, W.C. Wentworth, said:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Some people say&mdash;I think wrongly&mdash;that no discrimination is necessary in regard to Aboriginal people. I think that some discrimination is necessary. But I think it should be favourable, not unfavourable. . . . It is not right to say to these people: `We will treat you as we would treat any other Australian.' To do this would submerge and destroy their culture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The then Member for Wills, Gordon Bryant, said:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"When all is said and done, this is only the first of three steps that will have to be taken. The proposal must first be passed by the Parliament. Then we must get the support of a majority of the people in a majority of the States. Then we as a Parliament and as individual members must take up the challenge on behalf of the Aboriginal people and recover the last 180 years. . . . I hope honourable members will realise that it is not sufficient just to hope and pray that this referendum will be passed. We ought, in honour bound, to campaign with the full vigour with which we campaign to return ourselves to the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My final quotation is from what I respectfully consider to be the most powerful and far-sighted contribution to the debate on that occasion, that of the then Member for Fremantle, Kim Beazley senior:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have the problem that as self-government has advanced in this country, there is no question but that the status of Aboriginals has declined. . . . I believe that the Government of the Commonwealth, which is exposed to the conscience of the world and must answer to the world on these issues, should have this prohibition on legislating on Aboriginal affairs . . . deleted from the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I say that the Australian people must be deliberately responsible. I believe their very security is involved in their being able to say to the world that this community will ensure sane and just race relations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Bill was read for a third time, and following a division, the unanimous support of the House of Representatives was recorded. Members of Parliament from both sides took up the challenge to join with community organisations and individuals, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal to campaign for a yes vote. The question was put to the people on 27 May 1967 and received the overwhelming endorsement I have referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The essential lessons I want to draw from the debate and the results are these:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;that the combined activity of Members of Parliament and community organisations concerned with Aboriginal people profoundly shaped and influenced the Government's position and that of the Opposition;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;that the issues of justice for indigenous Australians ought to transcend party political pointscoring and that nothing less than our identity as a nation and place in the world is at stake; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;that the Federal Parliament has a consequent moral and political responsibility to act to redress Aboriginal disadvantage, and to seek to meet Aboriginal aspirations. If we can put aside differences and speak with one voice that leadership of itself sends a powerful message to the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These lessons are of enormous contemporary importance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have said before that the desire to regain cross-party cooperation in Aboriginal affairs was one of my first goals as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, the desire to regain and re-build the overwhelming community support achieved in 1967 was fundamental to the strategy in developing the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members will recall that that Act achieved unanimous support in both Houses of the Parliament, and that the Act included a powerful preamble:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"That as part of the reconciliation process, the Commonwealth will seek an ongoing national commitment from governments at all levels to cooperate and to coordinate with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission as appropriate to address progressively Aboriginal disadvantage and aspirations in relation to land, housing, law and justice, cultural heritage, education, employment, health, infrastructure, economic development and any other relevant matters in the decade leading to the centenary of Federation, 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unanimous support was achieved:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;for an Act which requires initiatives to promote a just reconciliation between Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and the wider community;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;for an Act which requires extensive public education about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history, culture, past dispossession and continuing disadvantage, and the need to address that disadvantage; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;for an Act which places firmly on the public policy agenda of this country the question of whether reconciliation would be advanced by a formal document or documents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All Australians must take up the challenge begun in 1967 and involve themselves directly in promoting a lasting reconciliation to the Australian community. A reconciliation which, as the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Act commits us, is based on justice and which has a major focus in local communities across this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the last few days many Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people have asked the question, "here we are, twenty five years down the track, and what progress have we made in ending Aboriginal disadvantage?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not my intention to use this occasion to be an apologist for Governments around Australia for the things which remain to be done. Nor have I any intention of minimising the extent of outstanding injustice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody brought home to us just how far we still have to go despite the great distance we have already travelled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has given support to 338 of the 339 recommendations of the Royal Commission which establish a practical and detailed agenda for change and the Government welcomes the support given by the Opposition to the Commonwealth response to that Royal Commission. The Government has announced new funding to implement recommendations of the Report and will be announcing further funding within the month to tackle the underlying disadvantages that the Royal Commission found give rise to overrepresentation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in custody.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importantly, the Government has established a rigorous and thorough regime of reporting and monitoring mechanisms. The regime is centred around monitoring by ATSIC and an annual "state of the nation report" to ensure that progress can be measured and that the response of governments to the Royal Commission will not be allowed to gather dust on a shelf.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this way we can keep our nation accountable for the implementation of the Royal Commission recommendations and for meeting those Aboriginal aspirations to which the Federal Parliament has unanimously committed itself to in the reconciliation process as a national objective leading to the centenary of Federation in 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Support has now been forthcoming from the States and Territories for the reconciliation process and the Commonwealth will continue to seek to work with the States to give effect to the Royal Commission recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the Royal Commission also made it clear how important attitudes of mind and heart are in underpinning the achievement of real social justice. As was the case with the referendum result of 1967, a lasting answer to achieving justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people requires a change in the attitudes of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From that referendum 25 years ago grew the acknowledgment that Aboriginal people themselves could and should set the agenda, that Aboriginal political, economic and cultural values have their own validity and place within the diversity that is Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been an increasing recognition that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people must be able to make decisions for themselves on their own future as reflected in what is now the cross-party support for the existence of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves can take the credit for changing the way we look at the issues, as they assert their Aboriginality, their right to be heard and to implement their own solutions to the issues they face.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly, there remains much to do. Our speeches today, should not be read by Aboriginal people, by Torres Strait Islander people or by any other Australians as self congratulatory. It is more a matter of acknowledging that first but very necessary step in formalising equitable relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody brought home to us just how far we still have to go, and how important attitudes of mind and heart are in underpinning the achievement of real social justice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister addressed the inaugural meeting of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation in February. He said that, in his view, the current status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is awful and he suggested that the Council, and by implication, all of us, need to act in a practical and concrete manner to change the status quo. That, indeed, is the great challenge, and the great opportunity, facing the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, as it sets out on its historic task.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Experience since 1967 has shown us that there is more to social justice than carefully designed programs of assistance. And that is where the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation has an important role. The Council is to be the catalyst in seeking a better knowledge and understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples&mdash;their cultures and experiences&mdash;so that there can be a fundamental change in attitudes, and therefore in relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When we have achieved that attitudinal change we may have discovered the missing pieces of the jigsaw that prevents us from completing the picture of the Australia that we all want to see and be part of.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As with the efforts that produced the Referendum result of 1967, the lasting answer to the relationships issue rests with people&mdash;the ordinary people of this country&mdash;and their attitudes toward each other.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There can be no higher objective for our country and its people as we count down to the centenary of our Federation than that we achieve a just reconciliation between the wider community and the original inhabitants, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of this country, the first Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 1967 referendum is often referred to as a landmark in Aboriginal affairs. The 25 years since then represents a large chunk of this country's history since European settlement&mdash;nearly one-eighth. From the view of this land's indigenous people, that 25 years is just a blip in the tens of thousands of years of their history on this continent. From that perspective of time, the enormous changes and upheavals which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have had to endure are even more tumultuous than would at first appear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1967 referendum is significant for the fact that it achieved easily the greatest level of agreement amongst Australians with 91 per cent of people voting yes to enable Aboriginal people to be counted as Australians and to enable the Commonwealth Government to make laws for Aboriginal people throughout the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 25 years since the referendum result there have been many more changes and developments. There have been concerted and generally well-intentioned efforts to redress some of the wrongs perpetrated on the indigenous people. As we all know, not all these efforts have met with success. In recent times the many failures and injustices which have been enacted by governments of this nation have been widely described and acknowledged in this Parliament: for example, at the time of the establishment of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and the bringing down of the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, as well as the more recent governmental responses to those recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is clearly wrong to suggest that 1967 marked the end of discrimination against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is not as though suddenly and magically after 1967 everything was righted and it was all plain sailing.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, the horrendous act of removing Aboriginal children from their families continued. So too did the incredible restrictions which were placed on the lives of Aboriginal people living on reserves. The restrictive laws and practices placed over the lives of those people still have not been fully removed today. The legacy of those acts, and the many other brutal and appalling acts which went hand in hand with the colonisation of this land and the dispossession of its indigenous people, is still very much with us today and is even more strongly present in the collective and individual consciousness of this land's indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stacked up against this legacy of injustice, the 1967 referendum is a very small act of redress. Nonetheless, it is a powerful symbol. The occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary is perhaps a good time to acknowledge some of the positive achievements that have occurred; but in making the acknowledgment I stress that I do not see it as some sort of ultimate checklist of how well we have done. I see these things as simply beginnings. We have seen the development of Aboriginal legal services, beginning in Redfern in 1970; Aboriginal health and medical services, starting again in Redfern in 1971; and land rights legislation in the Northern Territory in 1976, still seen by many of us as the best such legislation in this country. We have seen laws that go some way, although often not far enough, towards protecting sacred sites and significant areas and items that are part of the indigenous people's traditional heritage. We have seen the handing back of Uluru and Katherine Gorge to their traditional owners in 1985 and 1989 respectively. These actions were also a powerful symbol of correcting past dispossession and injustice. In 1990 we saw the establishment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, which was a significant move, I believe, towards enabling the goal of self-determination to be more achievable. The Australian Democrats believe that ATSIC is a body which must be supported and given the opportunity to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another positive step in recent years has been a significant development of a number of indigenous media outlets. Imparja Television, which began transmissions in 1988 from Alice Springs, is perhaps the most well known of these. I am pleased to note that my home city, Brisbane, will soon see the Brisbane Indigenous Media Association being able to operate with its own licence. As well as the electronic media, magazines and papers such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Koori Mail</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Land Rights News</EMPHASIS> are also in evidence. These media outlets provide a much needed voice for indigenous people. We are able to see the way in which they have been treated by mainstream media. These are not solutions; these are simply small steps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year saw the establishment of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, a body of which I am proud to be a member. It has the task of rekindling the spirit of the 1967 referendum and of getting the whole of Australia to acknowledge the special position of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the history of this land. It is a history which is so ancient as to make the last 25 years seem a blink of the eye, but it is also a history which is still under threat. </PARA>

The Commonwealth's response and the response of State and Territory governments to these recommendations is something which we in the Senate have not yet had the opportunity to properly debate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was around the time of the 1967 referendum that interest in Aboriginal culture began to develop. It is obvious, though not yet widely recognised, that indigenous cultures are integral to an Australian identity. The notion of a national identity is something which has gained some attention of late, particularly because of Prime Minister Keating's remarks on the flag and republicanism. I would have liked to have seen him extend his remarks to make clear that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their traditions, culture and heritage have a major part to play in the formation and composition of a true Australian identity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to note in a speech made recently by the Chairperson of ATSIC, Lois O'Donoghue, to commemorate the 1967 referendum that she referred to an item which listed the things that Americans most associated with Australia. The top five items included Aborigines, koalas, kangaroos and the Great Barrier Reef. This is a simple example of how integral Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are to the very nature of Australia. Sometimes we use this culture in an exploitative way, particularly when we pick and choose to suit our own tourism demands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The culture of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is one which we are starting to recognise has a value for all Australians. So, too, are we acknowledging its importance. As we tackle global environmental issues, we take time to reflect upon the approaches taken by those who lived in harmony with this land for so many years. We need to consider those approaches. We need to look anew for the lessons contained therein. The 1967 referendum is often seen as the time when Aboriginal people were finally acknowledged as being part of the Australian nation. I think that is far too generous an interpretation to place upon the significance of the 1967 referendum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a special mention of the role of Torres Strait Islander people. Torres Strait Islanders are still often seen as being indistinguishable from Aboriginal people and the reality of their own distinct culture and history is often overlooked. As a minority within a minority, being a group whose homeland is so far from where 99 per cent of Australians live, Torres Strait Islanders often find their culture and their needs ignored. Whilst this is a small group of people, their role in the future of this nation should not be overlooked. </PARA>

As we move towards 2001, consideration is being given by many people to what changes should be made to our Constitution to make it more appropriate and more relevant to our nation as it enters the twenty-first century. The place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in our nation must be a very important part of that consideration. </PARA>

In the past several years it has been involved in the conduct of the Royal Commission, especially in the assessment of the Royal Commission's findings. A genuinely bipartisan approach has been taken in this Parliament, with the Labor Party and the Liberal and National parties responding positively to the Commission's findings.

As the first Minister for Aboriginal Affairs he began a tradition of close, genuine sharing of ideas by both sides of Parliament, both in the House of Representatives and the Senate, that was continued under Minister Bryant who, in the Whitlam Government, set up the Department of Aboriginal Affairs.

Neville Bonner's portrait hangs proudly in this new Parliament House. As a Liberal senator, he was a party to all of the discussions about Aboriginal affairs and decisions, certainly during the Fraser Government period, and thereafter in the whole period of his service here in this Parliament as the first elected Aboriginal member of any parliament. He remains a close friend, as do the others I have mentioned. </PARA>

There are so many in this family who have shared ideas about what we can do in the Parliament to improve the environment of the Aboriginal people. You, Mr Acting Deputy President, have served on the council of the Institute of Aboriginal Studies, as I have for some five years. We in this community have all brought forward ideas. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention this because that one per cent of Australians who have been in contact with us these last 25 years, the Aboriginal people of Australia, have, through their dialogue with us and through our attempts to respond to them, created a community of parliamentarians who are in fact in a family together. That has perhaps been a little less distinct in the past few years because of the setting up of the successor to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in that we now have an independent and fully Aboriginal institute that, through its council, is to look after the affairs of and initiatives from the Commonwealth in Aboriginal affairs. That family began with the Liberal and National parties and it has continued with the Labor Party in government. It went again with the Liberal Fraser Government.

Unfortunately, Ken died last year. I remember teaching him mathematics. Ken, a few years younger than I, and at school at the time, went on to become a director of the Aboriginal affairs department in at least one State. He was a most senior and respected Aboriginal leader in employment matters and in a wide range of Aboriginal initiatives. It was with real sadness that I learned that he died last year. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I especially wanted to remark on my friendship with Lois O'Donoghue throughout the whole of my time here in the Senate. She is now the leading Aboriginal decision maker in Australia. She does that in consultation with representatives of all the Aboriginal people of Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twenty-five years ago today, an overwhelming majority of Australians voted in a referendum to give the Commonwealth Government power to legislate over Aboriginal affairs. Until then, Aboriginal policy, regarded as a welfare function, was the province of the states, although the Commonwealth had direct responsibilities in the Northern Territory. The referendum result reflected a clear view by most Australians that something more&mdash;and something better&mdash;had to be done; that the paltry efforts until that time had been a national and an international embarrassment. By almost any standard of well-being&mdash;health, education, employment, housing or socio-economic status&mdash;Aborigines were the worst-off of all Australians. They were only beginning to emerge from formal legal discriminations. Underfunded paternalistic rule&mdash;which tended to measure Aboriginal "advancement" in terms of complete assimilation into white society and abandonment of Aboriginal culture and traditions&mdash;coupled with decades of remoteness, public indifference and hostility, at last was overtaken by a belief on the part of most Australians that a prosperous and civilised society should, and could, do more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twenty-five years later, the situation in Aboriginal affairs remains a national and international embarrassment. Similar social and economic indices would show, at best, that Aborigines still lagged behind other Australians to at least the same extent; in many key areas, particularly health, there has been little improvement at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem now, however, is not primarily one of funds; nor, over most of the intervening period, has it been one of broad goodwill on the part of government or most Australians. More than $25 billion, in today's value, has been spent on programs specifically focused on Aboriginal advancement. A considerable bureaucracy was established, both at government level and in Aboriginal communities. Some of the investment has produced good results: in general terms, for example, Aborigines are now better housed, even if housing for too many Aborigines is still inadequate. Even acknowledging that progress takes time and that some programs, in education, say, yield results only after years of effort, it is clear that more of the same is not necessarily going to produce much better results. It is also doubtful how much longer the political will exists to maintain current levels of funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real question is whether&mdash;assuming the will exists&mdash;more of the same is capable of producing necessary changes. There are increasing arguments that it is not. Two of the primary enemies of change&mdash;the collectivisation of Aborigines, and the bureaucratisation of their affairs&mdash;are increasing, and widening the gulf between Aborigines and other Australians. Aborigines are becoming increasingly dependent on government. That the form of government has a facade of Aboriginal control cannot mask the pauperisation and lack of effective service-delivery involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">TOO FEW funds are devoted to creating capital that will enhance the capacity of Aborigines, individually or corporately, to make their own way; too much is spent creating local economies&mdash;remote from the wider community&mdash;based on everyone taking in each other's washing. Aboriginal initiative is still seriously stifled, far too much Aboriginal energy remains focused on notions that real change depends primarily on non-Aborigines doing something&mdash;whether changing the law or changing attitudes&mdash;rather than seizing the hour and the opportunities themselves. Aboriginal Australians, for many reasons, have a claim on the conscience of other Australians. But liberation from their disadvantage depends on their determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twenty-five years ago most Australians believed that government&mdash;the Commonwealth Government in particular&mdash;ought to do more for Aborigines. It took time for that "more" to occur but, in the intervening period, most of the limits of what government could do have been reached. Aborigines are in a far better position in 1992 to take a very critical look at where the energy, resources and expenditures of the past 25 years have gone, what has been achieved and what has failed. The political will to help Aborigines still exists, though it has to some extent been diluted by disappointment. Whether by May 27, 2017&mdash;50 years after the referendum&mdash;Aboriginal Australians still stand out for disadvantage to the extent they did in 1967 and 1992 depends more on the way they redirect their energies over the next 25 years than on their building on the precarious base constructed over the past 25.</PARA>

I regard it as a terrible loss, and so too does her community.

In Western Australia, the ATSIC elections have been declared invalid and concern has been expressed that Aboriginal leaders employed in government agencies which had wasted millions of dollars have lost touch with grassroots Aboriginal people.

It challenges us to address the inherent racism within Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to share with honourable senators the story of this trust and how it came about. One Saturday morning in January 1992 at about 3 a.m., 19-year-old Louis Johnson was walking home along a road in the quiet middle-class Perth suburb of North Beach. It was his birthday and he had been at a party. He stopped to lie down on the grass verge for a while. Some time later a car containing five other youths completely unknown to him pulled up alongside. The three boys and two girls got out of the car and Louis was viciously bashed by two of them while the others watched. He was then left lying beside the road. Moments later some of the youths returned in the car and deliberately ran over him at high speed. The five white youths then returned to observe their victim. The driver said to the group, `I have got him. I am glad I got the black sod'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Louis lay beside North Beach Road with massive internal injuries and a shattered pelvis until a passing cyclist spotted him at around 7 a.m. and called for an ambulance. Waiting for the ambulance, Louis was still conscious and lucid enough to talk to the cyclist who, as a lay person, had formed the view that Louis was seriously ill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tragic ironies seem to attach themselves to this horrific affair. Louis's middle name was St John. He was a fully paid up subscriber to the St John's Ambulance fund. But, according to the cyclist, the ambulance attendants simply assumed, without any examination, that Louis had been sniffing petrol. Instead of taking him to hospital, they took him home, telling his younger sister that he was intoxicated, that it was not a hospital case and that he should sleep it off in bed. Later that morning the Johnsons found their son in bed. It was obvious that he was seriously injured and they called a second ambulance. Louis died before it arrived. His grieving father, Bill, described his son as dying with `dignity, courage and stoicism'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a taped confession to police after being arrested some days later, the driver of the car claimed that it had not been his intention to kill Louis, only to break his legs. Why had he done it? He answered openly, `Because he was black'. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to seven years and nine months in prison. Another youth was awaiting trial at the time this material was written. He has pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the sinister circumstances became established, this killing should have attracted prominent media attention, given the fact that, according to a concurrent media campaign, Perth was in the grip of a spiralling youth crime rampage. Only nine days earlier, on Boxing Day, youths had stolen a car and, while under high speed pursuit by police, had collided with another car, killing a pregnant mother and her son. This was the latest of about a dozen tragic deaths during such high speed car chases in little over a year and it intensified the media and public campaign for a police and legislative crackdown on juvenile crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But somehow, Louis Johnson never achieved the status of an emblematic `victim of youth crime' in the way the previous fatalities did. With the sole exception of the weekly <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Times</EMPHASIS> some two months after the killing, his case was not taken up by the media with equal fervour, despite being in some ways even more horrifying than those of car chase victims. For instance, where those deaths were accidental, Louis's assailants attacked him with premeditated and repeated violence. Moreover, Louis was killed because he was Aboriginal, and for no other reason. Thus, in Western Australia enormous emotional values were attached to accidental killings but they did not seem to apply to the cold-blooded racist murder of an innocent Aboriginal man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relative lack of media interest in the killing of Louis Johnson raises serious questions about the entire structure of news reporting in Perth and about the role of the media in shaping public attitudes towards crime, aboriginality and justice. The muted media response to Louis Johnson's murder was nowhere so quiet as on Perth's high rating morning radio program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Sattler File</EMPHASIS>. It was not mentioned. This silence is noteworthy as Howard Sattler has established himself as the unchallenged champion of previous victims of juvenile crime. He used his show to mobilise a gathering of up to 20,000 people at Parliament House in August 1991 to demand stiffer gaol sentences for juvenile offenders&mdash;the so-called Rally for Justice. It was Howard Sattler who kicked off this crusade in April 1990 with a now notorious pronouncement on air about the deaths of three Aboriginal youths in a high-speed police chase. Sattler said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I say good riddance to bad rubbish, that's three less car thieves, I think they're dead and I think that's good.</PARA>
<PARA>I might add that although criticisms have been made to the Australian Journalists Association and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, this matter has not been satisfactorily redressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sattler went on to convert his program into one of the most effective public policy lobbies ever seen in Perth, with daily stolen car reports, interviews with victims of crime and promotions for the Rally for Justice. Balanced journalism got short shrift as Sattler deftly classified as `protectors of criminals' anyone who suggested that locking kids in gaol was not the best solution to juvenile offending. The do-gooder social workers, profiteering lawyers and lenient judges, the heads in the sand academics, the self-promoting Human Rights Commissioner, fringe groups and the Aboriginal Legal Service were given those adjectives by Saddler in order to discredit their genuine concerns about what was happening in Western Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These issues are not being addressed in any other context that I am aware of. The report addresses the problem of racist violence. We have seen the way in which radio talkback has, in one instance, promoted racism within a community. It has also led to a government knee-jerk response in providing juvenile justice legislation which I believe is rightly considered by the Federal Government to be in breach of international human rights treaties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not come very far in 25 years if we can sanction broadcasting which promotes racism and condones values that violate Australia's participation in the international treaties of human rights. It is an indictment of the 200 years of European occupation of this country that its original inhabitants who have thousands of years in this land, only 25 years ago, received minimal recognition.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We still have not corrected the historical lie at the base of Australian common law&mdash;the lie of terra nullius, empty land, which Captain Cook proclaimed on landing in New South Wales. Until that lie is acknowledged and the issue of national land rights is addressed, there can be no future for reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a responsibility to address racism and injustice. We have a responsibility to address the lie on which our country has been based. We also have much to gain from addressing these problems. We are unaware of the spiritual contribution of Aboriginal people because of our inability to accept them within the full ambit of our society. We have much to gain from the equality and spiritual recognition of Aboriginal people. Their respect for the land and their care for family and community have much to teach us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude by referring to a symbol of Aboriginal spirituality and of how much we have to gain: the Aboriginal flag that was hung at half-mast today and which I believe was a fitting symbol and ceremony to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of enfranchisement.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal flag is divided horizontally into equal halves of black at the top and red at the bottom with a yellow circle at the centre. The black symbolises Aboriginal people and the yellow is the sun, the constant giver and renewer of life. Red depicts the earth; it also represents ochre which is used by Aboriginal people in their religious ceremonies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The flag was first flown at Victoria Square, Adelaide on National Aborigines Day on 12 July 1971 and was later used at the tent embassy in Canberra in 1972.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the ceremony today there was another flag, which was a contribution by a South Australian group. It was a design which incorporated both the Aboriginal flag colours and the Southern Cross. While the spirit underlying the design is commendable, it exposes the sad reality of how far we are from such a point. This deep significance deserves to be considered. There can be no genuine talk of reconciliation until the day the Aboriginal flag has equal status on our flagpole with the Union Jack. It would have been a fitting symbol for today to share our flagpole with the Aboriginal flag. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating today a very historic anniversary, the twenty-fifth anniversary of a most significant change to the Australian Constitution.

I acknowledge the contribution by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and equally that of the Opposition spokesperson, Michael Wooldridge, in the other place this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the 1967 referendum was a major turning point in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal relations in this country. In the time that I have this afternoon I would like to speak about the past, briefly about the present but, more importantly, about the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like a number of my colleagues&mdash;and Senator Teague has spoken of his involvement in the 1967 referendum campaign&mdash;I too was involved in the referendum campaign in North Queensland. In North Queensland in 1967, as I am sure many honourable senators will understand, I had no concept of a 91 per cent acceptance of that constitutional change. It was a major victory. It was a very pleasant surprise to us when that vote was announced from around the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important, however, to acknowledge the work of the people who were involved so closely in the pioneering work amongst Aboriginal and Islander people at that time in 1967. People like Faith Bandler, John Newfong, Joe McGuiness, Charles Perkins and Pat O'Shane&mdash;names that then did not mean anything very much to anybody, I am sure they will agree, but names that have become very significant names in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community over the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the referendum in North Queensland a number of us got together and said, `Really, what is needed now is some follow-up to the referendum'. We were involved in a major conference that was called, `We the Australians, what is to follow the referendum?' At the time some of us thought the name was a little quaint and that perhaps it did not go all the way to emphasising the crucial significance of the referendum passing, but we wanted to ensure that governments of whatever political persuasion did actually act on that very historic reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our conference was addressed by people like Dr Colin Tatz, Professor Charles Rowley, Joe McGuiness and Faith Bandler. At that time, again, in North Queensland it was regarded as a somewhat sinister conference. It was a conference that did not have the support of many people in the community. It did not have the support of the National Party Government of the day, but it was an important conference for our community. I believe that it was an important conference in terms of the participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and other Australians who, for the first time, came together&mdash;in that part of the world anyway&mdash;for a conference to debate the issues and to look at the future agenda.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I am very happy to be in a position to now speak in this debate 25 years later and acknowledge the work of those people 25 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to talk briefly about the present and then move on to what does need to be achieved in the future.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In talking about the present it is important to acknowledge that, while the passing of that referendum was historic, while there have been so many changes in social policy, in social attitudes and in opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, there is certainly no cause for what I would call celebration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate to commemorate and to mark this significant milestone, but despite all the best efforts&mdash;and Senator Teague spoke about Ministers and governments&mdash;all have succeeded and all have failed in some respects. That is a tragedy for all Australians in that yes, there have been tremendous social reforms; yes, there has been good intent on behalf of governments and Ministers; and yes, a great deal has been achieved; but we are only a short way down the track with regard to fundamental change in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander policy in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that we will have an opportunity to understand just how far we have yet to go down that path of changing attitudes if we look at some of the attitudes that are available through opinion polling about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia in 1991. Whereas in 1967 we were able to achieve that magnificent 91 per cent support, now, when we look at some of the statistics, there is some cause for concern, but equally some cause for optimism. For example, with regard to the question, `Should Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders take more responsibility for their own lives?' there was an overwhelming 96 per cent yes vote, according to the opinion poll. But in the same opinion poll, when asked, `What about self-government for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people?' the vote was only 35 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, there is a very real double standard here. On the one hand the Australian community is very quick to blame Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, and tell them that they should get out and do things in the way that other Australians do. On the other hand, when we say in the next breath, `What about land rights? What about self-government? What about autonomy?' immediately the answer is `Oh no, we don't mean that. We mean that Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders should do more, but we are not prepared to give them the autonomy with which to do so'. That is a fundamental conflict that has to be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting, on a more optimistic note, however, that in regard to questions relating to strengthening Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island culture, and more funds being made available for doing so with regard to education and employment training, the statistics go up into the 70s and the 80s: 88 per cent for strengthening culture; 76 per cent for special education programs; and 78 per cent for special employment programs. However, when it comes to Australians who would support a formal recognition that Australian Aborigines and Islanders were the first Australians in terms of being here before colonisation&mdash;a treaty or some other form of document, declaration, compact; the name does not matter&mdash;then only 55 per cent support such a treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, I come very much to the future. We can mark the anniversary today with this admirable motion, we reaffirm our previous commitments, we emphasise the work that needs to be done on the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, but I believe that the most significant work that has yet to be done is the speeding up of a change of attitude in Australia. We do not have another 25 years, frankly. We have had 25 years to get to where we are today. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people have been extremely patient, but I have to say to honourable senators without being alarmist, I hope, that I just wonder how long their patience will last. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I said something similar in a debate leading up to the Bicentenary in 1988. I say again, in the lead up to 1993 as International Year of Indigenous People, that as the Government, the Opposition and the Australian community, we all have a responsibility to speed up that attitude change and that commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to read what Lois O'Donoghue, the Chairperson of ATSIC, said in her final remarks at the National Press Club. She spoke very clearly about what she and ATSIC expect in terms of the future. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any new constitution had to abandon the doctrine of terra nullius&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and Senator Chamarette has touched on this. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that assumption that Australia was unoccupied in 1788, and recognise Aborigines as an essential part of the popular sovereignty from which the new document would derive its authority. This recognition would not threaten the wider population. It would be used as partnership and reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, brings me to those words that frighten many politicians&mdash;not the politicians, I am sure, who have spoken today&mdash;such as `sovereignty', `self-government' and `autonomy'. Even `national land rights' terrifies some politicians in all parts of this chamber and the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we have to come to terms, first of all, with our history. As has been said, terra nullius is the ultimate historic lie. This is acknowledged in our own current <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Year Book Australia</EMPHASIS>. Our own current <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Year Book</EMPHASIS> states quite clearly that Aborigines have lived in Australia for at least 40,000 years, and that before European settlement Aborigines left no written records, so deduction is from archaeological and anthropological evidence. It details more recent research suggesting that the length of occupation by Aboriginal people has been much greater. That is what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Year Book</EMPHASIS> states, but our legal system still pretends that terra nullius is a fact of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, of course, a very significant case in the High Court at the moment that I believe will, once and for all, I hope, deny the lie of terra nullius. Maybe then, together with Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders, we will be able to get down to the serious business of negotiating a treaty, a pact, an agreement. One of the reasons for the significant areas of racism that we are all aware of is that people do not understand why there needs to be special programs, special conditions and special arrangements for our indigenous people. I believe that with the focus on Australia in 1993, we will need to work much more quickly and much more strenuously to ensure that we do give genuine recognition to our indigenous Australians. One of the starting points in that process is to override the lie of terra nullius. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, I do not believe that we have another 25 years to work through these issues. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people have been very patient.

I believe that we really must finish that process by the year 2001.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That regulation 35 of the AUSTUDY Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1991 No. 480 and made under the Student Assistance Act 1973, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA>The issue of student financial assistance has been brought into the spotlight once again. The release of the Chapman report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Austudy: Towards a More Flexible Approach</EMPHASIS>, and today being the National Union of Students national day of action on student financial assistance, highlight the need for re-evaluation and reform of the current system. The student financial assistance scheme, Austudy, remains a restrictive and inequitable system. It is a mass of inconsistencies. Today's debate deals with one of those inequities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have moved this disallowance motion today in order to rectify one of the many problems with the scheme. Regulation 35 deems that the recoverable amount of interest payable on late repayment of overpayments shall be 20 per cent per year. That is, the Government seeks to prescribe a 20 per cent interest rate on the late repayment of Austudy overpayments. While the Student Assistance Act 1973 allows for an interest rate to be charged on these payments, the amount the Government has prescribed in this case is exorbitant. The figure of 20 per cent bears no relation to current market rates, but is loosely based on what the Government has deemed a corresponding provision in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of Austudy is to alleviate financial hardships and to assist participation in education, not to add to these burdens or to cripple students with debts and charges. A 20 per cent interest rate is a punitive measure. It is a measure designed to scare students who have failed to repay or to make arrangements to repay their debts within a three-month period. However, we know the realities of the administration of the Austudy scheme, and it is common knowledge that information such as changes in circumstances leading to overpayments is often not received or is delayed by the Department. The Department of Employment, Education and Training does not deny that many of the students who will incur this excessive amount of interest are simply victims of circumstance, as one DEET official has described them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's intention to prescribe an interest rate on late repayments of overpayments is understandable. It is both necessary and financially sensible to recoup these financial losses, and is a move reflected in many pieces of legislation dealing with the payments of benefits of various kinds. What the Democrats object to is the amount of interest that will be charged in this case. Twenty per cent is an unnecessarily high and punitive amount. I have to say that the measure to disallow this regulation has considerable support amongst both academics and students. On 26 May I received a letter from the Society of St Vincent de Paul.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The situation of overpayments must be examined more closely before this interest figure is determined. We cannot overlook that fact that some of the overpayment cases are the result of administrative difficulties and that many students receive overpayments through no fault of their own but due to the Department failing to respond quickly to or failing to process information. Although as much as $52m per annum was paid to ineligible students last year, over half this money has been recouped and arrangements have been made to recover most of the outstanding funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to the Opposition's belief, students receiving overpayments are not perpetrators of fraudulent deeds or guilty behaviour. It is also necessary to identify the types of people we are talking about. Students are not part of a well off socio-economic order. Typically, students live on incomes that are below the poverty line and may face low living standards. It seems a ruthless move and one that shows a complete lack of understanding of the realities of student life which allows the Government to hit students with an interest rate of 20 per cent on overpayments that may not even be their fault at a time when they may be attempting to find employment or may be without a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for Dr Kemp and the coalition to accuse students who incur an interest rate on overpayments by saying that they have brought it upon themselves. What the Government has failed to do in determining this interest rate, and what the Government and the Opposition consistently fail to do when dealing with financial assistance for students, is examine the realities of student life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats oppose regulation 35 on legislative and financially sustainable grounds. We oppose the excessive amount of interest that is proposed, but base this objection also on legal precedent in the income tax legislation. The rationale behind the interest rate is somewhat misguided. Although there are allowances in corresponding legislation for a 20 per cent interest charge on overpayments such as those contained in the Social Security Act and the Income Tax Assessment Act, the latter is currently under revision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New taxation legislation introduced in Parliament yesterday seeks to clarify the existing Income Tax Assessment Act. The new income tax legislation reviews the legislative penalties and, in so doing, differentiates between the types of actions resulting in underpayment of tax. Currently, section 3 of the Taxation (Interest on Underpayments) Act prescribes an interest rate of 14.026 per cent. This figure is more appropriate financially and illustrates a compatibility with market rates. This figure is the interest rate attached to underpayments of taxation which are the equivalent of Austudy overpayments. In the new tax legislation, for the purposes of recouping tax which is innocently or inadvertently underpaid, the Government nominates a charge which is equal to the 13-week Treasury note average yield plus 4 per cent, and currently this works out to about 10 or 11 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's debate about student financial assistance coincides with the National Union of Students national day of action on Austudy and on the state of the higher education system. NUS is the peak student representative body in Australia, with over 340,000 members. NUS has declared today a national day of action in protest against regressive changes in the higher education system over the last five years that have seen a move towards user pays education. Today's national day of action also anticipates further negative policy changes by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today students are registering their disapproval with the education policies of this Government. They are signalling their objection to the prospect of loans, increased HECS debts, high levels of unmet demand, and the fact that Austudy payments are below the poverty line and are based on false assumptions about student life. Students are also protesting about their work and study conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The release of the Chapman report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Austudy: Towards a More Flexible Approach</EMPHASIS>, has highlighted the role of student financial assistance once again. The Chapman report outlines a variety of options for the reform of Austudy. Many of these recommendations deserve serious consideration if we are to make the scheme more flexible and a more appropriately targeted one. However, the Chapman report also considers some aggressive measures such as the introduction of a loans scheme. The Democrats believe that this would have a devastating effect on participation rates in higher education and we are unanimously opposed to its introduction. The notion that grants should be replaced by a system of loans has alarmed and outraged the student, academic and wider community. They quite rightly see this as formally entrenching user pays education in this country; nor can we expect students from traditionally disadvantaged backgrounds&mdash;this includes women, mature-age, part time, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds&mdash;to face the prospect of debt with equanimity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another proposal is the concept of a `mix and match' loans and grants scheme. To many this represents the thin edge of the wedge and would set a precedent for an erosion in the value of grants. In this scheme students would be able to trade in their grants for twice the amount in a loan form. This loan would then be repaid through the taxation system in a manner similar to that of the higher education contribution scheme. The rhetoric promotes this as increased choice for students. It claims that this represents a more flexible approach in a hitherto restrictive system. The reality, of course, is that many students would be forced to take out the doubled loan amount due to desperate economic circumstances. Thus, the concept of choice is farcical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite a proliferation of Government reports into student financial assistance in the past three years, we have yet to see any substantial reform of the system. There are some changes in the current set of regulations we are debating today that the Democrats do welcome. The increase in the personal income tax threshold from $4,000 to $5,000 is a small step towards defining a realistic personal income threshold so that students are no longer heavily penalised for attempting to earn an income above their meagre Austudy benefits. Until the Government recognises $8,000 per annum as the minimum personal threshold, its commitment to providing a realistic means of student financial support is questionable. It is worth noting that this was a recommendation of the Chapman report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these regulations the minor relaxation in the academic progress rules is also a desirable change. Nevertheless, there remain glaring inequities in the scheme. The definition of `independence' at the age of 25 years has been considered arbitrary and ridiculous for many years. Despite the fact that young people are deemed eligible to vote, to drink, to marry, to bear arms and to drive at the age of 18 and earlier, they are still considered dependent upon their parents until the age of 25 by virtue of being a student. This defies all logic in today's world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assumption that young students up to the age of 25 receive material support from their parents reveals the Government's lack of knowledge about the situation for many young people in society who, despite total financial independence from their families for the purposes of Austudy, are judged to be supported by their parents' incomes. This myth has been exposed many times. Material support for students and young people is not always forthcoming from their parents for many reasons. In fact, young people are often expected to contribute to their families to assist with living costs such as rent, utilities and food. Despite evidence that refutes the assumption that under 21-year-olds are assisted by their parents, Austudy still bases its method of payment on the parental living income and assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change in the independent status from the age of 25 to 21 years is strongly supported by a range of groups in the community, including NUS and the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, and has been reinforced in reports, including the Chapman report and the report of the Government's own House of Representatives Standing Committee on student financial assistance. This week, the AVCC has publicly supported changes to the age of independence. In its report for the 1993-95 triennium entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian universities in a changing world</EMPHASIS>, Austudy is described as `a scheme of fundamental importance to students and especially to fair and equitable access to universities.' It then recommends an increase in Austudy payments to the level of unemployment benefits, a lowering of the age of independence, an increase in the personal income threshold and a review of the parental assets and income test. The AVCC recognises that students are the foundation of our clever country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite these wide-ranging suggestions for reform, the Chapman review was also established. The Chapman report does make some positive recommendations, including increasing the parental and spouse income tests and lowering the age of independence. I urge the Government to implement these reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Students cannot be expected to live and study on a full time basis on very low levels of income, nor can it be expected that they be provided for by their parents. It is time to re-examine our commitment to education and to re-evaluate the concept of student financial assistance as a vital part of this commitment to education. The Government must decide whether Austudy exists as a form of income supplement. If it does, it must allow students to earn additional money without punitive levels of taxation or a low income tax threshold. If Austudy is considered an income in itself, we must provide for a realistic living allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, our concept of education seems to be a narrow one. Our commitment to education does not end when students gain access to an institution. We must ensure that our places of learning are well resourced, adequately staffed and that students' lives are conducive to achieving the best possible standard of education. This means access to places where study conditions are adequate and living standards are sufficient, not a life of poverty and hardship. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent ABS survey showed that the average student weekly income was $119.80. This confirms that students are living on payments substantially below the poverty line. This figure is startling and betrays the fact that, while we claim the future rests with our best and brightest, we are happy to see them struggle and starve. Not only do we expect students to forgo earning income in favour of increasing their skills and knowledge, which is in the nation's interests, but we also penalise them every step of the way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from income forgone, students are expected to live on meagre amounts of financial support and are faced with punitive taxation measures if they attempt to earn money in excess of the personal income threshold of only $5,000 per annum.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has demonstrated an unwillingness to make much needed changes to the Austudy regulations. I might add that these debates about student financial assistance in the past have resulted in an unholy alliance between the coalition and the Government. Our recommendations for reform have received widespread support from the student movement and members of the public. The clever country rhetoric is tiresome. We must demonstrate a realistic commitment to those aspiring to undertake education and training. That means that we cannot afford to lock out of higher education institutions those students who are eligible for places&mdash;certainly not 50,000 of them&mdash;nor can we expect students to survive below the poverty line once they are in education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has an opportunity to make lasting and significant change to this area of the education budget.

It is a desperate question that must be, and has continued to be, addressed by governments of all persuasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition happens to think that the present Austudy scheme has grave inadequacies and that it is wrongly targeted. The Chapman report on Austudy was tabled in the Parliament today&mdash;or at least the Minister has sent me a copy; I do not know whether it has actually been tabled. I received this copy today, which is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Austudy; Towards a More Flexible Approach&mdash;an Options Paper by Bruce Chapman</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chapman report roundly calls for a whole range of new initiatives for Austudy, many of which are in tune with the views of the Opposition&mdash;the Liberal and National parties&mdash;over the last five and even 10 years. He contemplates a more flexible Austudy scheme that would allow students to opt to forsake some part of their grant in order to gain double that amount in a loans scheme that would be repaid under the higher education contribution scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chapman report calls for more precise targeting of those students who are in need. That has been the cry of the Liberal and National parties. There is a call for reviewing the family income assessment so that the present inequities that arise are overcome. Again, the Liberal and National parties have called for that. Above all, there is a call&mdash;a proposition that the Liberal and National parties have been putting for some time&mdash;that no student in Australia should be prevented from taking a course of study through a lack of financial resources alone. The Chapman report finds that a minority&mdash;something like 20 per cent; I cannot find it immediately as I have only been able to look at the report in a cursory way this afternoon&mdash;of students would not have proceeded to tertiary study if there had not been the Austudy payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been seeing for the first time, whether from the Commonwealth scholarship scheme, the tertiary education assistance scheme or the Austudy scheme, that when there is an overpayment or a wrong payment the student has with proper notice three months to repay that overpayment. From 1 January this year there has been 20 per cent per annum interest on that amount of overpayment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, $1.171 billion is paid out in the Austudy scheme. The amount of overpayment or wrong payment is about 4 per cent of that figure. In the last financial year, $42m in overpayments or wrong payments was paid out by the Department of Employment, Education and Training in Austudy benefits. Of that amount, unfortunately, only $19m has been recovered. In summary, $1.2 billion is paid out in Austudy; 4 per cent of that amount is in wrong payment; and only 2 per cent, half of that, is recovered. It is clear that by this new regulation the Government wants to give a direct penalty as an incentive for those overpayments to be returned into the program so that the students for whom Austudy is rightly targeted should receive the benefit and not those for whom it is not targeted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sowada has said that this is an excessive amount. It happens to be exactly the introductory penalty interest rate for those who are at fault in not paying due taxes under the income tax system. Income tax penalties can greatly exceed 20 per cent. I am sure that the parallel between the penalty rate for tax in the Taxation Office and the penalty rate for these payments&mdash;there being such a harmony these days between payments such as Austudy and the tax system&mdash;is appropriate. It is not arbitrary, it is not excessive and it has two buffer periods. First, there is the buffer period of three months before that interest rate begins and, secondly, there is a period in which a student who thinks that this payment ought to be reconsidered, or for which he thinks there is a claim, can appeal through the appropriate appeal mechanisms. In many cases it would be a matter of some six months before that interest rate penalty would begin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition does not support the attempt by the Democrats to eliminate that interest rate penalty; rather, we think it is appropriate. I note that one of the main reasons for overpayment or wrong payment is that an incorrect statement on an application may be discovered when that application is being audited and as a result the assessor within the Department of Employment, Education and Training will review and change the eligibility for all or some of the Austudy payment. Some of it will be backdated to the beginning of the year and some will be backdated to a particular event in the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another reason is where a student changes circumstances but those circumstances are not brought to the attention of the Department until some later period. For example, if a student is enrolled in less than three-quarters of a year's workload, they are no longer defined as a full time student, and Austudy is only available to full time students. If by withdrawing from one half subject a student moves over that line, they may even not be aware that they have moved into a position where they are no longer to receive Austudy from the date of that change in their enrolment. From that date, they are no longer eligible to receive the Austudy payments and a repayment is required of them. The three months in which they are to make the repayment of that amount starts at that time. At the end of the three months they may well have a continuing period arising from their appeal. But, in any event, the interest rate begins only after those two buffer periods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I received a letter from the South Australian President of the National Union of Students. Being a South Australian and having been a student at the University of Adelaide and an adviser to students&mdash;in fact, I was responsible for student services at the university&mdash;I give very real attention to such a letter. The letter says that we should knock out this 20 per cent interest charge. It gives examples of the kinds of reasons why overpayments arise. The second paragraph of Carla Stacey's letter of today's date states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overpayments of AUSTUDY are a result of either a bureaucratic mistake in the amount eligible for a recipient or an AUSTUDY recipient failing to indicate a change in financial situation.</PARA>
<PARA>I honestly say to my good friend Carla Stacey, and to any other students, that these are two of the lesser reasons for there being an overpayment under Austudy. I ask them to reconsider it and more comprehensively address the kinds of circumstances that lead to overpayment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it were only what was said in this letter&mdash;that this was the result of bureaucratic mistakes and, as such, students will get 20 per cent interest penalties&mdash;I can imagine the storm of protest that may have excited students in campuses as they gathered in various demonstrations around the country today. It is wrong of the National Union of Students to misrepresent the situation to students and it is counterproductive vis-a-vis their credibility if they move the Government or next year's government&mdash;the Liberal-National Party government&mdash;to rightly respond to those credible requests that are to be made for improvement of the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me refer to two other matters. One is the approach of the Democrats generally in this area, which I do not accept, and the other is the improvements to Austudy that the Liberal and National parties have already announced as part of the Fightback package. It has now become well-known in this chamber that the Liberal and National parties will, on coming to office, spend more than $3 billion of additional money on tertiary, secondary and primary education. A considerable proportion of that additional $3 billion for new education programs will be spent on students who are receiving Austudy, both at the tertiary and secondary level. All educational services will be free of the goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the higher education contribution scheme will be retained. There will be an increase in the discount for that portion which is eventually subject to HECS and which can be avoided by an upfront payment. Under the present Government, there is a 15 per cent discount if the HECS liability is avoided by an upfront payment. We will increase that discount to 25 per cent. It will give a genuine benefit to many students who will take the option of paying upfront that portion of what is required of them for their academic enrolment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will review the student assistance arrangements to ensure that assistance is provided equitably and that no-one is shut out of higher education purely on financial grounds. I repeat: a guiding light of the approach of the Liberal and National parties is to have an Austudy scheme which ensures that nobody is shut out of higher education purely on financial grounds. We will better target Austudy by including only those receivers of it who are eligible for $30 a week or more. The actual benefit under Austudy will increase by 6 per cent, which will occur automatically at the time of the introduction of the new taxation arrangements, targeted for 1 October, 1994. This increase in Austudy amounts exceeds the 4.4 per cent increase in costs estimated to flow from the introduction of a GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not take the time of the Senate now to reiterate the more substantial matters which relate to the higher education system or to schools and which affect the receivers of Austudy. But, in broad, we will give complete freedom. We will return autonomy to the education institutions of Australia. We will stop the bureaucratic monopolies of decision-making that have been arrogated by the Labor Government in Canberra and that have been a block to so many good initiatives that otherwise would have happened at the local institutional level for the benefit of students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the context of Senator Sowada's remarks. Senator Sowada has a genuine interest in education and the well-being of students. So do we all. I do not think Senator Sowada will be offended when I say that she comes from a bleeding hearts party&mdash;a party that wants to greatly increase social welfare payments, greatly increase research commitments, greatly increase overseas aid, greatly cut the tax on low income receivers, abolish payroll taxes&mdash;which we will achieve next year in conjunction with the States&mdash;and not just knock off a 20 per cent interest rate on penalties for Austudy overpayments, but give Austudy to every student. Every single student would qualify for the full amount; there would be no targeting on the basis of family incomes. The Democrats want to give Austudy to everybody. They want to make sure that it is increased to 120 per cent of the poverty line, and that it is indexed. This is the bleeding hearts party of the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the context in which Senator Sowada wants to see 20 per cent lopped off the penalty on overpayments. Let me tell the Senate what it would cost to do just those few things that the Democrats have promised. To see the tax threshold indexed to inflation and increased to at least the poverty line will cost $10 billion. Where will that come from? The Democrats want to increase the funding for national research to 2 per cent of gross domestic product. That will cost $4.5 billion.

The Department was criticised for not implementing the penalty provisions relating to debts. The regulation that is the subject of debate this evening is a regulation that will apply to those who are not paying their debts promptly.

That point needs to be made in this debate because it was not recognised sufficiently by Senator Sowada.

So the regulation is not as stringent, not as hard, as the Democrats would have it appear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we have fixed on 20 per cent is that what the Government recognises is needed here and what the Opposition also recognises is needed here is a powerful inducement to encourage former clients of the Department to repay their overpayments promptly. There are mechanisms in place&mdash;there are pressure valves&mdash;to ensure that those suffering hardship and those who do pay are not penalised. However, it is important to ensure that there is a powerful inducement in the process. It should be recognised that the 20 per cent rate of interest is consistent with the charge that applies to taxpayers with outstanding liabilities to the Commissioner of Taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on the Government side say that there needs to be a powerful inducement. That has been recognised by the Australian National Audit Office. The inducement has to be 20 per cent. That is consistent with other inducements, such as  in the taxpaying area. We also ask the Senate to recognise that there are mechanisms to ensure that those suffering hardship or who do pay their debts or arrange to pay their debts will not incur that 20 per cent inducement to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate has gone on long enough. I do not really need to go into a whole litany about the assistance that has been provided in this area, whether by way of assistance to students or by way of funding the education process. In an effort to wind up this debate quickly, I indicate that the Government does not support the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue boils down to whether we judge the 20 per cent that is now in the regulations and which we seek to disallow to be a just interest rate to apply to overpayments and to impose on the students. That is really what it boils down to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question also is: who will pay that money? It may well be the student. The student normally, under those circumstances, does not have the money to pay for it. The obligation to pay then goes back to the parents. They are the ones who, all along the line, have been disadvantaged by a number of government decisions in the last seven or eight years&mdash;even further back. The position is that an unjustifiably heavy tax burden is placed on those parents who are keeping their sons and daughters at university without any assistance or with minimal assistance from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take issue here with a point made in the Chapman report. The Chapman report, which was referred to by Senator Teague, indicates that the most important consideration for an income support scheme which is designed to remove financial barriers to participation in education by the disadvantaged lies in ensuring that the right amount of support goes to the right people. Although I have not completely read this paper&mdash;it came into my possession only today&mdash;the point is that that is only one aspect. It is true that it is a very important aspect but it is only one. It does not go to the question of horizontal tax equity; that is, tax equity for those families at whatever level of income who have sons and daughters going through universities and whose university related expenses are paid for by those families. Compare such a family with another family whose sons and daughters are not going through university and therefore does not have the burden of paying for fees, books, transport and so on. To be quite frank, that is an issue which has to be considered and faced up to, but it is not being faced up to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before 1976 one could claim a taxation deduction in respect of the expenditure from the family income on the education of one's sons and daughters. Now one cannot. It can be done by a company, it can be done by a business, but the most important business in Australia, families, cannot claim. I agree that, under the particular rules, if there is an overpayment there should be an incentive for it to be paid back. Creating the incentive surely is action that can be taken by the Government for crying out loud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the House of Representatives standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Student Financial Assistance</EMPHASIS> at page 74 talked about benefits control units being established by DEET across Australia. What are the benefits control units doing? The report then indicated on that same page what is proposed to be done by the benefits control units. It is their job to get the money back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a particular rate is to be levied in respect of that particular overpayment, it should be made a reasonable rate, on the basis of justice, not on the basis of incentive. The incentive, surely, should apply to the benefits control units, in terms of getting the money back. Indeed, I am not so sure that the description of the situation given by the Minister and by Senator Teague is adequate. I am not saying that what they said is incorrect, but the overall rate for underpayments as I have it in the tax rates and tables 1991-92&mdash;that is, the underpayments by the taxpayer to the Taxation department, which is the equivalent of overpayments by DEET to students&mdash;appears to be 14.026 per cent. Of course, even that figure is well above the commercial rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us agree to and fix a just rate rather than have this very severe penalty rate of 20 per cent applying across the board to all students to whom overpayments have been made for a range of reasons. It comes down to whether or not one considers 20 per cent too high. In my view, 20 per cent is too high. It is not just. I support the motion for disallowance as moved by Senator Sowada. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I wish briefly to exercise my right of reply on this issue, especially after listening to Senator Teague's rather gratuitous criticisms of various aspects of Democrat policy. It is quite clear that he had not read the Chapman report in any detail. If he had, he would have noted that one of Chapman's recommendations was that Austudy be indexed to the CPI. He would also have noted that Chapman himself noted that Austudy is below the dole. What incentive is there for students to continue their education when they can in fact receive a higher level of benefits on the dole? On those two elements alone, it is clear Senator Teague is simply talking off the top of his head. Quite clearly he had received the report only this afternoon and had not had a chance to read it in detail. Certainly Chapman himself recognises that the inadequacy of current Austudy benefits is a major problem and is a disincentive for many students to continue their education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus referred to criticism about DEET and its administration in respect of Austudy. It is well known that DEET has been very heavily criticised for its administration of Austudy, for the fact that many students receive overpayments to which they are not entitled, and for the fact that many aspects of student requests for changes to their benefits take a long time to feed through the system. It is not only simply a matter of students failing in their responsibilities but also a problem of administration in DEET which has been recognised by the Auditor-General and by this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague also mentioned Democrat policy in relation to a significant increase in funds for research activity. I think it would be widely recognised by higher education institutions, by business and, in fact, by this Government that there must be a significant increase in Australia's research and development activities if it is to become internationally competitive. It is absolutely critical that we develop new technologies, that we develop market niches and that we can hold our heads high on the international stage as our markets for our traditional exports fall and as income from those exports falls. We must significantly increase research activity for high-tech products. If Senator Teague believes that this is an inappropriate activity for universities and for business to be engaged in, he is obviously not in touch with what is going on in the marketplace and with what Australia needs to become internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is worth noting that the Korean Government has recently announced that it will fund environmental technologies and environmental waste management technologies to the tune of over $700m. That is a significant public investment directly into an area of technology which will yield significant benefits to that country over a long period. We will be left behind if we simply believe that Australia can carry on its merry way by simply ripping minerals out of the ground, ripping wool off the sheep's back and continuing to grow wheat and so forth. We must become internationally competitive by improving our technological base and using the intellects that we know we have in Australia's scientific community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should also look at what the Opposition plans to do to education. This is a very important point because Senator Teague referred to a number of elements of the Democrat policy. He said that we were being populist. Senator Teague is obviously not aware that his own Party's policies are in fact not widely supported within the academic community and especially amongst students. The Opposition has every reason to be extremely concerned about its education policies and how they may well be received over the coming 12 months. Once the people of Australia find out what those policies will actually do, I think they will be extremely worried about the prospect of a coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that the Opposition proposes fees for university courses. It proposes to introduce student vouchers. There will be a set amount of money for a student to be able to go along to an institution and enrol in whichever course they choose, and then universities will be allowed to charge a fee in addition to that voucher. It is worth noting that we have seen significant deregulation of course fees for postgraduate study. In the past 12 months we have seen universities take advantage of and grasp in both hands this deregulatory mechanism that has been offered to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has in fact happened is that, for a variety of course work programs at various institutions which will involve postgraduate degrees to help people improve their professional qualifications, many institutions have chosen to charge most exorbitant rates for those courses. For example, an institution in Melbourne now charges $26,000 for an MBA program. That is under this Government's current policies. I ask you, Mr Deputy President, to consider what would happen under the Opposition's policies if this particular method of deregulation was extended across the entire university system and applied to undergraduate degrees as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The AVCC has said that it is extremely concerned about the kind of mechanism that this would introduce into tertiary institutions in Australia. We could see the cost of a medical degree reaching the level of $130,000, given the fact that it is a five year degree and given the level of capital works and the level of equipment that is needed for degrees of that nature. We could find that many degrees such as medicine, veterinary science and other science degrees become totally out of reach for the average Australian simply because universities took advantage of market driven policies. That would price many courses out of the reach of average students. It is quite clear that many of the Opposition's education policies are not widely supported. People are very concerned about them. The Opposition will have a great deal of difficulty in trying to sell an education policy to the electorate where excellence in education actually equals elitism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To get back to the Austudy motion for disallowance, which is what this debate is actually about, I reiterate that the Democrats do not object to the notion of charging an interest rate for a late repayment of an Austudy overpayment, but we do object to punitive interest rates and an interest rate that bears no relationship to the current level of market rates. For example, Senator Teague referred to much higher interest rates applicable in tax legislation, and certainly that is very true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seek to clarify my earlier comments in relation to tax. I mentioned earlier a tax Bill that is currently being considered by this House&mdash;the Taxation Laws Amendment (Self-Assessment) Bill 1992&mdash;which was introduced into the Parliament this week. This legislation actually reforms the legislative penalties and differentiates between the types of actions resulting in the underpayment of tax, remembering of course that the underpayment of tax is equivalent to an Austudy overpayment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular legislation provides for a dichotomous system consisting of separate penalty provisions and separate interest provisions; that is, a system that deliberately takes into account the circumstances leading to the underpayment of tax and imposes penalties according to the actions of the taxpayer. Where there is no fault on behalf of the taxpayer there is no penal component, although there is an interest component. Where the taxpayer is at fault there is a penal charge plus interest imposed. This differentiation is supported by the Democrats and we ask the Government why it does not institute a similar system for Austudy. Notwithstanding this superior system, the tax legislation I have cited also proposes to change the existing interest rate component which will be charged at 4 per cent above the Government's short term borrowing rate. That change to the interest rate for tax underpayments is currently before the Parliament and will in fact reduce the level of interest payable to tax underpayments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ask the Government why it is, on the one hand, introducing a piece of legislation which will affect the interest rate on this aspect of the tax system and, on the other hand, introducing a punitive 20 per cent tax rate for Austudy overpayments. It is a totally inconsistent position that, once again, we have seen the Government put before this Parliament. We are not saying to the Government, `Simply disallow this regulation and let us have a zero interest component on Austudy overpayments'. We are saying, `Go back to the drawing board and have another think about this in light of legislation you are currently passing and come up with something more reasonable'. I commend my motion of disallowance to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major part of this Bill is to provide for amendments to legislation for the wool industry. The amendments relate specifically to the Australian Wool Corporation Act 1991 (the AWC Act), the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Act 1991 the (AWRC Act), and the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 (PIERD Act).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, as part of the overall package of changes to the wool industry legislation, proposed amendments to the Wool Tax (Administration) Act 1964, and to the Wool Tax Acts (Nos 1-5)1964, will be introduced separately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary purpose of the package of amendments to the wool legislation is to provide mechanisms for distributing surplus Australian Wool Realisation Commission (AWRC) funds to wool growers and to introduce more flexibility into the current debt reduction arrangements. Both of these initiatives were recently announced in the `One Nation' statement. The package will also provide for other relatively minor amendments to the wool industry legislation, most of which are at the request of those involved in aspects of its administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the wool industry represents yet another case which clearly demonstrates this Government's capacity to work with industry to develop sound public policy. The Government's position has always been clear: we will accept advice from a variety of sources, we will consult with the industry and jointly develop a policy base that will take those industries forward. What we have also made clear is that we will not be driven by ideological approaches that fail to recognise the concerns and requirements of industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, Honourable Senators will be aware of the radical changes to the statutory industry framework and marketing arrangements for wool which came into effect in July last year. The new statutory authorities (the Australian Wool Realisation Commission (AWRC), the new Australian Wool Corporation (AWC), and the Wool R&amp;D Corporation (WRDC) have taken up their respective roles with enthusiasm and commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AWRC, in particular, has a significant challenge in selling the stockpile and discharging the industry debt. At the same time it must have regard for the overall impact of its activities on the market. While ever there is a large stockpile there is a potential for that stockpile to overhang the market in such a way as to create uncertainty and affect demand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Twelve months ago the stockpile stood at 4.7 million bales and the debt was around $2.7 billion. At the time we expected that the AWRC would only be able to pay off a small amount of the debt in 1991/92 and the debt schedule therefore set the repayment target for the year at $20 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since July the AWRC has been affected by a range of factors combining to enable it to achieve a higher income from sales from its stockpile of wool than was anticipated at the start of the season. The reasons for this include lower levels of wool production, the quality of the wool in the stockpile being different to recent drought affected production, increased demand for stocks to replenish the wool processing pipeline, and higher prices than expected. As a result, the AWRC is now well ahead of its required debt repayment target for this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To build on that better than expected outcome for the AWRC, the Government decided it was appropriate to change the AWRC debt reduction schedule from an annual to a cumulative basis as announced in the `One Nation' statement. This provision will give the AWRC more flexibility in adjusting its operations to market conditions. In the event of a market downturn the flexibility to pay off more debt in some years will give it the capacity to pay off less if returns are lower in others. It will however, need to ensure that the maximum debt balances at the end of each year do not exceed the limits set within the cumulative debt schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is possible in some years that funds might be generated by the AWRC which are not prudently required for the debt repayment program. Therefore, recognising that most growers are currently receiving low incomes, the Government believes that a way is needed to distribute to growers any such surplus funds generated by the AWRC. In the `One Nation' statement it was indicated that any surplus funds not prudently required by the AWRC may be used as a rebate to growers in the form of a cash payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the government also gave a commitment to consult with the wool industry on the distribution of such funds to growers. Following those constructive discussions and with the agreement of the Wool Council, I announced in April that I propose to use any surplus funds generated by the AWRC during the current year as a rebate against the wool tax in 1992-93. My intention is that this will enable a reduction in the effective rate of the tax for next season while maintaining the prescribed rate of the tax at the existing 12 per cent. The Wool Council support this position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments proposed in the Bill will provide the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy with the flexibility to distribute surplus AWRC funds as a rebate of wool tax, as a cash payment to wool tax payers, or to determine that the surplus should remain in the Stockpile Fund to pay off more debt. A determination would be made after the Minister had been advised by the AWRC if it holds surplus funds which are not required for the prudent management of the debt repayment program and the operation of the Stockpile Fund. Before making a decision, the Minister will be required to consult with the Wool Council of Australia about the distribution of the surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I am optimistic about the future for wool. However, it is difficult to accurately predict what the market might do in the years ahead and therefore whether the AWRC will generate a surplus in future years. I am particularly mindful to also ensure that the objective to prudently manage the debt and stockpile sales must remain clear and uncompromised. To this end I will continue to strongly resist calls for a reduction in the overall prescribed wool tax rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not believe, on the basis of one year's performance, that it would be prudent to lower the prescribed rate of tax at this time. To do that might result in having to put the tax rate up again in a later year if the market suffers a downturn. The Wool Council of Australia endorses this position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The level of the tax rebate to apply in 1992-93 will be decided in June this year and I will be considering the advice I receive from the AWRC on the size of the surplus when making that decision. I will also be consulting with Wool Council on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, as I mentioned earlier, this Bill also contains a number of other amendments which have been made at the request of the AWC, the AWRC and the Australian Wool Industry Council (AWIC) in the light of experience with the legislation to date. Generally these amendments are intended to fine-tune some of the administrative provisions. Three of them warrant some explanatory comment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AWC has requested modifications to the way in which the register of wool tax payers entitled to vote at general meetings, is maintained. The proposed amendments will provide for grower registration and voting entitlements to be specified in a 3 year rolling register. Growers will be able to update their details each year if they wish. If they considered that the details previously provided were still relevant, then their entry on the register would be maintained for 3 years. In making these changes, the administration of the register will be simplified, and growers will be relieved of the annual requirement to make a formal application to be registered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well, an addition is proposed to the types of motions which can be put and voted on at an AWC annual general meeting. Under the current legislation woolgrowers are unable to put forward motions on general business matters within the AWC's responsibilities. The proposed amendment will mean greater accountability between woolgrowers and the AWC by allowing a wider range of motions to be debated and voted upon.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to ensure that the AWRC has the appropriate and well defined powers to deal in hedging has been requested by them following discussions with financial institutions and in the light of legal advice. The changes will ensure that the Commission has the commercial flexibility which is consistent with its functions. The proposed changes are similar to recently made provisions for other statutory authorities and in essence, ensure that the AWRC has the power to use hedging contracts to manage risks of variations in the cost of borrowings as well as risks of adverse variations in foreign currency transactions. In addition the AWRC will be able to use hedging to manage returns on investments. Similar amendments have also been made to the AWC legislation at the request of the AWC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the request of the Australian Wool Industry Council (AWIC) an amendment has been made to the AWC Act to provide additional flexibility in the registration authority for wool sampling sites, testing laboratories and showfloors. Currently the National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) is the sole registration authority. The proposed amendment will provide for the possibility that an alternative registration authority to NATA may be prescribed at some time in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some minor amendments have also been made to the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 (the PIERD Act). These amendments are required as a consequence of amendments made to the AWC Act regarding the establishment and maintenance of a register of woolgrowers for the purposes of voting at an annual general meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of the proposed amendments which make up the package of changes to the wool legislation are responsible decisions which fine tune the statutory arrangements and show that the Government is sensitive to ensuring there is an appropriate and flexible framework for the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments to this Act are to rectify minor anomalies concerning the allowing of minimum quantity or minimum monetary levels for small producers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In most levy or export charge schemes about 85% of levy income is paid by only 15% of the levy payer population, whereas 40 to 50% of the population would pay less than the limits proposed. The intention is to allow small producers a threshold before having to pay levy. Once the threshold is reached, levy would become payable on the total quantity or amount. The basis for setting the threshold is not linked to the actual levy rates but is related to the estimated collection cost per levy return. These provisions will permit different thresholds to be prescribed for future levy years according to changing economic circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With full cost recovery for levy collections operating since 1988-1989 there has been increasing pressure from participating industries for more economical collection techniques to be adopted by the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures have the support of participating industries. As there are no changes proposed to the operative rates of levy or export charge in this Bill there will be no net effect to revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Snowy Mountain Hydro-electric Power Act 1949</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to this Act increases the Ministerial contract approval level from $0.5 to $2 million. It empowers the Authority to enter into contracts valued under $2 million without the requirement to obtain prior Ministerial approval for each contract up to this level.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">COAL MINING INDUSTRY (LONG SERVICE LEAVE FUNDING) BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Bills form an important part of the Government's Coal Industry Reform Package.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They provide for the amendment and (ultimately) the repeal of the States Grants (Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave) Act 1949 which, together with complementary state legislation, establish the present scheme for the funding of long service leave in the black coal mining industry in New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current scheme is funded by way of an excise on coal production levied at 20 cents per tonne. Under the proposed arrangements, long service leave will be funded by a levy on payroll.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new scheme has been agreed to by the relevant states and all elements in the industry affected have been consulted in relation to the proposed reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 2 December 1991 the Government announced a range of initiatives in relation to the coal industry. These were announced in the Government's coal industry policy statement jointly issued by the Minister for Industrial Relations and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The statement presents the most far-reaching changes to coal industry policy since the immediate post-war period. Reform of the industry's long service leave arrangements is part of those initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The policy statement followed a review of long service leave funding undertaken by Mr L J Willett, then chairperson of the superannuation fund investment trust, and was delivered to the Minister for Industrial Relations in November 1990. The report recommended changes to the present funding scheme. It also proposed that the scheme should be fully funded so as to facilitate the portability of long service leave in the industry and to ensure the preservation of benefits in the event of companies going out of business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees with the general thrust of Mr Willett's report and believes that responsibility for administering the fund should be returned to the industry. It recognises, however, that in the short run this may impose significant cost burdens on sections of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Existing arrangements have operated on a "pay as you go" basis, and a substantial unfunded liability for long service leave has accrued. Moreover, large scale, highly productive producers (largely represented by the Queensland Mining Council) raised concerns that they presently cross-subsidise the operations of more labour intensive mines, predominantly the underground coal mining industry in NSW.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In commenting on the Willett report's recommendations, industry parties and State Governments agreed that outstanding liabilities and future accruals should be funded on a more equitable and rational basis related to employment costs. The Government believes that the new arrangements safeguard the public interest in maintaining a viable coal mining industry whilst representing an appropriate balance between the principles of efficiency and equity and the interests of the disparate parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bills terminate the present excise funding arrangement and implement a new industry-managed fully funded scheme. With the co-operation of the States, it is envisaged that the new funding arrangements will become fully operational from 1 January 1993. The principal features of the scheme are as follows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is to be a single national scheme under Commonwealth legislation, and its management is to be the responsibility of a board of directors made up of employer and union representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation will establish a Coal Mining Industry (long service leave funding) Corporation. The corporation will be wholly self financing and will have two functions. The first will be to manage the Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave Trust Fund for the purpose of reimbursing participating companies for long service leave taken by coal miners and other eligible employees. The second will be to collect levies from companies for the purpose of funding long service leave and meeting the costs of the corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The corporation will be constituted by a board of six directors whom the Minister for Industrial Relations will appoint and who will hold office on a part time basis. The Minister will appoint two of the directors to represent the companies engaged in black coal mining in New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania, and one director to represent companies engaged in black coal mining in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister will appoint one director to represent the United Mine Worker's Division of the Construction, Forestry and Mining Employees' Union, and one director to represent:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.The Electrical Trades Union of Australia;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.The Federated Engine Drivers' and Firemen's Association of Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.The Metals and Engineering Workers' Union.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another director is to represent:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.The Australian Collieries Staff Association;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.The Colliery Officials Association of New South Wales; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.The New South Wales Mine Managers Association.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the first instance, the Minister will appoint one of the directors to be chairperson of the board and another to be deputy chairperson. Subsequent appointments of chairperson and deputy chairperson will be made by the board. The directors' remuneration will be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The corporation will have all powers necessary to carry out the functions I have described. It will have the power to enter into contracts, including contracts with other organisations to collect levies, manage funds and make payments in relation to long service leave on behalf of the corporation. It will have the power to invest moneys so as to maximise the return on funds in the interests of contributors, to borrow moneys subject to ministerial approval, and to employ staff and engage consultants under terms and conditions determined by the board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheme is to be independently reviewed at regular intervals and once it is fully funded responsibility for its operation will be devolved to the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Assets and liabilities of the existing fund are to be transferred to the new scheme and the legislation provides that the rate of levy is to be prescribed by the Minister acting on the advice of the board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The levy is to be collected from participating companies only, with the formula for reimbursement set to reflect national minimum industry standards in respect of long service leave. Claims for reimbursement may be made in relation to all award-based entitlements payable during long service leave (including production-related bonuses).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reimbursement may also be claimed where an obligation to pay long service leave arises from any, or any combination of, the following:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;A certified agreement under made under relevant State or Federal Legislation</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;An agreement registered or approved by a specified industrial authority (this includes any relevant enterprise agreement that may be made under the New South Wales Industrial Relations Act 1991); and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;An individual contract of employment which attracts the requisite entitlement to long service leave.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that paragraph (b) the definition of "eligible employee" in clause 4 makes it plain that payments made to a number of employees who are "award free" will also be covered by the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the erroneous comments made by the opposition spokesperson on industrial relations in another place, I would also like to make it abundantly clear that the funding arrangements do not discriminate between unionists and non unionists. Union membership is simply not a criteria for determining whether a person is to be regarded as an "eligible employee" for the purposes of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For constitutional reasons it has not been possible to cover certain non award-based entitlements payable in certain states or by individual firms by tailoring the rate of levy to the circumstances in each participating state. There is nothing, however, in the scheme to prevent firms paying higher long service leave benefits where they see fit. In such cases they will not be able to claim reimbursement from the fund for payments in excess of normal entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since this Bill was introduced in another place, representations have been received from the New South Wales Coal Association and the Queensland Mining Council about the meaning of the words used in paragraph (b) of the definition of "eligible employee" in clause 4.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The paragraph is co-extensive with five other paragraphs in clause 4 which together provide the basis for determining which employees in the Black Coal Mining Industry are to be covered by the National Scheme for securing funding of long service leave entitlements in the industry. Here, I note in passing, that the legislation does not itself create an entitlement to long service leave. The legislation merely provides for the creation of the fund upon which employers will be able, as the need arises, to draw to obtain reimbursement for payments made to eligible employees in respect of long service leave entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concern has been expressed that the absence of the words "in the Black Coal Mining Industry" from the definition of eligible employee in paragraph (b) may be construed as having the effect of widening the definition to include persons not presently covered under long standing arrangements within the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not the intended effect of the legislation. The words already appearing in paragraph in question, when read together with the objects of the act, which are set out in clause 3 of the legislation, limit the classes of worker who may be regarded as "eligible employees" for the purposes of the act to persons employed in the Black Coal Mining Industry. The addition of the words "in the Black Coal Mining Industry" to paragraph (b) accordingly serves no useful purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government wishes to make it clear it is not its intention to extend the coverage of the scheme beyond persons who are currently regarded as being engaged in the Black Coal Mining Industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What may be described as the "boundaries" of the Black Coal Mining Industry vary within and between states and are to a significant extent determined by custom and practice reflecting a range of considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill accordingly provides for a means including or excluding limited numbers of workers from the scheme (but not from entitlements to long service leave) by regulation as is provided for under paragraphs (d) and (f) of clause 4. The Government will, reflecting the provisions of the legislation and the co-operative nature of the scheme, consult with representatives of all interests likely to be affected by the making of any such regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will allow the industry some flexibility in regulating its affairs, whilst safeguards to protect the interests of any individuals who may be affected are retained as regulations made in respect of the coverage of the scheme will, of course, be disallowable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is envisaged that the scheme is to be fully funded over a period of ten years including the unfunded liability for leave accrued prior 1 January 1993. Presently, it is estimated the initial levy will be in the vicinity of 6 per cent of payroll. The actual rate of levy will be precisely determined by an actuarial review conducted under the auspices of the corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have already indicated, there are compelling reasons for continuing government involvement through a statutory corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the new arrangements will substantially increase long service leave funding costs for many companies, especially by reason of the requirement to fully fund accrued liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The formation of a statutory corporation, rather than a private company, has enabled company income tax deductibility of contributions to the fund. The rates of payroll levy that are required to finance ongoing accruals of long service leave and to fund the accrued liability will impose significantly increased cost burdens on the industry. These rates of levy will, for some companies, equate to a cost of about 60 or 70 cents per tonne compared with the present 20 cents per tonne. The burden will fall most heavily on relatively labour intensive mines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the potential cost impact of the new arrangements on sections of the industry, particularly the requirement to achieve full funding, it is appropriate that the tax treatment of levy contributions to the new scheme should be as favourable as the tax treatment of payments under the current excise funding arrangements. As excise payments are deductible for company income tax purposes it is anticipated that there will be no additional cost to revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision of tax deductibility for levy contributions also recognises that unlike most other employers, coal companies are being compelled to contribute to a long service leave fund. Other employers who make provision for their long service leave liabilities in the normal way retain the funds so provided as internal working capital. Deductibility of contributions will help offset the cost of replacing that working capital.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the new long service leave scheme removes the inefficiencies and inequities associated with the present arrangements, and its full funding will ensure the portability and preservation of benefits. It is an important complementary component of the Government's Coal Industry Policy Reforms, which are designed to respond to changed circumstances and help secure the industry's future into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, continuing Commonwealth involvement provides a guarantee of continuity and for a smooth transition to the privately funded scheme (or schemes) with a minimum of industrial friction.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">COAL RESEARCH ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to transfer responsibility for coal research and development in Australia from a Commonwealth Government-run system to an industry funded and managed scheme. This new arrangement was announced by the Government on 2 December 1991 as part of a major package of institutional reform in the coal industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal Commonwealth Government mechanism for directing and coordinating energy research and development has been the National Energy Research Development and Demonstration Council. Coal research has been funded through the National Energy Research Development and Demonstration Council by the Coal Research Trust Account which was established by the Coal Research Assistance Act 1977.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current funding arrangements for the Coal Research Trust Account is through the collection of a 5c per tonne excise on black coal production by the Excise Tariff Act 1921.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new coal research and development (R &amp; D) arrangements had their origins following a review of all Commonwealth-funded research arrangements within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy conducted in 1989. The aim of the Review was to define improvements which could be made to ensure that research programs continued to produce results that are relevant to industry requirements. A statutory research and development corporation model was chosen and has been adopted in most cases, however the coal industry opted to administer its own research and development.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">COAL TARIFF LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to repeal the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Act 1975 and to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 which will put in place the reform measures for the coal sector announced by this Government on 2 December 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the reform measures announced by the Government is the abolition of the Coal Export Duty. The duty was originally introduced in the early 1970s as a tax on windfall profits. Over the years the duty was modified and at present, coal which remains dutiable is high quality coking coal mined from depths no greater than 60 metres in open-cut mines which were in production before 30 June 1980. In practice, the duty affects six open-cut mines in Queensland operated by BHP Australia Coal Limited. This Government acknowledges that the duty is an anomaly in the current coal industry tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has therefore agreed to repeal the Coal Export Duty in return for BHP's commitment to invest $248 million in new capital expenditure, enhanced research and development and additional coal mine rehabilitation activities over the next five years. The program of commitments by BHP will have significant efficiency gains, improve regional employment opportunities and provide environmental benefits for Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commitments will also add to the competitiveness of export operations of Australian coal at a time when Australia needs to explore all avenues of improved export performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government's decision to abolish the duty as part of a package of micro-economic reform for the Australian coal industry underpins the facilitating role this Government is prepared to play in working with industry to overcome sectoral impediments and promote industry development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill also amends the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to give effect to the Government's decision to reform the coal research and development arrangements and coalminers' long service leave arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth excise of 5 cents per tonne on coal produced which currently funds the Coal Research Trust Account to the value of around $8 million, will be  suspended. The remaining Commonwealth excise of 20 cents per tonne on coal produced, which currently funds coalminers' long service leave will continue until a new payroll levy based scheme comes into effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a potential loss of gross revenue from abolition of the Coal Export Duty of $44.8 million in 1992-93 and $40.5 million in 1993-94. Suspension of the levy for research and development and the ultimate abolition of the long service leave levy will reduce Commonwealth receipts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislation providing for the establishment of an industry-based coal research and development arrangement and a new national scheme for coalminers' long service leave are being introduced into the Senate as part of the Government's coal industry policy reform package.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to honourable senators and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">COAL INDUSTRY AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to reform the functions and activities of the Joint Coal Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This reform measure is part of a package of major policy reform measures for the coal sector announced by this Government on 2 December 1991. The aims of the reform package are to promote growth, employment and investment in the industry through the removal of unnecessary impediments to growth and change. The other reform measures to be considered by Parliament are :</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;a new industry-based coal research and development arrangement;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;a new national scheme for coalminers' long service leave; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;abolition of the Coal Export Duty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will give effect to the Government's decision to refocus the functions and activities of the Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Board was established under Commonwealth and New South Wales Coal Industry Acts of 1946. The New South Wales Government will be introducing its parallel bill to the State Parliament in the current Parliamentary session.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time that it was established, the Board was given extensive powers over industry development, mining, employment, and marketing to ensure adequate coal supplies in the post-war reconstruction era. Many of these powers have long since been unnecessary, and unused. The New South Wales coal industry has undergone extensive changes since 1947, moving from a domestic oriented industry to a premier coal exporter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In October 1990, the Commonwealth and New South Wales Governments engaged Mr Bryan Kelman to undertake an independent review of the powers, functions and activities of the Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Based on Mr Kelman's review and subsequent consultations with industry parties and the Construction, Forestry and Mining Employees Union, both the Commonwealth and New South Wales Governments agreed that the Board's functions and activities would be rationalised and refocussed to concentrate on those areas where it has a demonstrated  record of performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to refocus the Board's powers and role in the industry will remove unnecessary duplication of functions between the Board and the State department responsible for mining matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for the Board to continue its powers, functions and activities in the following areas :</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. administration of the Coal Industry Workers' Compensation scheme;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. provision of coalminers' occupational health and rehabilitation services, including the provision of preventive medical services, monitoring workers' health and investigating related health matters;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. promotion of the welfare of current and former workers in the industry, their families and communities in the coal mining areas;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. collection, collation and dissemination of accident and other statistics related to the health and welfare of workers engaged in the coal industry;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. provision of advice and information to Ministers and others on coalminers' health and welfare;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. report to Ministers and the Chief Inspector of Coal Mines as it thinks fit on matters of safety;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. provision of international training/educational courses in coal under the auspices of the Australian aid program and international development agencies; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. collection of industry statistics until such time as both the Commonwealth and State Ministers otherwise direct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Board will also continue to monitor, promote and specify adequate training standards relating to health and safety for mineworkers until such time as effective alternative arrangements are operating to the satisfaction of portfolio Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both Governments have recognised the very valuable work which the Board has done in relation to coalminers' health and welfare. The Board will therefore continue to monitor dust levels until the industry parties can satisfy Ministers with portfolio responsibility that there are suitable and effective alternative arrangements which may warrant a transfer of this function.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of the Bill is to remove unnecessary duplication of functions between the Board and the State, and to bring to an end the Board's powers, functions and activities in a number of areas, namely :</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;control over the rate of development of the coal industry in New South Wales, particularly attempts to match supply and demand; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;coal resource utilisation, mining, marketing and management issues within the State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Future Board membership will formalise the current arrangement which is, an independent Chairperson, an employees' representative and an employers' representative. However, the terms of appointment will be changed. The Act provides for a maximum term of appointment of seven years on a full-time basis for all Board members. The Bill will amend this to a maximum of three years on either a full-time or part-time basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As it stands now, policy direction to the Board can only be issued from the Prime Minister in agreement with the Premier of New South Wales. The Bill will place the Board under the direct control of both Commonwealth and State portfolio Ministers responsible for the coal industry. Provisions have been made in the Bill to improve the Board's standards of accountability in line with contemporary practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1992/93, the Board will become largely self-funding for its continuing operations. The workers' compensation insurance, health, and welfare activities will be funded from existing resources accumulated by the Board and from future premium and other income. The other functions will be operated on a cost recovery basis. In 1991/92, the Commonwealth share for the Board's operations is $2.463M. This includes funding for the Coal Industry Tribunal which has previously been provided through the Board. Funding for the Coal Industry Tribunal will continue, and is estimated at $570,000 for 1992/93.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reforms to the Joint Coal Board embodied in this Bill ensure continuation of its high standard of delivery of services to employees in the New South Wales coal industry. The health and welfare of industry employees will in no way be compromised by this reform. Both Governments believe that the elimination of overlap with State activities and bringing the operations of the Board into sharper focus will assist the efficient operation of the State's most important export industry.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill 1992 is to amend section 37 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 to allow the chairman and other members of the Authority to be re-appointed, up to a maximum period of appointment of four years. At present, while all categories of members of the Authority may be initially appointed for up to a maximum period of four years, only a member appointed for the purpose of dealing with a particular reference or references, may be re-appointed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its report "Who is to Guard the Guards?", the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority recommended, at paragraph 3.89, that the Government should ensure that the terms of appointment of members allow for an overlap of membership and that a complete change of membership of the Authority at one time be avoided. The Government can act to implement this recommendation by taking account of it when making appointments and determining length of appointment. However the current situation facing the Authority shows that there is a need for greater flexibility in the legislation controlling appointments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Justice Phillips resigned his position as Chairman of the National Crime Authority on 17 December 1991 to take up his appointment as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria. Mr Tom Sherman took up the position of Chairman on 26 February 1992. In accordance with section 7 of the Act the Authority has two other members (Mr Greg Cusack QC based in Sydney and Mr Julian Leckie based in Melbourne) and one member specially appointed in relation to particular references (Mr Malcolm Gray QC based in Adelaide). The terms of appointment for Mr Cusack QC and Mr Leckie end on 30 June 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would create serious problems for the Authority to lose both Mr Cusack QC and Mr Leckie on 30 June 1992. Both members are heavily involved in current references. Mr Sherman has only recently been appointed as Chairman and Mr Gray QC, although he has been a member for almost twelve months, has necessarily been confined to a limited aspect of the Authority's operations. The further complication is that, as a result of Mr Justice Phillips' unexpected resignation, the Authority (in the absence of Messrs Cusack QC and Leckie) would lack members with any significant tenure and experience.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is Government policy, reflected in the National Crime Authority Act 1984, that no member of the Authority should serve for a period longer than four years. That policy is currently enshrined in section 37 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984, and this Bill makes no change to that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, as the Act presently stands, it is not possible to re-appoint members of the Authority, except for members specially appointed in relation to particular references, even if the initial term was for a period less than four years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that one class of member can be re-appointed while others cannot is an anomaly which the Bill will correct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In spite of best planning, the current circumstances facing the Authority show that it is not possible to give a guarantee that continuity and overlap of membership can be provided for administratively. The Bill provides the Government with additional legislative flexibility to assist it in ensuring continuity and loss of expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill has been brought on as a matter of urgency, as the Government wishes to re-appoint both Mr Cusack QC and Mr Leckie for additional periods as members of the National Crime Authority, and that will have to be done before 30 June. The initial appointments of both members was for a period of three years, and the additional appointments will be such as to ensure that the total period of appointment is no more than four years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial impact</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposals put forward in this Bill will have no impact on Government expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TERRITORIES LAW REFORM BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this Bill represents a substantial portion of the legislative action flowing from the Government's response to the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the Sun&mdash;The Legal Regimes of Australia's External Territories and the Jervis Bay Territory</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For Australia's Indian Ocean Territories of Christmas and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, this Bill represents a giant step forward in the task the Government began in 1984 of bringing standards and living conditions in these Territories into line with those of comparable communities elsewhere in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the inadequacy of the existing legal regimes in the Indian Ocean Territories derives from the fact that when the Territories became Australian Territories in the 1950s, their Imperial and Singapore-derived laws were largely left in force. To this base were added local Ordinances and a small number of Commonwealth Acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is widely recognised that the resulting legal regimes are seriously deficient, unfair and inappropriate. These bodies of law have been severely criticised by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the Federal Court, the Territories' Supreme Courts, Human Rights Australia, the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The regimes as they stand also obstruct the Government's objectives of extending to Territories' residents the same rights and opportunities as other Australians enjoy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, in 1984 the Government invited the United Nations to supervise an Act of Self-Determination in Cocos. The Cocos Islanders were given three choices&mdash;independence, integration with an existing country, or free association with an existing country. They voted overwhelmingly for integration with Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The United Nations definition of integration requires that the people of Cocos receive the same treatment and have the same obligations, rights and benefits as mainland Australians. In the lead-up to the Act of Self-Determination, the Commonwealth promised that living standards would be brought to mainland standards not later than 1994. The Government is well on track to meet that timetable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Grants Commission has been used as the arbiter over the changes required. In August 1990 the Government generally accepted the Commission's recommendations to bring government programs, works, services and taxes into line with those on mainland Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed changes were discussed in detail in extensive consultations with the Cocos Malay community leaders. They were incorporated in a Memorandum of Understanding, which was formally signed by the then Prime Minister and Cocos community leaders in March 1991. The M.O.U. provides for upgrading of Government works and services, restructuring of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Council and the Cocos Islands Co-operative, financial assistance to the Council, major law reform, extension of taxation and introduction of mainland employment conditions. These changes are being introduced over three years to be completed on 1 July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the application of a contemporary body of mainland law is fundamental to the changes which are being put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1984 the Government also began the process of bringing conditions on Christmas Island into line with those in mainland Australia. Since then, a form of local government has been extended to the Island and mainland wages and employment conditions have been aligned progressively with mainland standards. Mainland social security benefits and health care arrangements now extend to the Island.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As with Cocos, a Package of Changes has been developed in consultation with the local community to extend to residents of Christmas Island rights, opportunities and obligations equivalent to comparable mainland communities, including similar local and State-type government structures, assistance programs, taxes and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Again, Mr President, the application of a living body of mainland law is fundamental to the changes to be put in place. Not only will it give Island residents the rights and protections under the law enjoyed by their mainland counterparts but it will provide the legal infrastructure necessary for development and economic growth in the Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process of bringing standards and conditions in the Territories into line with those on the mainland has been developed and implemented in close consultation with the Islands communities. A great deal of effort has been devoted to informing the communities about the new legal arrangements and encouraging public debate with the aim of ensuring that the special circumstances of the Islands are accommodated by modifying laws where necessary. Western Australian government departments and agencies are helping with education programs. Information about the new legal regime is being disseminated through newsletters, radio and television broadcasts, visits by experts and public meetings. Independent legal advisers are also being attached to each of the communities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be understood that while this Bill will replace the essentially Singapore based regime with a Western Australian based body of law, this regime will still be subject to modification by Ordinance under the Christmas Island Act and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act. A number of Ordinances are to come into force in conjunction with commencement of this Bill. The most important will deal with interpretation of Western Australian laws in their application to the Territories, and modification of those laws to suit the particular circumstances of the Territories. A further Ordinance will be introduced for Cocos to abolish the Trust under which land is currently held by the Cocos Council, which will enable mainland-style land dealings to take place. The abolition of the Trust in favour of freehold title has the strong support of the Cocos Community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additional Ordinances may be required in the future as the consultation process continues and modifications are required to overcome unforeseen problems or situations peculiar to the Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill applies Western Australian law, as in force from time to time, as Commonwealth law. That is to say, the laws will be in force by virtue of Acts made by this Parliament, rather than by force of the Western Australian Parliament. As such the political responsibility for the applied law will continue to rest with the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The communities in the Territories will be able to influence these Commonwealth processes through their Members of Parliament. They will also be able to make representations direct to the Commonwealth Minister responsible for the Territories. In addition, mechanisms are being developed to facilitate the Islands communities' awareness of the passage of legislation through the Western Australian Parliament and access to more detailed explanation of the effects of legislation on the Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non-judicial powers and duties under the applied Western Australian laws will be vested in the Commonwealth Minister administering the Christmas Island Act and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act. The Minister will be able to direct that particular powers be vested in other persons or authorities, provided they fall within a range of classes specified in this Bill. The Minister will also be able to delegate powers to such persons or authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Judicial powers and duties will initially be vested in the existing courts of the Territories. (The Family Court of Western Australia will exercise jurisdiction under the Family Law Act 1975 from 1 July 1992, as a result of extension of that Act to the Territories; it will be the only Western Australian court having jurisdiction in respect of the Territories at that date.) The Government's preferred position, for a series of reasons including consistency, is for all Western Australian courts to have jurisdiction. It is anticipated that the courts of Western Australia will have the jurisdiction of the Territories conferred on them in the near future&mdash;that is, when formal agreement with Western Australia has been reached. This Bill sets out provisions, to commence on a date to be proclaimed, to allow the jurisdiction to be transferred to Western Australian courts. This conferral of jurisdiction will allow the abolition of the courts of the Territories other than the Supreme Courts. The Supreme Courts will continue to exist, though with truncated jurisdiction, until there is no longer any serving judge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, there are some 700 Acts of Western Australia. It is expected that some 350 Western Australian laws can be applied in full from 1 July 1992 without adverse impact. Approximately another 140 laws will have noticeable impacts but the on-Islands changes required can be readily accommodated from 1 July 1992. These two categories include the bulk of criminal law which was the source of much concern in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the Sun</EMPHASIS> report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A small number of Western Australian Acts will be repealed in their application to the Territories, where they are completely inappropriate or contrary to Commonwealth policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further body of Western Australian Acts will have their operation suspended by Ordinance. The Bill specifically provides for suspension of applied laws by Ordinance, to enable further assessment and consultation, with either or both the Island communities and the Western Australian authorities, on any modification required. This course of action accords with the thrust of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the Sun</EMPHASIS> report that consultation should occur to ensure the particular circumstances of the Indian Ocean Territories and their residents are not adversely affected by the extension of the laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is expected that some 120 laws may fall into this category. The intention is that they be suspended in their application until 1 January 1993 to allow individuals and organisations time to consider them in more detail and to prepare themselves for the impact of these laws. However, it will be possible to further suspend these Acts at 1 January 1993, or to repeal or modify them in their application in the Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining Acts will be modified in their application to the Territories by Territories Ordinances. Some are changed permanently in their effect so as to better suit the Territories. Amendment of others is temporary to allow the residents and businesses of the Territories a reasonable opportunity to make adjustments necessary to comply with new requirements under some laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The choice of Western Australian law, rather than some other body of State type law, was made as it is clearly the most appropriate to be applied to the Territories. The proximity of Western Australia to the Territories and the existing linkages were key considerations. Shipping and air services originate in Perth. Western Australia is the main source of the Islands food, medical and other supplies. But most importantly Western Australia is now the home of many former Cocos and Christmas Islanders. More people of Cocos and Christmas Island origin have chosen to live in Western Australia than remain on the Islands.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Federal law is also being generally extended to the Indian Ocean Territories by this Bill by reversing the current rule that a Federal Act only extends if it is expressed to extend. From 1 July this year a Federal Act will extend unless it is expressed to not extend.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will also amend the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 so that `Australia' and `the Commonwealth', when used in the geographic sense, will include the Christmas and Cocos Islands, unless the contrary intention is specified. As part of making this change, this Bill amends a number of Federal Acts, to ensure they extend, or prevent their extension at this time. After 1 July only a small number of Federal Acts will not extend to the Islands.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from the matters relating to the Indian Ocean Territories, another significant recommendation of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the Sun</EMPHASIS> report was that Australian citizens resident on Norfolk Island be given the right of optional enrolment for the purposes of representation in the Federal Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to be able to inform the Senate that agreement has been reached with the Norfolk Island Government on implementation of this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, however, it has not been possible within the time available to include the necessary amendments to give effect to the agreement in this Bill. However, I understand that the appropriate legislative amendments are being prepared by the Minister for the Arts and Territories for introduction into the Parliament in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will, in Part 4, regularise payments of additional salary received by certain executive members of the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly during 1989. The full Federal Court has held that as a result of a technical deficiency in the relevant Remuneration Tribunal Determination, the executive members concerned were paid additional salary over a period of approximately six months which was not authorised. There is no suggestion of personal dishonesty or impropriety by the members involved. They merely accepted the additional remuneration in accordance with what they understood to be their legal entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with the policy of the gradual transfer of further powers to the Norfolk Island Government, schedule 5 to the Bill seeks to remove the requirement that the remuneration and allowances of members of the Legislative Assembly be determined by the Commonwealth Remuneration Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Norfolk Island Government has established its own Public Sector Remuneration Tribunal which, subject to these amendments, will assume the role of fixing the remuneration of MLAs, executive members and other Assembly office-holders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Norfolk Island Government operates its own fiscus and these proposed amendments will have no effect on Commonwealth revenues or expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The direct cost of changing the legal regimes of Christmas and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands is negligible. However, indirect costs, especially over the first five years are substantial. These indirect costs are associated with the Government's commitment to bring the conditions on the Islands up to a standard comparable with the rest of mainland Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The costings have two components&mdash;recurrent costs and capital works. Under the new legal regime, while total net recurrent costs will increase over the next two years, they will then reduce to below the 1991-92 level. In fact, net recurrent costs (1991-92 values) should reduce from $18.707m in 1991-92 to $14.825m per annum by 1996-97, and should remain at about that level in subsequent years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A substantial capital works program is required on the Islands to bring infrastructure up to mainland standards. Approval has been given for the allocation of $37m for the most urgent of these works on Christmas Island from 1992-93 to 1996-97. Those works and the remainder of a Christmas Island Rebuilding Program worth $132.85m over 10 years are currently being examined by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proposals for capital works for the Cocos (Keeling) Islands are currently being prepared.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG AGENCY AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, it is with a great deal of pleasure that I introduce the Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PURPOSE OF THE BILL</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is for an Act to amend the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990. These amendments have become necessary due to recent developments overseas and in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BACKGROUND</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable senators are no doubt familiar with the recent publicity concerning an Australian cyclist who tested positive for anabolic steroids and subsequently was able to avoid sanctions on a legal technicality. This has made the Government determined to ensure that athletes who cheat on their fellow competitors, their sport and themselves are not able to escape the sanctions they justly deserve. The amendments to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act proposed in this Bill will do just that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also makes provision for a co-ordinated and national approach to the elimination of drug abuse in sport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable senators may not know that over the past eighteen months there have been extensive discussions on the subject of complementary State and Territory anti-doping legislation. At the meeting of all State and Territory sports Ministers last year, Mrs Kelly was able to achieve unanimous agreement that such complementary legislation is desirable, and each State and Territory sports Minister gave a commitment to introduce such legislation. This Bill enables the Commonwealth to honour its undertaking to provide for that complementary legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, Australia is at the leading edge of international developments in the fight against drugs in sport. Before this year, it had executed international antidoping arrangements with Canada and the United Kingdom. This year New Zealand and Norway have joined Australia. A strategy to expand the list of participating countries is being developed. One of the Australian Sports Drug Agency's functions is to ensure Australia's compliance with these arrangements. This Bill will ensure that the agency has the necessary authority to perform this function.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MAJOR FEATURES OF THE BILL</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to spend a little time advising honourable senators of the details of the proposed amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have indicated this Bill makes provision for the Australian States and Territories to confer broader powers on the Australian Sports Drug Agency through complementary antidoping legislation currently proposed by all States and Territories. It will also allow the Agency to work more closely with the States and Territories to ensure a consistent and comprehensive approach towards the elimination of prohibited drugs and doping methods in sport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Sports Drug Agency will now test, both in Australia and overseas, a wider range of athletes for the presence of prohibited drugs. This will include foreign athletes when the test is sought by an overseas anti-doping authority, or when the test is conducted under a contractual arrangement which the Australian Sports Drug Agency may now enter into.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency must be able to recognise procedures adopted by foreign anti-doping authorities which conduct tests on its behalf so it can act on the result of those tests. These amendments will enable the procedures followed by such an authority to be recognised for the purposes of the Act, even if these procedures do not precisely mirror those set out in the Australian Sports Drug Agency regulations. The minimum standard to be adopted and recognised in such cases will now be that provided for in the International Olympic Charter against doping in sport. This does not mean that there is anything wrong with the current regulations; it is merely an amendment which acknowledges that the Australian procedures are stricter and more precise than the internationally accepted standard of the Olympic Charter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Bill also provides athletes with the opportunity to make a submission to the Agency challenging the validity of a positive test result, if the athlete considers that procedures in the following specified areas were not complied with:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">sealing of the container holding the sample;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">testing of the sample by an accredited laboratory; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">evidence of tampering with the sample.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Agency decides the test was valid, the competitor will be entitled to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) to have the decision reviewed. If the AAT reverses the Agency's decision, the competitor's name must be removed from the register.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even if the athlete does not make a submission, the Agency will be required to verify that all procedures relating to these specific matters were followed before validating a positive test result. It will no longer be required to check procedures where noncompliance would not cast doubt on the test result.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments provide for written notification to approved sporting and anti-doping organisations of a positive test result or a refusal to provide a sample. Where this is not possible, alternative arrangements have been provided so that athletes cannot hinder the process by purposely avoiding the notice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many international sporting federations require advice of a possible positive test result to satisfy their own doping policy. This Bill will enable the Agency to satisfy such requests in certain specified circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The name of the register will be changed to `Register of Notifiable Events'. This will reduce the misconception that the entry of a person's name on the register implies some finding of `guilt'. The notion of guilt was never intended to be associated with the entry of names on the register. The question of guilt and application of sanctions is and has always been a matter for sporting organisations, not the agency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this Bill recognises the need to give minors special consideration, by providing for the removal of a name from the register once the period of any sanction imposed by sporting organisations has elapsed, if at the time of the request to provide a sample the person was under 18 years of age.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Sports Drug Agency is increasingly being recognised overseas and domestically as having the professional expertise to arrange for the collection and testing of samples to detect the presence of prohibited drugs, and therefore will be called on more and more to arrange such tests overseas and in Australia, at the request of both overseas and Australian authorities and sporting organisations. This Bill includes amendments which will give it the power to enter into contracts or arrangements with overseas governments and other sporting authorities and antidoping authorities to arrange for the collection and testing of samples.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the current international anti-doping arrangements with Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Norway each country has agreed that in another country, their athletes will be subject to the domestic testing regime of the host country. As a result, there will be occasions when, even though the agency has made no request for a test, it will receive information on the results of tests on Australian athletes conducted by overseas anti-doping authorities. It may also receive similar information from other foreign anti-doping bodies. The Bill includes amendments which enable the Agency to pass this information to the same persons or organisations that it would pass similar information to if it had conducted the test. These include the athlete, the sporting organisations of which the athlete is a member and, if Commonwealth funding through the Australian Sports Commission is involved, the Commission. However, it may only pass this information on if it is satisfied that, at the time the sample was requested, the anti-doping body was following procedures which were in accord with the Olympic Charter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many anti-doping bodies throughout the world. For example, as international sporting federations arrange for the collection and testing of samples for the purpose of detecting prohibited substances, each could be regarded as an anti-doping body. As more and more countries adopt similar anti-doping regimes to Australia, the number of anti-doping bodies will increase dramatically. Some may not be as meticulous and thorough as the Australian Sports Drug Agency. To ensure the interests of Australian athletes are protected, the Agency will have to screen these anti-doping bodies to ensure that their procedures accord with the international accepted standard, that is, the Olympic Charter. The amendments allow the Australian Sports Drug Agency to approve foreign anti-doping bodies which adopt at least standards provided for in the Olympic Charter and will be required to maintain a list of such bodies. The Agency will also be given the power to request such an approved body to take a sample from a competitor who is an Australian citizen or permanent resident when that competitor is overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FINANCIAL IMPACT STATEMENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be no additional financial obligations imposed on the Commonwealth by this Bill. Any additional costs arising from the Agency entering into contracts or arrangements with overseas sporting organisations or anti-doping bodies will be fully recovered, while the cost of additional tests, resulting from complementary legislation passed by States and Territories, will be borne by the States and Territories.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The receipt of the resolution of 14 May from the Western Australian Legislative Assembly squarely points to the dismal record of this Labor Government, and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in particular, in a desperate campaign of bluster and prevarication seeking to deny vital information to the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government in Western Australia. The significance of these actions is not diminished by the enforced retreat of Mr Keating on 15 May, by the statement of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) that amendments to the Taxation Administration Act have `accommodated the WA Royal Commission's particular reporting requirements' or the fact that the principal solicitor of the Royal Commission has stated that the commissioners believed that the proposed amendments would satisfy their requirements. One only has to look at exactly what they have had to go through to get these particular amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this resolution from the Legislative Assembly calls for, no more and no less, is a repeat of the action taken in December 1987 when the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill amended both the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Taxation Administration Act to enable, as it was stated by the then Attorney-General, the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct to have access to taxation information on the same basis as applies to taxation information disclosed to the Commonwealth royal commissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment then also gave the Commissioner authority to disclose the information to State as well as Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. The purpose of these amendments was very simple and very direct. Mr Bowen stated on 8 December 1987 that there was `genuine public interest' in the provision of Commonwealth assistance to the Fitzgerald Commission. But we can only ask why, until now, this public interest has not been applied in regard to Western Australia in the mind of the same government. Could the overriding consideration be that, on this occasion, mates are involved?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact remains that until 14 May, the Western Australian Labor Government and the Keating Labor Government were stating falsely that the Royal Commission could have obtained access to tax records under provision for such information to be disclosed to senior law enforcement officers under section 3E of the Taxation Administration Act 1989. It is a fact that this Labor Government sought to enforce one rule for a royal commission that was investigating the misdeeds of its political opponents and another for an inquiry seeking to uncover the incompetence and corruption that occurred under Labor governments in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact that the resolution of the Legislative Assembly in Western Australia does more than simply ask the Federal Parliament to facilitate necessary access to Australian Taxation Office records by the Royal Commission. Quite properly the Assembly insists that the Royal Commission be given the same right as was the Fitzgerald Royal Commission through the 1987 Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill. That eventually has been the Labor Government's position in Western Australia, asking the Labor Federal Government to actually do something. But it has taken its time. It has taken the State Labor Government all its time to ask for this and it has taken the Federal Labor Government all its time to deliver. But this is the principle that is at stake&mdash;the right of the people and the Parliament of Western Australia to be sure that there is no diminution whatsoever of the rights of access given to another inquiry in a State in 1987. This is a clear signal that the legislation promised by this Government must not in any way be more limited than that carried in 1987 when of course Mr Keating was Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation was supported by the Opposition and during debate it was noted that the same cooperation should be extended to future similar inquiries involving State Government actions. We in the Liberal and National parties supported the Government's action in providing the information to the Fitzgerald Royal Commission in Queensland, and yet here we have a situation where this Government simply closed the door, put on the blinkers and tried to blame the Public Service for the lack of access to the information for Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was as Treasurer that on 21 May 1991 Mr Keating replied to the request of the Western Australian Royal Commission for access to tax records:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . for reasons of good tax administration the Government is strongly of the view that the current level of secrecy of income tax information should not be disturbed.</PARA>
<PARA>Good tax administration indeed! He insultingly stated that a request could be made when related to a specific offence when in fact the information had been sought because of the difficulty encountered by the Commission in determining illegal conduct in relation to the Rothwells saga and money trails were disappearing overseas. We are not talking about $50 or $100 in these money trails going overseas; we are talking about $500m that has disappeared from Rothwells, and this Labor Government prevaricated on whether or not it would give access to Australian Taxation Office records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a fact that has been glossed over by Mr Keating that such requests should refer to the availability of tax records after a commission has completed its inquiry and subsequent criminal investigations are being made. Is that not handy? He says that we can have it after the event but not before. The fact is that in section 3E of the Taxation Administration Act 1989 allows only an officer of a law enforcement agency to divulge or communicate taxation information for the purpose of investigation of a serious offence. The Prime Minister and his Government well understand that a royal commission's inquiries go to a far wider sense than this and that that is the royal commission's right and proper role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How convenient also for a Government determined to protect its mates to hide behind the advice of public servants who, quite predictably and quite correctly, wish to preserve secrecy. Who was Mr Keating trying to bluff, con or cajole when he stated that people were more likely to disclose information voluntarily when they were satisfied that the use of the information would be limited? That is hardly an attitude that anyone would expect from people desperately seeking to avoid investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And let us not forget the selective amnesia that Messrs Brian and Terry Burke have had, along with Mr Peter Dowding and Mr David Parker; all either former Premiers or senior Ministers. Who would be silly enough to believe that they would suddenly tell all? They have no recollection of most of the events that have happened about which they have been questioned in the Royal Commission, yet the Prime Minister tries to say that they would be quite happy to voluntarily disclose the information that is required. Clearly, it was the duty of a responsible Federal government to make the decision to ensure that highly comparable inquiries receive the same degree of cooperation from the Australian Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who can be fooled by the subsequent letter of the Hon. Ralph Willis as Acting Treasurer, responding to a further request from the Commission of 29 August last year&mdash;which I might add was never answered by Treasurer Kerin&mdash;that the granting of access to the Fitzgerald Commission should not be seen as a precedent for all State royal commissions? Nothing better illustrates the determination of the Government as a whole in blocking necessary access to information to protect its mates. That is the clarity of the whole matter that we are dealing with. Indeed, it is just as true to state that a new precedent was created by the refusal of this Labor Government to follow the example taken with the Fitzgerald Commission and other Commonwealth royal commissions where access to income tax records has been granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under section 16 of the Taxation Assessment Act, the Commissioner of Taxation has authority to pass on information to a royal commission acting in respect of letters patent issued by the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolution tabled today from the Western Australian Legislative Assembly seeks the same rights for the Western Australian Royal Commission. It is not asking for anything more; it is simply asking for the same treatment. That can never be considered unreasonable. In turn, the Royal Commission, under section 16(4A) has the right to communicate the information to a special prosecutor. It must be emphasised that this request from the Royal Commission has not arisen through some peripheral question. Investigation into the collapse of Rothwells was one of the most significant tasks of the inquiry, as it is well understood that it is a central matter of WA Inc that directly involved two former Premiers and leading Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stalling by Mr Keating and successive Labor Treasurers last year is every bit as serious as the outburst of the Prime Minister on 14 May, as the time available for the Commission to complete its investigations is now severely limited. I suppose if one can hold off for long enough and hope that no-one twigs to it, then one gets away with it. But, unfortunately, on this occasion the Government has not got away with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was an insult not only to the Royal Commission but also to the Western Australian Parliament and to the people of Western Australia when Mr Keating poured scorn on the Commission for engaging in a fishing expedition. In some respects, a lot of people in the Labor Government, when it so suits them, would say that that is the real role of a royal commission. It suited them with the Fitzgerald Royal Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct to have a fishing expedition but, of course, on this occasion when it comes to the Western Australian investigation into WA Inc. it does not suit them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister made a personal attack on leading counsel assisting the Commission in describing his submission as `offensive and self-serving'. He advanced the spurious excuse that 1989 legislative changes would have allowed police attached to the Commission to seek information from the Tax Commissioner. What rot! He does not understand&mdash;and of course the Premier obviously does not understand&mdash;that today that is what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Police attached to the Commission did not of course include the Commissioner and did not, therefore, have the seniority to request or indeed pass on any such information. Once the four police officers work with the Royal Commission, they become Royal Commission investigators and have no entitlement to seek taxation records under the Tax Administration Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ignoring this fact, Mr Keating sought to erode the public standing of the Commission by alleging that these officers were feuding with Commission staff, which they were not, and accused the Commission of provoking political controversy for having the temerity to finally make public a major impediment to its investigations nearly 12 months after their initial request had been denied. Here we have a government talking about provoking political controversy. If that is not what this Government is doing about this issue, then I ask what is it doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, there was not much respect shown to the Western Australian Parliament when Mr Keating stated that the request of the Premier, Dr Lawrence, for the information was `not worth taking seriously'. The Prime Minister just dismissed out of hand the requests by Dr Lawrence, the Labor Premier of Western Australia. Of course, he also absolutely ignored the Labor member Ron Edwards who himself has admitted that he knew more than he told at the time. He has admitted that to the Royal Commission. Why did he not come clean up-front about what he knew about a lot of the funds?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Mr Keating may have bowed to the public pressure the next day, I certainly do not recall any statement of apology for the aspersions cast on the competence and integrity of the Royal Commission. He just cast those aspersions against that Royal Commission, which has been doing a fine job under extremely difficult circumstances&mdash;little did we know how difficult until a couple of weeks ago&mdash;and he has not had the decency to even apologise. I am certain that that is not just a further case of bad manners but a deliberate hope that some doubt would remain in the public mind as to the authority of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell the Senate that there is no doubt about the authority of the Commission by people in Western Australia. They hold the Commission in the highest regard. They know what they have unearthed. They know what they are dealing with. They know where the money has gone. They know the people who have been involved in corruption. They will decide for themselves. In short, Mr Keating was not simply engaged in an exercise of denying information to the Royal Commission but also in politicising it and undermining its credibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The State Labor Government cannot escape its share of blame when on 13 May the Premier had defended Mr Keating in State Parliament by repeating the Keating line that the Royal Commission could obtain direct access to files through the police. Why did she not check that that was possible before standing up in the Western Australian Parliament and just repeating Mr Keating's lines for the sake of it? If she had bothered to check, she would have found out that those police officers would have faced imprisonment had they done what she and Mr Keating suggested. But that was not significant enough for her either. She suddenly obviously realised the error of her ways the next day but did not bother apologising, did not bother explaining; she just decided that maybe she had better join the public request of making sure that the Federal Labor Government made this information available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are entitled to ask whether Dr Lawrence and Mr Keating knew of the difficulties encountered by the Commission over the previous 12 months and what actions they took in seeking access to tax records. What a difference a day makes, though. Recognising that a government that cannot rely on Assembly numbers must bow to the inevitable, the resolution before the Senate today went forward one day later, on 14 May. It was purely and simply based on the number of Independents now in the Western Australian Parliament. They could not rely on them sticking by them, and they certainly could not rely on the people of Western Australia sticking by them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Premier also stated on 14 May the obvious fact that the interests of the Royal Commission transcend those of the privacy of the tax records. She, of course, has said nothing about the part that the public outrage played in the reversal of her opinion. Quite clearly, that was a pressure that was put on her that she could not ignore. We may question, of course, the commitment of Mr Keating to the cause of privacy when a senior Minister in his Government, the current Minister for Social Security, Dr Blewett, once belittled privacy as a bourgeois right when he was seeking to impose the horrendous Australia Card. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a few occasions in the past I have taken the opportunity of the adjournment debate to present to the Senate an account of the use or misuse of chemicals in Australia. Tonight I add to that portfolio with the documentation of an incident of spraying insecticides which has had a devastating effect on a school in Hobart.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The D'Alton Special School in New Town has 64 students from kindergarten to grade 7, all with a variety of physical disabilities. On Sunday, 4 August 1991, the inside of the school was routinely sprayed for Argentine ants. Two commercial brands of spray were used, Cislin 10, containing deltamethrin, formaldehyde and propylene glycol, and Insectagas D, containing dichlorvus and liquid carbon dioxide. The school had previously been sprayed on two occasions earlier in the school year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the following Monday school began as normal, and at 10.30 a.m. a phone call from the Douglas Parker Rehabilitation Centre, to which the school is annexed, asked that the children not be allowed contact with the floor. At about 11 a.m., after children had been picked up from the floor&mdash;remember that most of these children suffer from a variety of physical disabilities&mdash;the first toxic reactions began, with some people's throats closing up, severe headaches being suffered and eyes also being affected. Over the next few days these symptoms became progressively worse, until almost all of the staff were affected, some to the point of requiring time off from school duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 9 August, Neocid 200, containing diazanon in a coarse spray, was sprayed around the outside of the school building, including alongside the walls, with the school windows open. From that point in time the severity and frequency of the reactions began to increase and a few people became quite frighteningly ill. So many people at the school were affected severely that officialdom finally decided to conduct an investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Director of Public Health announced to the victims and the media, which had become interested at this stage, that everybody at the school was suffering from some form of the winter virus that was prevalent at the time and that the coincidence of the insecticide spraying had simply produced an emotive reaction. When the problem continued, the school was eventually evacuated, not because of a problem with the environment but to allay peoples' concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, what made this virus particularly interesting were the unusual variety of features displayed in the one strain as those features were collated by the Director when interviewing personnel. These features included the symptoms of headache, irritability, disorientation, oedema, incontinence, severe depression, teary, sore eyes and blurred vision, dermatitis, muscular weakness, inflamed larynx, lost voices and premature menstrual haemorrhaging in five of the women staff. Also fascinating was the fact that this so-called virus confined itself to the D'Alton site and D'Alton people. It did not transmit itself to families or associates. The little beast would go away in milder cases shortly after the people left the building, only to ambush them again when they returned to the site, with a renewal of the same symptoms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of the Department's investigation, staff were told that there were no tests available in Tasmania to assess the possibility of exposure to insecticides. It was small consolation to the victims when Health Department representatives apologised profusely for this misinformation long after tests would have been of value. Even more disgusting was the fact that in the initial investigation nobody bothered to interview the pupils at this school and the volunteers who were working there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the event, victims were told that advice from the National Health and Medical Research Council was that testing was inappropriate in the absence of individual baseline levels. In fact, they commented that such testing is not only inappropriate but unethical. At this point I would like to say that I am particularly concerned about these comments from the NHMRC. In the absence of any collections of real data about the on-ground real life effects of chemicals, I would have thought that such tests might have proved useful in the long term. If they were requested by the people involved, how on earth could they have been unethical?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health authorities now gave the school a clean bill of health. The staff went back and there was a fresh outbreak of the symptoms already described. During the school holidays the school was thoroughly cleaned and the air-conditioning vents wiped, although no air analysis or testing of the system was carried out. The person who did the cleaning got sick. Again staff and students returned to the school and again the symptoms reappeared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An inquiry was called for. Visiting VIPs, and even those doing the testing, were affected but still had no clue what to test for. The odds-on favourite was still a virus, but new theories began to emerge like flies on a summer's day. First there was pollen from the wattles&mdash;remember that we have reached springtime now&mdash;and then mould along the skirting boards was introduced as a theory. Perhaps it was even the urine-soaked carpet tiles combining with chlorine fumes from the swimming pool some distance away at the Douglas Parker Centre. All these theories have been disproved and discounted. The air-conditioning was eventually extensively tested on 19 September 1991, after everything had been cleaned. The subsequent report suggested sick building syndrome as a possible cause of the illnesses suffered by staff and students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the D'Alton Special School remains closed today. Students who attended</PARA>
<PARA>the school are now bussed to other schools. The problem with the building remains unsolved but active. The toys that have been removed from the building since its closure have caused skin irritations and blisters when handled, and photographs collected by a staff member have caused headaches, rashes and sore eyes. Staff members who were severely affected right back at the beginning of this saga have had recurrent health problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst acknowledging that something is definitely wrong at the D'Alton school, authorities are still refusing to consider the possibility of insecticide poisoning. When public health is affected so severely and so suddenly, surely there is a responsibility to investigate all possible causes of the symptoms without any fear or hesitation. What I have described to the Senate tonight is just another example of the strange attitude we have in this country of `don't want to know' or `too hard to handle'&mdash;an attitude that seems to be particularly prevalent when it comes to the use of chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will continue to bring to the Senate examples that can be documented, examples that have dates, times and places attached, examples that should concern those of us who are making decisions about what it is appropriate to do with regard to chemical use in this country. </PARA>

The Associate Diploma is a three year part-time course which commenced in 1991. It has a maximum of 30 students per annual intake.

The training needed for immediate and anticipated duties is identified and agreed upon. The supervisor's specific approval is required before any training is undertaken and work performance and revised training needs are jointly reviewed at six monthly intervals. Staff of the Personnel Development Section regularly conduct follow-up evaluation interviews with a randomly selected sample of participants between two and four weeks after the completion of each course. In addition, written evaluation reports are sought from the participants of the majority of formal training courses. In the case of language training, once training has commenced fortnightly report forms are submitted by tutors and proficiency target levels are set to ensure programs are achieved. Regular language proficiency exams are required of officers and the results are maintained on a central data base and monitored for departmental use.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. The distinction between private and commercial operations is set out in the Civil Aviation Regulations (CARs) and CAR 2(7A) (attached) adequately defines the parameters for private cost sharing flights.  The intent of the legislation is clearly set out and allows persons undertaking a private flight, including the operating crew, to share equally in the costs of the flight.  By the very nature of the operation, the people who engage in private cost sharing flights should be either friends or acquaintances of the pilot.</PARA>
