<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Coulter) moving a motion relating to the order of business on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable senators to bear in mind that this allows half an hour for debate on this matter, with five minutes per speaker. The Democrats are convinced that there should be no further reductions in tariffs whatsoever while this country suffers from its very high rate of unemployment&mdash;a rate of unemployment which is increasing; a rate of unemployment which, if one looks at figures in recent days, indicates that the numbers of long term unemployed, those people who are absolutely desperate, is increasing at a remarkably rapid rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one were to accept for the moment the argument put by both the Government and the Opposition that tariff reduction will improve the economy in the longer term, then there may be some validity in tariff reduction, provided that there are other jobs available for those people who are displaced by the reduction in tariffs and the closure of the large number of businesses that are collapsing all around the country since this tariff reduction has been in place. But opportunities for alternative employment are not there. It is totally unconscionable that both the Government and the Opposition should continue to proceed with tariff reductions at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of debate recently as to whether there are differences between the Government and the Opposition in relation to tariff reductions. The Government, particularly in the person of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), has been desperately attempting to show that there are differences between the Government and the Opposition in this area. But I note that most of the commentators who have looked very carefully at the statements made by both sides have observed that there is no difference at all in policy, that Mr Keating is merely attempting to create an impression that there is a difference. Dr Hewson is well aware of this. </PARA>
<PARA>I quote from a statement which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on Friday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Hewson said on ABC radio last night he did not believe the Coalition's tariff proposal was handicapping it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>specifically in Wills&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">because it was `in the context of a very substantial program of reform over the rest of the decade'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'd make two points. One is there really isn't all that much difference between our two policies&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the policy of the Government and the policy of the Opposition. We want to put it fairly and squarely on the record that, at this time with a million people unemployed, with a growing number of unemployed, with a very high unemployment rate among the young, and with people who are becoming permanently unemployable as a consequence of the tariff reduction policies and the consequent closure of businesses, it is absolutely unconscionable to blindly pursue this economic rationalist reduction in tariffs which exacerbates the situation. It may be reasonable to do it at a time when there is high and growing employment, but not at this time. We call on both the Government and the Opposition to reverse their positon on tariff reductions. We call on the Government to halt tariff reductions until there is a substantial turnaround in employment opportunities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have a small economy and a small population. There are enormous markets and enormous opportunities out there for us. But we cannot have it both ways. Australia is debating in GATT at the present time and has been debating in the Uruguay Round since 1986 for a reduction in international barriers, not only in respect of agriculture, which is of particular importance to us, but also in other areas such as the service industry, intellectual property and investment-related opportunities. There is a need to give the Australian economy the chance to expand internationally and so enable growth and jobs to be created. We cannot have it both ways. Australia cannot go to GATT or other international bodies and argue that others should reduce barriers in order for us to have greater opportunity, whilst at the same time arguing that the barriers we have in this country should be retained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, the Australian Democrats seem to be the only political grouping in this country which still cannot see that argument and they are fairly irrelevant these days in any event. Australia needs to internationalise and seize the opportunities in those international markets. We cannot do that by maintaining barriers whilst at the same time arguing that others should reduce them to give us those opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I mentioned agriculture, Senator Coulter pointed to my colleague Senator Boswell. Senator Boswell knows the opportunities that will arise for Australian rice farmers when the markets in Japan and Korea are opened. Under the GATT proposals and the Dunkel compromise, both markets would be open and this will give new opportunities for Australian agricultural producers. The Democrats cannot argue that they should be opened whilst at the same time arguing that Australian protection should be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bipartisan trade committee of this Parliament which was sent to Europe last year found that there is still appalling ignorance within Europe, and within France in particular. There is a belief that the Democrat position reigns supreme, and that there is a general view amongst Australian Government policy-makers that tariffs should be maintained. Europe does not understand that there have already been reductions in industrial areas in Australia. But they said to us, `Unless you are prepared to bring those barriers down, you cannot expect to have the new opportunities that can be created in the international community'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia should be concentrating on increasing domestic efficiency. If we can be domestically efficient in our production, then we can be competitive. That is what the whole coalition policy is all about. It is about getting the cost of business down and cutting the cost of government in particular. It is about getting the taxation burden off businesses. That is why we are advocating cutting $20 billion a year off business taxation. This will enable business to be efficient again, to expand and to employ Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why our policy seeks to reform industrial relations. There is a need for both labour and employers to join together to negotiate employment agreements that can provide maximum opportunity and efficiency. That is why we advocate reform of infrastructure in this country. We need to be internationally competitive. We need to get rid of the cost burdens that are imposed on our producers by the waterfront and transport systems in Australia. If we concentrate on those areas, we will then have an opportunity to be internationally competitive again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if we go back to the dark ages of Democrat policy and argue that the barriers should go up and if in some way we isolate ourselves from the international community and international competition, the result in this country will be an ever-lowering standard of living&mdash;which is the legacy we have inherited from 10 years of Labor&mdash;and a lack of opportunity for business to expand. We already have the tragedy of nearly one million unemployed. What do the Democrats want to do? Do they want to quarantine or lock in the one million unemployed? That is not the answer to Australia's economic future. We must open up, get out there, compete and provide jobs. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The Government will not be supporting the suspension of Standing Orders in relation to this matter, principally because we regard it as a motion based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the way in which investment decisions are taken in this country and, therefore, the way jobs are created in response to those investment decisions. If the Government adopted this proposal and changed the law today, and if there were a view that changing those laws would create more jobs, not one job would be created this year.

That would mean that when they invest today they would not know what the investment climate is going to be in six, 12 or 18 months time. It is exactly the wrong position to take. It would stop anybody investing because there would be that worst of all situations&mdash;uncertainty. It is a guarantee of failure, whereas, the position that the Government set down on 12 March last year&mdash;contrary to some of the breathless responses to more recent comments&mdash;remains in place and no-one is proposing to change what we set down on 12 March last year. </PARA>

If a protection of infant industries argument applied in the 1950s, the infant industries we have in Australia today do not want that protection, and they want the overlay of excessive protection that arose from the 1950s taken away from the industries which are their suppliers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats have called for the suspension of Standing Orders to allow a debate in which we would call for a halt at this point to the tariff cuts program of the Government. We want to bring to close attention the disaster of the tariff cuts regime implemented at this stage by the Government, and supported by the Opposition whose own scorched earth policy is only a matter of degree by way of difference from that of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the contributions thus far on the question of whether this debate should take place on this motion for suspension of Standing Orders, the Democrats' position has been, as usual, grossly misrepresented. It is not the Democrats' intention that we should go backwards on the issue of tariff policy in this country; it is not our intention that we should re-erect around our industries and across the board the brick wall that was erected in the days of `Black Jack' McEwen. Although let it be said that, at its time, much of what happened in the post-Second World War era was appropriate. We acknowledge that what is needed is a targeted policy and one which, at the moment, needs to be changed because of the drastic and tragic levels of unemployment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will remind the Senate of that situation. We have only to look at the very recent past to see the tragic nature of the problem, a problem which really cannot be overstated. Between January 1990 and January 1992, unemployment almost doubled from 550,400 to 960,000&mdash;that is almost one million people. Then, of course, there are the dependants in the families of those people who suffer under the burden of unemployment. We are facing the fact that unemployment will rise above that figure and, indeed, is above that figure in hidden unemployment&mdash;a point which the Opposition continues to pursue&mdash;because many people such as young people, women and even family breadwinners, have given up looking for jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of people who have been out of work for one year or more almost trebled in that same two-year period from 115,900 to 274,200. Unemployment is a massive problem. These days we have changed our definitions. Long term unemployment now means having been unemployed for more than a year, whereas previously it meant having been unemployed for only six months. We are reclassifying the tragedy of unemployment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it clear what the Australian Democrats are proposing: we are proposing that the tariff cuts program of the Government, which has got out of hand and which is ignoring the social cost that it is placing on the community, stops now. We see the by-election in Wills as being a very important demonstration of the damage that has been created. In that electorate the TCF industries are prominent, or at least have been prominent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan, in his contribution, talked about what industry is saying it wants&mdash;it wants to be able to set goals, it wants to be able to plan ahead. In the TCF industries that is exactly what has happened and yet factories continue to close down. Last year 18 factories closed down in the electorate of Wills, 600 jobs were lost and a further 2,000 jobs are at risk. The TCF Council has made its views very clear about what it wants and, indeed, has exhorted people in the electorate of Wills to vote for the Australian Democrats to really send a message to this place about tariff policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are saying that a meeting of TCF employees and unions should be called to identify the specific products and industry sectors which need increased tariff protection in the context of the Government's program; that these should be implemented; that emergency procedures should be initiated to reduce the damage caused by dumping of cheap imports; and that these measures should be extended to other industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are listening, too, to what industry is saying; we are seeing what is happening to the people. The hoax that Prime Minister Keating has tried to perpetrate on the people of Wills&mdash;that there is an essential difference between the Government and the Opposition&mdash;is not working. We are already seeing that in the polls. It is quite clear that the targeted, socially conscious position that the Australian Democrats are taking on tariffs is not going back into the past, it is future orientated and it is people orientated.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill makes various amendments to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">revise provisions concerning conscription and conscientious objection;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">enable the appointment of the Assistant Chief of the Defence Force (Personnel) to the Defence Housing Authority;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">tidy up legislation providing for Defence retirement benefits and home loans assistance schemes; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">repeal obsolete retirement benefits provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this speech I will concentrate on the revision of the conscription and conscientious objection provisions. The other matters are straightforward and are sufficiently covered by the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only legislation currently in force which provides for conscription and conscientious objection is contained in Part IV of the Defence Act, which limits compulsory military service to a time of war. In this context, it is important to note that "time of war" has a defined and limited meaning: a period of actual or apprehended enemy invasion of, or attack on, Australia. I would like to assure the Senate that the current amendments do not alter this fundamental threshold. The Government's view continues to be that conscription could be justified where Australia is directly threatened but not otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments now proposed stem from the Government's decision, announced in the Senate by Senator Evans on 5 December 1986, to accept recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. The essential changes would add recognition of conscientious objection to particular conflicts, as distinct from war in general, and require prior parliamentary approval of conscription.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I doubt that anyone would argue these days against the requirement for prior parliamentary approval of conscription. The desirability of providing for conscientious objection to particular conflicts might not be quite so self evident. However, the Government was persuaded by the view of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs that, in some cases, an individual's sense of personal integrity could be violated by compulsion to participate in a particular military conflict but not in other conflicts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important element of the new provisions is definition of a person's conscientious belief as one that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">involves a fundamental conviction of what is morally right and morally wrong, whether or not based on religious considerations;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">is so compelling in character for that person that he or she is duty bound to espouse it; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">is likely to be of a long standing nature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This definition would give clear guidance to tribunals considering claims of conscientious belief but is sufficiently broad to ensure coverage of any genuine case. Although Australian legislation has recognised conscientious objection to compulsory military service for more than 80 years, the nature of the conscientious belief required has been determined largely by judicial decisions on claims. In this most significant area, the Government believes that the Parliament by legislation should set out the key characteristics of conscientious belief to ensure that there is clear and consistent guidance for future decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another important innovation is provision for establishment of special conscientious objection tribunals. (Of course, such tribunals would only be established in the most unlikely event of conscription to meet a threat to Australia.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The old model, of traditional adversarial proceedings before a magistrate, has been abandoned as inappropriate. New tribunals would be established for the specific purpose of determining claims of conscientious beliefs. They would be composed of a presiding member, who had at least 7 years experience as a legal practitioner, and 2 other members, who were capable of ascertaining facts other than by adversarial procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation specifically requires conscientious objection tribunals to adopt quick, fair, just and economical procedures. They are also required to act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case, and are not bound by technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence. Although the tribunals are clearly expected to operate as informally as possible, they are given sufficient formal powers (such as the capacity to summon witnesses) to exercise their functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conscientious objection tribunals would normally take oral evidence in public but would have a discretion to take evidence in private or to take written evidence. A person claiming exemption from service because of a conscientious belief would bear the onus of proof, on the balance of probabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The right of appeal from conscientious objection tribunals would be to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Further appeal to the Federal Court would be allowed on a question of law or, with the leave of the Court, on any other ground.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the review of the current legislation, the opportunity has been taken to remove discriminatory provisions, e.g. where obligations depend on whether a person is a "male person", a "British subject" or an "Aboriginal native". These amendments are quite clearly well overdue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am particularly pleased that this Bill proposes the repeal of the National Service Act 1951. It is, of course, true that this Act has for all practical purposes been defunct since 1972. The Whitlam Government disbanded the national service scheme in December 1972 and the National Service Termination Act 1973 removed any legal obligation to register for or render national service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Service Act was not repealed at that time because some national servicemen continued voluntarily in the Army. The Act has remained on the statute books, even though defunct. Repeal of the Act will remove this last vestige of an unhappy and divisive episode in our history. Despite the repeal, any entitlements that may have accrued to individuals through rendering national service have been explicitly preserved, where necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This outline has necessarily been condensed. However, I trust that it has indicated the substantial improvements that would be in place if ever there was a requirement to introduce conscription and to hear claims for exemption based on conscientious belief. The Government's aim has been to preserve the capacity to introduce conscription for the protection of Australia, but to ensure that those claiming exemption would receive a rapid and fair hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CORPORATION LEGISLATION (EVIDENCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to remove certain immunities available to witnesses under the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) Law and the Corporations Law. The need for the legislation arises from difficulties encountered by the Australian Securities Commission in investigating complex corporate frauds, to which I shall refer shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the outset, however, it is necessary to understand the background against which the issues addressed in this Bill arise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been an established rule of the common law, since the 17th century, that a person can not be compelled to incriminate himself, and may refuse to answer any question, or produce any document or thing, which may put him at risk of conviction. This rule arose out of the principle, fundamental to our system of justice, that the Crown must prove the guilt of accused persons, rather than allow the executive to require suspects to convict themselves out of their own mouths.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In various circumstances, however, legislatures have recognised that the intended purpose of a statute may only be achieved by either limiting or abrogating this privilege against self-incrimination. The superseded co-operative scheme companies legislation, which preceded the current national scheme legislation, was such a case. Under that scheme the National Companies and Securities Commission could conduct examinations in which the common law privilege against self-incrimination was excluded by legislation. In return, the legislation provided an immunity, known as the "use immunity", which prevented answers which tended to be self-incriminatory from later being used in evidence against a person in criminal proceedings or proceedings for the imposition of a penalty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1983, the then Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, in the decision Sorby v The Commonwealth (1983) 152 CLR 281, criticised a narrow application of such use immunities, stating that evidence obtained through, or derived from, the evidence protected by the use immunity, should also be inadmissible in proceedings against the person&mdash;the so-called "derivative use immunity".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This suggestion was taken up by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, when in its 1984 Report on the National Crime Authority Bill 1983 it advocated that where the privilege against self-incrimination was abolished by Parliament, the prosecution should be unable to use in evidence either the actual incriminating words and documents produced under compulsion, or any evidence discovered as a result of those words and documents. This "use/derivative use immunity" is now applied by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reporting on the Australian Securities Commission Bill, however, the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation stated, at paragraph 4.60, its belief that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">subclause 68(3) [drafted in compliance with the Scrutiny of Bills Committee's policy of "use/derivative use immunity"] will not unnecessarily or unacceptably act to abrogate the privilege against self-incrimination if it were amended to apply only to statements made by a person and not to any information, document or any other thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of the person making the statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Though suggesting that removal of the derivative use immunity would be appropriate, the Committee did not include a recommendation to that effect in its Report. Subsection 68(3) of the ASC Law therefore provides a use/derivative use immunity in respect of information obtained by the ASC in investigations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Securities Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions, the agencies responsible respectively for investigating and prosecuting corporate fraud, have been experiencing serious problems in bringing effective prosecutions as the "use immunity" prevents the admission of evidence of the fact that a particular person produced a particular document, and the "derivative use immunity" protects evidence gained as a result of answers to questions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problems being experienced may be understood from a hypothetical example&mdash;to protect shareholders and creditors of a corporation under investigation, the ASC may consider that its assets should be frozen and its dealings restrained. To do this, evidence may need to be obtained under compulsion from a key person. However, as any incriminating information gained, together with any evidence derived from that information, would attract immunity, that person could not subsequently be prosecuted. To avoid this, the ASC may try to obtain the evidence without questioning major suspects. While it does so, assets may be concealed or dissipated, disadvantaging creditors and shareholders. Thus, pursuit of remedies for the protection of shareholders and creditors may prevent successful criminal prosecutions, while major suspects, whose evidence could uncover other serious offences calling for wider inquiries, tend to be questioned narrowly, if at all, because the derivative use immunity provisions would allow them to escape conviction and punishment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also possible for persons to exploit, quite consciously, the immunity provisions, by claiming that answers may tend to be self-incriminating, then making a full confession, thereby ensuring that no evidence will be admissible against them in criminal proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another problem arising from the application of the provisions is that complex cases involve the admission into evidence of hundreds, even thousands, of documents, all or many of which may be challenged by the defence on the grounds of derivative use immunity. This has the potential to make cases extremely lengthy and costly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, because the fact that a person has produced a document is not admissible against the person, the link between the person's original possession of the document and its introduction into evidence against the person is broken. This may mean that the person escapes conviction because an essential link in the chain of evidence is missing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In developing the new corporations and securities legislation the aim was to balance the conflicting interests of efficient business, shareholders and creditors, civil liberties and effective law enforcement, so as to achieve a workable result.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The law as it stands at present fails to take adequate account of the difficulties faced by the ASC and the DPP, the bodies responsible for effectively investigating and prosecuting corporate crime. The practical position is that the ASC can not use its powers to investigate certain suspected criminal activity. The problems of proof created by the derivative use immunity and the immunity for the fact of a person signing a record or producing a document are affecting its role in corporate law enforcement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue was recently re-examined by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, which in its report tabled on 15 November 1991, recommended the removal of the derivative use immunity from the national scheme, together with the use immunity with regard to the fact that a person has produced a document. It also recommended that corporations be expressly excluded from claiming the privilege against self-incrimination. These recommendations followed the recognition that the availability of full use/derivative use immunity is threatening to defeat the purpose of significant portions of the corporations legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill adopts those recommendations by removing the derivative use immunity from subsection 68(3) of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989, and from subsection 597(12) of the Corporations Law contained in section 82 of the Corporations Act 1989. It removes the immunity in respect of the fact that a person had produced a document from subsection 68(3) of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989, and confines the availability of the remaining use immunity to natural persons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under proposed section 1316A of the Corporations Law, a body corporate will not be entitled to claim the privilege against self-incrimination, nor claim that it may make itself liable to a penalty, in any Corporations Law criminal proceedings. Nor may it claim privilege or acquire any immunity under proposed subsections 68(3) or 597(12) and (12A).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The removal of the right to claim the privilege against self-incrimination from bodies corporate in the legislation is to overcome the uncertainty resulting from the decision of the High Court of Australia in Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1983) 152 CLR 328 where it was assumed, but not decided, that the common law privilege against selfincrimination applied to corporations. In that case Murphy J (at p. 346) expressed the view that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the privilege is personal, so that one required to produce documents cannot resist production on the ground that this would tend to incriminate another. The history and reasons for the privilege do not justify its extension to artificial persons such as corporations or political entities. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government endorses this view, and that of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, which said at paragraph 4.5 of it's report, that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Companies are artificial legal entities occupying a privileged position in that all companies are protected by limited liability and public companies may seek investment from the public. . . . This privileged position carries with it obligations of accountability which may require the restriction of the rights of those participating in the corporate sector, including the right to remain silent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill does not, however, adopt a further recommendation of the Committee, that there be a five year sunset clause on these amendments. The reason for not following that recommendation is that serious problems could arise in the prosecution of matters which may have been under investigation for some time. Investigators in complex cases would be hampered by the uncertainty of not knowing which rule of evidence would apply at the time of trial, and prosecutions not completed when the immunities revive would be jeopardised by the inadmissibility of crucial evidence. This would involve not only considerable expense in wasted resources over a long period of time, but would also significantly detract from the Government's public commitment to more effective law enforcement in the corporate area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A preferable alternative is to ensure that the operation of the amendments is reviewed within a specified period, and Cabinet has decided that an appropriate period is five years. Thus, in accordance with that decision the operation of these amendments will be reviewed after five years of operation. However, the Government has given its commitment that their operation will be monitored and an interim review will take place after twelve months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is committed to the objective of ensuring that the law can not be used to protect from prosecution those individuals who direct corporate activity and who have breached the law. I believe that the solution represented by the Bill appropriately balances the competing interests of civil liberties, inherited from centuries of the common law and fundamental to our system of criminal justice, with the responsibility of the Government to ensure that the laws of the Parliament are properly enforceable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Effective corporate regulation in Australia requires legislation with teeth, in the form of criminal provisions which can be enforced. The Australian community expects corporate malfeasors to be exposed to the full ambit of the criminal justice system, not shielded from it by legislation, and that is the intention of the amendments contained in this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposals put forward in this Bill do not have an impact on Government expenditure.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) and the Poultry Industry Assistance Amendment Bill, not so much to talk on the actual business of the Bills but to use them as a vehicle for discussion on the poultry industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the Poultry Industry Assistance Amendment Bill is to clean up old legislation under which debts from a previous arrangement have been unpaid. The hen levy as it was is no longer operative. There are still outstanding debts dating back prior to 1990 when the trust fund was wound up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the importation of poultry meat, the question of quarantine and so on. Prior to 1990, the Australian Poultry Industries Association and the Australian Chicken Meat Federation had been involved in discussions with AQIS and its predecessors concerning the importation of poultry products into Australia. There had been discussions concerning importations from the United States and New Zealand, and, in every case, it was the quarantine aspects that dominated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the question of newcastle disease, avian influenza and various other lesser known diseases, which are very real as far as the poultry industry is concerned and very important in retaining Australia's disease-free status in this area compared with the other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 16 March 1990, AQIS advised that it had been approached by the governments of the United States, New Zealand, Thailand and Denmark to allow the importation of either cooked or frozen poultry products. AQIS went on to announce that it was conducting a full quarantine risk assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is well-known throughout the world for its very generous quarantine assessments. The industry started to become nervous as to what might happen in this case. In due course, in April 1991, the risk assessment discussion paper was distributed with a response requested by 14 July. The fact that it was heavily dealt with by the industry meant that the date had to be extended somewhat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry itself produced its own study, known as the Larkin report, and discussions have proceeded since then. The industry contacted Minister Crean and Minister Griffiths, various State Ministers of agriculture and health, as well as AQIS, to emphasise the effect of significant changes to quarantine and what such changes might do to the Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In due course, on 3 December 1991, AQIS advised that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . consideration of the quarantine and public health issues associated with the importation of chicken products is still in progress. The work to date has concentrated on cooked product and we are still considering comments from interested parties on our discussion paper.</PARA>
<PARA>So the issue still rambles on. The concern for public health issues and the concern for industry quarantine issues are not quite the same, although they certainly overlap. It is necessary that they should be considered individually.The letter from AQIS went on to say:</PARA>

<PARA>But as I say, we still ramble on, inexorably heading in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is free of the various strains of newcastle disease. The last outbreak that we had of the virulent strain was in the early 1930s. Australia is also one of the few countries that does not allow the vaccination of any poultry against newcastle disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent AQIS discussion paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A qualitative assessment of current exotic disease risks for Australia</EMPHASIS> rates <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>newcastle disease, along with avian influenza and bluetongue, in the highest priority group of diseases for exotic animal disease risk. One of the four ways it suggests that exotic newcastle disease could enter Australia is in foodstuffs containing infected poultry carcass material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really do not see that there is any necessity for Australia at this stage even to consider the importation of poultry carcass material. But we still persist. The report went on to say that frozen poultry carcasses were an important mode of the spread of the virulent newcastle disease from one country to another in the 1940s and 1950s. The 1990 AQIS paper suggests that, once the virus had entered the country, there is no reason why virulent newcastle disease would not become established in Australia and spread very rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attitude that goes with so much of this is that we have to accept what is an acceptable level of risk. With diseases such as newcastle disease, foot and mouth disease and the like, the acceptable level of risk is zero&mdash;not zero plus one or 0.001, but zero. There is no reason in the world for Australia at this stage to run the risk of absolutely decimating what has now become a very well controlled and very well run business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should there be an outbreak of newcastle disease, the costs would be absolutely enormous and the destruction in the industry would be very high. The loss of standing as far as the Australian industry is concerned would be most damaging. The effect on wildlife is also something that has not really been checked and would be impossible to determine. If the disease could not be quickly eradicated, massive costs associated with mortality and loss of production due to the clinical disease, with purchasing and applying of vaccines and loss of trade, would be incurred on an ongoing basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Insufficient knowledge of the effects upon, and the spread of disease in, native bird species means that the effect on the bird population would, as I say, be inestimable. The Chicken Meat Research and Development Council and the Egg Industry Research and Development Council and their predecessors have spent $1.6m on newcastle disease-related research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have always had in mind that it is possible that, for some unknown reason, the disease could come to Australia. We certainly do not want to bring it in by some known means. We do not want to open up the industry to such an extent that it could suffer as a result of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all these reasons, the Australian poultry industry totally opposes the importation of poultry products from countries known to have newcastle disease. It also totally opposes the importation from any country that routinely vaccinates poultry against newcastle disease. It is well recognised that vaccinated, apparently healthy birds may still harbour or shed the virulent strain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four countries have made application to export poultry products to Australia: Thailand, the United States, Denmark and New Zealand. The status of newcastle disease in Thailand and the USA should automatically eliminate those countries as possible exporters of poultry products to Australia. The exact situation in Denmark is still unclear, but as from 1992 Denmark will be fully integrated into the European Community which will act as a single trading unit, and we must, therefore, assess the disease status of the EC as a whole when considering Denmark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we can consider avian influenza, which is another exotic disease of great concern to the poultry industry and is ranked alongside newcastle disease as one of the top three exotic animal disease risks for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not understand why it is that we are still spending a lot of time and a lot of money, and doing a lot more investigations to see how we can go about opening the doors to imports. I do not believe in using quarantine as an embargo, as a non-tariff barrier, but I certainly believe that this Government and this Parliament owes its first allegiance to its own industry. Why do we not just say, `The risk is too great. We are not prepared to run those sorts of risks and, accordingly, we do not see it as appropriate that we should change our policy at all on the importation of either cooked or raw and frozen poultry products'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry itself now comprises 1,400 or 1,500 major establishments evenly divided between egg and meat production. It is an industry which now employs 45,000 to 50,000 people. The assets of the industry are worth about $1,400m, and that is on the basis of there being between 55 million and 60 million birds. The industry produces 400,000 tonnes of poultry meat and over 180 million dozen eggs a year. It is a very important industry in many rural and outer suburban areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The poultry industry has done a great job in its own promotion and presentation into the households of Australia. Consumption has risen from 4.4 kilograms per person per year in 1950 to 25.2 kilograms per person in 1990. This is, of course, white meat, which healthy people would tell us is better than steak&mdash;I have my personal reservations on that. Consumption of chicken meat is now second only to beef in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry does not intend to try to require the Government to object to imports on any grounds other than that of the risk to the industry itself. It is not worth bringing in products that will produce risks to the consumer and it certainly is not worth bringing into Australia anything that will run the risk of decimating or seriously damaging an industry which, over the last 20 or 30 years, has made such an effort to get its house in order&mdash;to rationalise; to become modern, effective and efficient&mdash;and which has spent considerable amounts of money on research and on producing the best birds possible for the purpose for which they are required. Accordingly, I will certainly support any move that will result in curtailing the extension of the import of poultry products. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak on the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), I wish to begin by making some comments concerning the amendments to the Meat Inspection Act. While these amendments streamline certain procedures, one must take the opportunity of emphasising the point that our current meat inspection arrangements are badly in need of overhaul. It is absolutely imperative, given that there is a 100 per cent recovery of costs in terms of the meat industry, that many of the inefficiencies in the meat inspection service be addressed. In addition, a significant number of meat inspectors are still in the employ of the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service, AQIS, and the industry is picking up the costs of those surplus meat inspectors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time has come for a major overhaul of the whole meat inspection or quarantine inspection services. While the industry has the 100 per cent recovery cost in terms of those inspectors and the service that is provided, it is entitled to a much greater say in terms of future directions. The time has come for the modernisation of the inspection service to get the inspectors themselves&mdash;and I am not arguing about the necessity of inspection for the export or domestic consumption of our meat products&mdash;tied to the various meatworks and become an integral part of the abattoirs operation. It is only by progressing down that path that we will maximise the productivity of meat inspectors and lower the costs involved. Currently the costs per man in the industry are as much as $93,000 per year, which is a very high cost for a service that is over-manned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to take this opportunity whilst debating the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill&mdash;particularly in view of the current debate concerning tariffs&mdash;to try to put a balanced view on the position as it impacts on the industry. I wish to do this against the background of a number of aspects and state why it is important that we continue to have a reduction in tariffs across the board in rural and other industries. Together with those reductions in tariffs, it is imperative that the cost imposts on agricultural industries&mdash;the various primary industries&mdash;whether it be the sugar, beef, wool, wheat or the poultry industry that Senator Archer referred to&mdash;be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When talking about tariffs, it must be noted that the cost in Australia of the current tariff regime is about $8,000 per farm per year. This enormous tax has to be paid up front in terms of the protection provided to a number of industries in Australia. It was with much dismay last week that I read and heard of the backflip by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on his previous position on tariffs. Some three or four years ago&mdash;or maybe a little longer when I was on the executive of the National Farmers Federation&mdash;I heard the Prime Minister, when he was Treasurer, actually say that his policy position, in terms of having an efficient economy in Australia and taking us towards becoming internationally competitive, was that in time, and in the not too far distant future, we must phase out tariffs totally in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister also mentioned at that time the need to get the input costs to industry down. During that time, which would have been about 1984-85, he was advocating the introduction of a consumption tax. That is another one of his big backflips. If we look at what has occurred in recent days in terms of further amendments to the wholesale sales tax and a report that was presented to Senator Button yesterday, we realise that there are at least some advisers within the Government who recognise the importance of moving our tax base, lowering income tax rates and introducing a consumption tax. I wanted to put that on the public record because I was there when Mr Keating, as Treasurer, made that statement. It was more than a statement; it was a commitment. But that commitment has gone down the drain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at tariffs in a little more detail and the impact of that $8,000 and compare the difference between the situation in the Australian farm sector and the situation in the US and the EC where there are very high levels of protection for the farm sector. In the EC the attrition rate&mdash;those being phased out of agriculture in the EC, despite its high levels of protection&mdash;has been running at about 16 per cent per year for a number of years. In the United States of America&mdash;the so-called bastion of free enterprise&mdash;which provides very high levels of protection for the farm sector through the farm Bill, through EEP and through other programs, the attrition rate is about 14 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, where protection for the farm sector is much lower, has an attrition rate of about 6 per cent. In our larger industries&mdash;in saying our larger industries, I am not decrying the smaller industries&mdash;such as wheat, wool and beef, which have negligible levels of protection or assistance, losses are even less than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tariffs, in terms of the farming industry, and also in terms of the individual in the street, are in effect a consumer tax. I have already highlighted the fact that there is a cost of some $8,000 per farm. The current tariff protection for the car industry costs consumers about $4,000 per car. If we look a little further down the track we find that, across the board, tariffs costs the average household about $16 a week. When people debate tariff policy, they must realise that protection for one person or for one industry is just a transfer across the board to another industry or individual of a consumer tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is required in terms of our position on agriculture today? We have to be realistic about the situation in Europe and the United States vis-a-vis the GATT round and a number of other activities. In terms of the world tariff debate, very shortly&mdash;I think on 1 May&mdash;Japan will reduce its tariffs on beef by some 10 per cent, which will significantly benefit the Australian industry. It will allow some additional increase into the Japanese market but, more importantly, it will allow, over time, Australian producers to receive a higher price for their product, which will be flow across the board. It is totally irresponsible, after having won that debate with the Japanese and moving into other areas, for those in the Australian community to start talking up tariffs and presenting them as a panacea to many of our problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, it is a transfer from one consumer to the other or from one industry to the other. While we might protect a few jobs in one particular industry, this will be done at the cost&mdash;I emphasise this point&mdash;of jobs in another industry. An analysis of the whole tariff situation shows that tariffs have produced very few jobs in Australia; in fact, they have not protected the jobs of those people who work in protected industries. I refer to the much quoted textiles, clothing and footwear industry. In 1990, when levels of protection were very high, the industry shed some 17,000 jobs. The current debate is being fuelled by the Prime Minister's back flip on tariffs as a result of the Wills by-election, and the attempt by the Democrats today to debate in this place the issue. Somebody else in another electorate will have to pay for any increased tariffs in Wills. Any gain in jobs in Wills will, on a pro rata basis, be made at the expense of jobs in some other electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To remain competitive in agriculture&mdash;and this applies across the board&mdash;we need to get our costs and our input taxes down. As outlined in the Fightback program, the wholesale sales tax impact needs to be taken off the backs of those people who are producing. Not only the direct cost of the wholesale sales tax but also the indirect costs of this tax flow through the system. Another tax that we intend to remove is payroll tax. We will take away the liability from the States in terms of raising money through payroll tax. Incidentally, every Premier in this country has called for the replacement of payroll tax because it is a tax on employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The flow-on impact of these taxes on the road transport industry is in the order of $53,000 per rig per year. That cost has to be picked up down the track and, in the final analysis, it is passed on to the producer. The effect of these taxes flows through to the various service industries which repair and supply second-hand or new machinery. Once again, this cost is picked up finally by the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers across Australia have to pick up on average $8,000 per year in flow-on consumer taxes as a result of tariffs. This is in addition to the flow-on costs of wholesale sales tax, payroll tax, fuel excise and all the other indirect taxes that sit in the system. The Opposition proposes in the Fightback package that these taxes should be taken out of the system. Industry costs&mdash;whether they be in agriculture, manufacturing or mining&mdash;have to be lowered so that the industries can have a cost structure that will enable them to be world competitive. It is worth noting that our competitors, particularly the EEC and the United States which have high levels of protection, do not have to pay those costs. So not only do they have a very high level of protection, which is a transfer from the taxpayer to the farm sector in those coutnries, but also they do not have the burden that we have of a high level of input costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must get the cost burden down so that our industries can compete. The answer does not lie in going down the tariff route. The tariff route means a transfer from one industry or one individual to another. In the long term that will exacerbate the problem and probably lead Australia into a position where our industries will suffer the same level of attrition as industries in the EC and United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the answer lies in the modernisation of our meat industry. Meat inspection costs in other countries are in the order of 40 or 50 per cent less than they are in Australia. One could talk about this for a significant length of time&mdash;I do not intend to do so&mdash;but I will say that in dealing with meat inspection costs one must also recognise that that is not the only area where cost structure and cost problems have to be addressed. Despite the Harrison report and all we have heard in this chamber about industrial reform in our meat industry, our killing costs are between three to two to one and a half times that of other countries, depending on whom we compare ourselves with in terms of the world situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise the importance of the removal of input taxes on Australian farmers, as outlined in the Fightback package. I want to emphasise the point that the introduction of tariff regimes, particularly when one is trying to relate them to industries pertinent to the upcoming by-election, is just a straight transfer from one industry or one individual to another in terms of consumer tax. However, the biggest flaw in all this is that it means that somebody is trying to pick winners. There is no evidence to suggest that when it comes to being world competitive, one can actually decide that a particular industry should be protected and that another should not. What inevitably happens is that the protected industries get into a cocoon and become inefficient and too cosy with the position they are in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As previous speakers have said, the Opposition is supporting these Bills. I finalise my comments by saying that, while the changes to this Bill are desirable and welcome, as is usual with Bills relating to agriculture, not enough emphasis in the current debate is placed on the importance of getting our costs down in the farming sector. We should be making our meat inspection service and our meat slaughter systems, or abattoirs, competitive and effective by removing input taxes, which are an enormous burden on the Australian farming sector. I also emphasise the importance of not turning the clock back on tariffs and having the $8,000 per farm increase again when it should be decreasing at a very rapid rate. </PARA>

The Migration Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1991 proposes to amend the Migration Act 1958 to make changes to the merits review system, distinguish the power to detain a person under the Act, increase certain penalty provisions in line with Commonwealth criminal law policy, allow consistent application of pecuniary penalties under the Crimes Act 1914, and provide that the obligation to endorse a visa or entry permit will be satisfied by an endorsement being recorded in a notified database.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has no difficulty or problem with these amendments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sensible to tidy up the references to powers of arrest so that they are changed to read, `detain in custody', and so that no confusion remains over the restrictions of arrest as set out in the Crimes Act 1914.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment which changes an obvious marked endorsement on a visa or entry permit of someone suffering from, for example, a prescribed physical or medical condition to a simple record on a departmental database is also sensible in its desire to preserve privacy and negate any potential for embarrassment.

That creates confusion for not only the legislators but also the departmental staff located throughout this country and overseas who attempt to abide by the Act and the regulations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with pleasure that I speak after my South Australian colleague Senator Olsen. I very much support his summation of the Migration Amendment Bill (No.4) 1991. In fact, the clauses are capable of bipartisan support in this chamber because they strengthen legislation in the national interest. This debate gives the Senate an opportunity to discuss the Government's immigration policies. I wish to briefly draw attention to two major areas of weakness in the administration of immigration by this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I first want to note that there has been too much change, too much reworking of regulations, in the past three years since I was a member of the parliamentary committee set up to review migration regulations. There has been enormous complication and variation because of the changes that have been introduced. The Government got a lot of things wrong and it has been too slow in making the repairs necessary to make the Act work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why we refer to regulations in this area so much is that for the new Act to work, it requires a huge volume of subsidiary legislation which is in the form of regulations; that is, not provisions which are directly debated in the Parliament but provisions which are formulated and published by the Government with advice from the Parliament's Joint Committee on Migration Regulations, subject to a possible disallowance by Parliament. So the regulations under the Migration Act are now enormously complicated and enormously detailed, and, as I say, in these recent years we have been enormously taxing upon the thousands of public servants who are required to administer the Act and the regulations through the volume of changes that have been necessary because the Government did not get it right in the beginning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two matters in Migration Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1991 that I want to refer to. One is the new section 121A. I welcome the amendment. It makes clearer the situation which will be followed when a case is being reviewed; that is, where an applicant has been denied immigration and is then appealing for a review of the original decision. The regulations to be taken into account when an appeal is being considered are to be those which are the more beneficial to the applicant, whether they be those in effect at the time of the first decision on the case or those applying when the appeal is under consideration. That appears to be just. It certainly is to the advantage of the applicant. So this clarification by that amendment is one that I welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer, as Senator Olsen did, to the updating of the penalty provisions in the Act. It happens that penalties in Acts can go unreviewed for a period and, after a while, can become out of date. It is therefore desirable that this Bill addresses the matter of penalties in the Migration Act and seeks to bring them into line with the general approach of the Commonwealth to penalties in criminal law as set out in section 4B(2) of the Crimes Act. The increase in the level of financial penalties emphasises the seriousness with which the Parliament views breaches of the Migration Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Maintaining the integrity of our immigration policy is a recurring theme of mine. I think anyone who wanted to bother himself would find that in a dozen speeches on immigration here in the Senate in recent years the integrity of the immigration program is something that I have referred to on every occasion. I believe that the Australian public does not have confidence in the present Government's administration of immigration. It does not have confidence that we do have an immigration program that has integrity. It seems to be not fair to all comers from wherever they may apply. It seems to me to be one of the essential goals that we all should press towards&mdash;whether from the Australian Democrats, from the present Government or from the future government. We should so back up the legislation, the decisions of this chamber and the other in the Parliament, and so enact, fairly in every part of the world, the immigration regulations, that people applying to come to live in Australia could be assured that they are being dealt with in exactly the same way, whether their applications came from one country or another, and so that the whole system of immigration decisions had a ring of integrity about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There are two present concerns of mine that I now wish to refer to which go beyond this increase in the penalties that are required to ensure that there is a deterrent for those who are breaking our immigration laws. I certainly welcome the increase in the penalties. I certainly welcome the increased signal this gives that we are intent about a deterrent to those who would break Australian law in the immigration area and that we are seeking to have integrity for our immigration program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the two major elements undermining the soundness of our immigration program are squarely at the feet of the present Labor Government here in Canberra. One is the result of the present recession. It appears that when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was Treasurer, he regarded Australia as needing a recession. He certainly has been the one most responsible for the recession that we have: one million unemployed; a $160 billion national debt; a huge current account problem; a country that is going broke; and suffering in every State and every city and  area of Australia. In the context of this recession, the Government has not adjusted the immigration program to take account of the recession that it has placed upon Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I share with those in the Opposition a call even now for the Government to cut the immigration program so that we do not have applicants coming from various countries, immigrating to Australia with high hopes that they will make a new world for themselves, a new world of prosperity for their family and a contribution to this country, only to find that when they arrive there is a degree of recession that they had not expected and that they are on the dole queue, that they are unemployed and that their dreams are shattered, and that they are not only adding to the burden on the Australian taxpayer, but also they are themselves the victims of being lured to immigrate to a country that at the moment does not have a huge amount to offer them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all of my 14 years in the Senate I have  advocated high immigration&mdash;but always a responsibly high amount. I have seen immigration since the Second World War as one of the factors that has led to the economic development of this country. I say `responsibly high' because the figure must be a number which Australia is able to integrate successfully. If we had so great a number of immigrants that we were not capable as an economy and as a social community of ensuring that they made a transition into fully productive and prosperous families within Australia, then the number would be too high. I, as someone who wants a high immigration program in normal times, am calling for a lower immigration figure because it is irresponsible to add to the dole queues and to add to the misery of victims of a recession, those who have newly arrived in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Government has recently been urged by the ACTU to cut the immigration program by 10 per cent&mdash;by, I think, some 11,000. When I read Mr Ferguson's remarks&mdash;and, of course, the trade unions are very close allies of the Government; some of my colleagues regard them as the real government of Australia&mdash;I saw that the ACTU is putting forward the view that this Government has been too slow to recognise that in a recession there is a need to cut the numbers. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. In order to ensure the integrity of our immigration program as a successful program, a reliable program, and one that people can build their lives upon when making decisions to come to this country; and in order not to create further victims of the recession beyond the one million Australians who are unemployed; we need to cut the immigration numbers much more than the ACTU has advocated this week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw attention to two other elements of the ACTU's recommendations. The first is to emphasise English language requirements in the intake of those successful applicants for immigration to Australia. It was fashionable about five to 10 years ago amongst the members of the present Government to downgrade the test of English language requirements because they were supposing that this was an indirect way of discriminating against those whose mother tongue was not English but some other language&mdash;as if it was some small shadow of the old and now totally discarded White Australia policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party performed a disservice when its ranks took up that fashion five to 10 years ago. We all need to look squarely at the practical elements of those applicants who are coming to Australia and to note, very honestly, that it is a requirement for success in this country to be fluent in English. Priority ought to be given to those applicants who have English language as a skill that equips them to be more successful when they come to this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have adult and child migrant English education programs, but that is only to ensure that those who come, having won priority for other reasons, cannot be disadvantaged in their actual lives here in Australia. We give them the bridge to gain English language abilities when they are here. But, in the program itself, we need to give greater weight to English language as a requirement for successful application. I note as well that it is skills&mdash;marketable, employable skills&mdash;that go beyond English language as the requirement that ought to gain priority for applicants when they are applying to immigrate to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to see the immigration program work not only to the advantage of those successful applicants who want to come and live in this country but also, very clearly, to the advantage of Australia's national interest. Those that will have the best economic effect upon this country from the immigration program are those who come here with well developed skills&mdash;with expertise&mdash;that they will then use to the betterment of this country. Again, we need to go right back to the Fitzgerald report, to a whole range of signals in the last five years, to get the balance more weighted in favour of skilled migration to this country to the benefit of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having directly criticised the Government with regard to the effect of the recession and the need to cut immigration, I finally turn to the vexed problem of the Chinese students in Australia before and since the Tiananmen Square massacre of June 1989. There has been some disastrous news this month, and that is the revealing by the Government in answer to Opposition questions of a total blow-out of numbers in the overstay of Chinese students in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am the Vice President in this Parliament of the Australia-China Friendship Association. I have visited China on numerous occasions. Honourable senators will know that I was one who advocated in February last year the normalising of relations between Australia and China to the benefit of both of our countries. But I am equally strong in my remarks about the integrity of Australia's immigration program. I am equally emphatic that, when overseas students come to study in Australia, they do so on the basis that they will gain skills and return to use those skills in their own country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of China, we have had tens of thousands of students who have come, studied in Australia, gained professional skills as well as English language reinforcements and gone back to serve in China&mdash;except for those who, by this present Labor Government, have been given an easy road, a short cut. I believe it was an unsound decision that they should be able to remain in Australia despite the undertaking they gave that they would return to China, and despite Australia's alleged commitment to an overseas student program which would return students to their own countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bad news of this month is this: we all knew about a first group, that is, some 21,000 Chinese students who were in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre in June 1989. Many of us were critical, but we understood the emotions that had swayed the hearts of those in the Government to give a blanket extension of visas to those 21,000 students for four years, in order to work out whether or not they were to gain refugee status in this country or whether they would, in some other way, become permanent residents of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time about 2,000 of those students have left Australia and 19,000 of that group are still here. The bad news this month is that since the Tiananmen Square massacre, 44,644 Chinese nationals arrived in Australia&mdash;24,838 of them were students, the others were non-students&mdash;and only 16,382 of these have left, only 2,125 of them being students. That leaves a balance of 28,262 who are overstaying. These overstayers are not the students who were here when the Tiananmen Square massacre happened; they are Chinese citizens who have arrived since the massacre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have two groups. The total of the two groups is not just 19,000 of the original group, but the total of 47,262 who remain in Australia. </PARA>

So, without consultation and without addressing his mind to the repercussions that this would have in undermining the integrity of the Australian immigration program, by a wave of the arm&mdash;literally&mdash;an extension of visas was granted to all those students. Because it is hard to differentiate the present situation of those who have arrived since the Tiananmen Square massacre from the situation of those who arrived before it, the wave of the arm applies to them as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So almost 50,000 Chinese residents have, by a wave of the arm, gained residence in Australia. For some it will be temporary residence, but that is still to be seen. The Government has not delivered. The Government has not clarified what will happen with regard to these 50,000 Chinese students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to go on too long about this. I would rather sit down and allow other senators to speak on this immigration Bill. I just want to make it entirely clear that if there is a genuine refugee amongst those 50,000&mdash;that is, a person who can demonstrate that his or her life or livelihood would be in jeopardy were he or she required to return to China&mdash;Australia can respond as it does to every other genuine refugee in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only my estimate but also, I believe, the estimate of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and of Chinese students themselves that at least 95 per cent of the 50,000 I have referred to would not jeopardise their lives or livelihoods were they to return to China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have advocated since June 1989 that there be a case-by-case review of the applicants by an administrative method which did not require one person laboriously going over 50,000 applications but which instead, in a properly systematic way, dealt with categories of applicants expeditiously. It was my hope that it would be all completely determined by now. However, this Government is out of control. It has not made any hard decisions in this matter. It is still relying upon former Prime Minister Hawke's wave of the arm. This is a totally unresolved element of Australia's immigration program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a signal going to all parts of the world that if people who get to Australia have some kind of excuse on which to build a refugee application, they should go for their lives for they may be able to succeed. If they employ private sector lawyers, they can at least delay through appeals and get an extended stay and, even if they lose, they get a couple of years of all the benefits of living in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian public does not have confidence in the present Labor Government's administration of immigration. It does not have confidence either on the recession grounds to which I referred or on the complete blow-out with regard to the Chinese students in this country. I wish every individual Chinese student well in his or her future. I hope most of them return to their country and contribute positively to it without any kind of deterrent or impediment to their professional work there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not table here some correspondence I have received in the last few weeks, which I am sure the Department is very aware of, from Chinese students who are writing to members of parliament saying, `Let me make it clear. I know my community. The reason 50,000 Chinese want to stay in Australia is exactly the same as the reason everyone else wants to stay in Australia&mdash;they love the place. They think it is a way to have a better life. They like the affluence of Australia. They want to make their lives here because their children will have a better future in this country than if they returned to the Third World comforts of China'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not denying their aspiration to live in Australia. Of course I recognise that so many who are here illegally or in undetermined status would love to remain in Australia. But so do about 50 million people in the world. The whole point of an immigration program is to ensure that there is fairness, integrity and a rational determination of the priorities of applicants&mdash;and the same outcome for an applicant from one country as from another. That is what is smelling at the moment. That is what is not happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does not the present Government recognise the equal claims by the Lebanese, the Filipinos, the English, the Germans, the Irish and every other kind of applicant who wants to live in Australia and who recognises that this is a great place for their children and a place where they can make a contribution?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats also support the substance of the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1991, which is to clarify and make fairer the administration of the way Australia deals with those people who have come into the country, who may come into the country or who may not be able to remain in the country. We strongly support the increased fairness and clarity with which these matters are to be dealt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reflect the remarks of Senator Baden Teague, who has just spoken, in this regard and stress that the Democrats would always support any move to make those matters clearer, fairer and less restrictive. They should also be applied equally to people who come from any part of the world. There should be no discrimination on the grounds of race, sex, religion or any of those other things built into our immigration system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Senator Baden Teague made some remarks about the aspect of immigration relating to numbers. He, like his Leader and the ACTU, calls for a reduction in the size of the immigration program. I would like to direct a few remarks to that question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats adopted in 1977, and have been working out in considerably more detail, what it means for Australia to move towards an ecologically sustainable pattern of development for future generations who live in this country, from wherever they may come. The options in terms of the environment and availability of resources will be no less than the options which are available to the present generation. That is, after all, what sustainability means; it is what inter-generational equity, on which sustainability is based, ultimately means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the Government and the Opposition have paid lip-service to the idea of sustainability, but have failed totally to recognise that the size of the population which is acting on the environment is one major component of that impact; and that, before one has an immigration program at all, one needs to develop a population policy. That is something that this country has totally failed to do. We have had an immigration program now since 1947; we have never, as a nation, developed a population policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of sustainability, I think it is manifest to everybody that the pattern of exploitation in Australia is not sustainable in the long run. We are degrading the ability of our land to produce food; we have increasing soil erosion; we have increasing salinisation; and we are decreasing the ability of this country's water supply to continue to meet the needs of even the present population. We have seen our water supplies become increasingly polluted. We have seen in the last year the spread of blue-green algae into the Murray-Darling system on which Adelaide ultimately depends for its backup water supply. We have seen, in the case of Perth, the gradual rundown of the aquifers underlying that city and on which its water supply depends, and we have seen progressive pollution of those aquifers. We have seen increasing salinisation of those aquifers as they become both polluted and depressed, because Perth, after all, is built on a very sandy coastal plain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those things indicate that if the present population of this country continues to make the demands on the environment which it currently does, the environment will not be sustainable. In other words, we are, by that measure of sustainability, already an over-populated country. That is why we need desperately to develop a population policy. We need to try to work out at what level of resource use&mdash;at what level of impact in terms of demand for resources and the pollution consequent upon the exploitation and the disposal of those resources&mdash;we can maintain an industrial civilisation in this country over the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having worked out that level per capita, then what size of population is consistent with that, bearing in mind that we are committed to ensuring, I hope, that there will be a viable and worthwhile lifestyle still present for our descendants in this country&mdash;not in 10 years time or in 50 years time, but in 1,000 years time, in 10,000 years time and in one million years time; that people will still be able to inhabit this country without loss of the quality of life which we have come to enjoy and on which, ultimately, the welfare of human beings as animals depends. One of the most depressing aspects of the migration reviews which go on is that we do not find biologists and ecologists built into that review process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make an appeal to the Government to develop, as a matter of urgency, a population policy. It must look quite seriously at the changes in the demography of the Australian population. It must look at what is happening to the age structure of the Australian population; what is happening to that age structure if we have substantial increases in immigration rates for some years and then, for whatever reason, we substantially cut those rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens in that event is that we have a cohort of people who move through the population all ageing at the same time and we produce the very problems that many people have argued we need to avoid in terms of an excessive number of ageing people in the community not supported by a sufficient number of young people. It is, as it were, a reverse of the situation we had after the Second World War when we had a baby boom. Suddenly we found that we had to build a lot of schools, which a few years later were empty. We had made a large investment in resources which were then being under-utilised. When those baby-boomers themselves produced children, we had another mini baby boom, and we had a damped recurrence of the same thing. We needed to build more facilities for child education which a few years down the track were not required. In a similar way, if we have a cohort of people who all age together, not followed on by another cohort of people of roughly the same size, we will build a lot of facilities for aged people which then in a few years time we will not need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the call which has come from some members of the Opposition for a complete cessation of immigration simply does not take into account those sorts of factors. If we are going to build a population policy, we must look at that policy over a very long period. It cannot be a short term policy. Because people live 70 to 80 years, a population policy has to look at what will happen over at least 100 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put a few figures to this, what will happen to Australia's population under various possible scenarios? It is often and quite incorrectly said that if we were to cut our immigration rate to zero now, our population would immediately start falling simply because the net reproduction rate of Australians is below one, below replacement. That conclusion is totally false and ignores the fact that the majority of the Australian population is younger than a population at stability. We have more young women still to enter their reproductive years than we have older women who are dying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, without any immigration at all into this country, population would still increase by about three million people and then would go into slow decline, if the net reproduction rate remained at about 0.9, where it is now. But it would not get back to 17 million people until about 100 years from now. So the idea that the population would suddenly fall because we had no immigration is simply false and is not borne out by demographic analysis. Similarly, when the former Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, was asked what he thought an optimal population for Australia might be, he gave the figure of 25 million. That is a figure which many other people have used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present rates of immigration would see us pass 25 million and wave goodbye to it around the year 2,030 with no hope of ever getting back to it. If we want to stabilise at about 25 million people, we need to cut quite seriously the present immigration rate. So I make the point that we need to develop a population policy for this country and, having done that, to look at what sort of immigration program in terms of numbers would fit with that population policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress again that the Democrats in no sense blame immigrants for any environmental damage which has occurred in this country; it is not the immigrants who are responsible for the immigration program; it is the Government. If the increase in population causes environmental problems, it is the Government which has caused the population increase by pursuing a program of population increase through immigration. Migrants are not responsible for environmental damage. Similarly, those who do come into this country should never be selected on any grounds which relate to race, religion, creed, sex or any other discriminatory factor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where we would differ very markedly from both the Government and the Opposition is in meeting our humanitarian responsibilities. We believe that the immigration program should be based around refugees, and around family reunion. It should not be about skills, or a reconstructed business migration program&mdash;if that should get under way. Skills have been used as an argument for immigration to this country ever since 1947. It is an indictment of successive governments in this country that apparently we still need skilled people to come into this country. We should have a much better educational and training program in this country for Australians, so that we do not need to bring in people with skills from outside. It is about time we trained Australians more adequately, so that we do not feel a need to bring in people from other countries. In relation to business migration, certainly as it was constructed, I think enough has been said about the rorts and the damage which that program did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of refugees, I pick up a remark of Senator Baden Teague where he quite clearly identified refugees as being those people who temporarily cannot remain in their own country for fear of action being taken against them which threatens their life or their livelihood. The Democrats believe that Australia should bring in a much larger number of refugees, bearing in mind that they may well be people who later on could return to their own country, but in the meantime need succour. As far as the family reunion program is concerned, it is obvious that having brought people into this country, it is only fair that those people at least should be allowed to bring close family into Australia. I would argue that the program does need to be cut, but cut along lines which are based on long term sustainability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in my opening remarks, this Bill does go to a number of matters which relate to the fairness and transparency with which migrants, intending migrants, and those who have found themselves on the wrong side of the immigration law, are dealt.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this Bill is to provide for a single Act imposing levies on coarse grains for the purpose of funding research. The Bill incorporates the existing barley and triticale levies and extends the coverage of coarse grains to oats and cereal rye. The levies will attract matching Commonwealth contributions as provided for under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development (PIERD) Act 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These arrangements are being implemented at the request of the Grains Council of Australia (GCA) on behalf of coarse grain producers after consultations with other relevant industry bodies, including the Triticale Grain Association of Australia which is the representative industry body under the Triticale Levy Act 1988. The GCA is currently the representative industry body for barley and has been nominated as such for oats and cereal rye.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, barley and triticale research levies have been imposed under separate Acts which, in the main, are only differentiated by product specific provisions. The oats and cereal rye levy arrangements will be similar. Consequently, omnibus levy legislation has been developed covering these grains with provision for other coarse grains to be added by regulation having regard to any recommendation of the relevant growers' organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Barley Research Levy Act 1980 and the Triticale Levy Act 1988 will be repealed under the related Coarse Grains Levy (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1992, which includes provisions to ensure continuity of current levy arrangements for these grains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Implementing research levies for oats and cereal rye represents an extension of the Government's policy of encouraging increased contributions by primary industry for rural research which was established in 1985. The Government made a commitment to continue matching expenditure of approved industry levies on a dollar for dollar basis up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production (GVP) of the relevant industry. This policy was reaffirmed in the May 1989 Government statement, "Research Innovation and Competitiveness".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the new crops to be levied, oats production has, in recent seasons, varied between 1.4 and 1.6 million tonnes per year with the gross value of production averaging $172 million in the three years to 1991/92. Production is centred mainly in Western Australia (estimated at 32 per cent in 1991/92), New South Wales (28 per cent), Victoria (19 per cent) and South Australia (19 per cent).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The greater proportion of the oats crop&mdash;an estimated 72 per cent in 1991/92&mdash;is used on the domestic market where oats have long been an important supplement to the successful operation of grazing enterprises involving sheep and cattle. Oats are used either as a grazing supplement and for fodder reserves, or for the production of hay and silage. Export sales of grain, which average around 220,000 tonnes annually, are also an important outlet which is expected to earn around $32 million in 1991/92.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to these benefits, the production and consumption of milling oats, used for human consumption, has been expanding as a result of increased demand for health products which has created an opportunity to expand oats markets both in Australia and overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cereal rye industry is small but has the capacity to expand its domestic market, particularly in the health food market where more research and promotion is desirable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian production of approximately 20,000 tonnes per annum is concentrated in the mallee regions of Victoria and South Australia. Although production is small, it plays an important role in overall farm management. Cereal rye is one of the few cropping alternatives for the mallee sandhills, not only allowing producers to obtain an economic return from land that may otherwise be left idle but also preventing erosion and stabilising these soils.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The demand for cereal rye in Australia has centred around the consumption of rye-based bread, biscuits and breakfast cereals. The recent upsurge in food and lifestyle awareness has resulted in a major upswing in the interest in, and demand for, health foods. Overall demand for rye has not always been satisfied from domestic production necessitating imports in recent years which peaked at 10,000 tonnes in 1989/90.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research funding for oats and cereal rye has in the past been obtained from a combination of Commonwealth and State Government and industry sources such as the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation (and its predecessor the Australian Special Rural Research Council), CSIRO, State agriculture departments and universities. However, funding under these programs has not been sufficient to allow these industries to address adequately the range of research and development issues confronting them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of joint Commonwealth/ industry research schemes for oats and cereal rye will broaden the research funding base for these industries and assist in enabling them to achieve their full potential, not only on the domestic front but also from an export perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The operative levy rates for barley and triticale will remain unchanged at $0.75 per tonne and $1.00 per tonne respectively. However, with the agreement of the prescribed grower organisations, the Bill provides for these rates to be increased by regulation up to a maximum of $5.00 per tonne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Initially, the operative levy rates for oats and cereal rye will be 0.5 per cent of the value of the grain with provision for these to be increased by regulation up to a maximum of 5 per cent of the value of the grain. The manner in which the sales value of the grain will be ascertained for levy purposes will be set out in regulations, following further consultations with industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of value-based levies for oats and cereal rye at the request of the GCA reflects the Council's policy of relating the amount of levy payable more directly to the return received by the producer. A value-based levy has applied to wheat since 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all coarse grains, operative rates of levies may be increased by regulation only after consideration of any recommendations to the Minister by relevant grower organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levies relating to each of the coarse grains involved will be payable by the producer of that grain and collected in accordance with the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Administrative and organisational arrangements for the research schemes will be the responsibility of the Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC). Amounts equal to the individual levies and the Commonwealth's matching contributions will be paid into separate accounts under the management of the GRDC. The Corporation is required under its enabling legislation to account separately for expenditure of levy revenue derived from each type of grain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additional expenditure resulting from the extension of matching Commonwealth funding to oats and cereal rye will not commence before 1993/94. At the proposed levy rate of 0.5 per cent of the value of the grain, matching Commonwealth contributions for 1993/94 are estimated at approximately $250,000 for oats and $20,000 for cereal rye. The cost to the budget of Commonwealth matching contributions for the existing barley and triticale schemes is estimated at $3.1 million and $90,000 respectively for 1992/93. Similar outlays are expected in 1993/94.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Coarse Grains Levy Bill 1992 is to impose a levy on barley, cereal rye, oats and triticale in Australia to fund research. The purpose of the Coarse Grains Levy (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1992 is to provide for the collection of levies on the barley, triticale, oats and cereal rye industries and to repeal the Barley Research Levy Act 1980 and the Triticale Levy Act 1988. With reference to the Coarse Grains Levy Bill 1992, coarse grains comprise feed wheat, triticale, sorghum, feed oats, feed maize and barley. Together, coarse grains constitute Australia's second most important crop after wheat. Barley, at $708m in 1989-90; oats, at $178m; and sorghum, at $136m, rank among Australia's top income earners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill proposes to incorporate the existing barley and triticale levies imposed by the Barley Research Levy Act 1980 and the Triticale Levy Act 1988 in a single Act and impose new levies on oats and cereal rye. These proposed levy arrangements are being made at the request of the Coarse Grains Council of Australia, on behalf of coarse grain producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is part of the standard rural industry research and development arrangement through the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, that is, the dollar for dollar industry and government arrangement up to a maximum of 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production for the particular industry. It is estimated that the Commonwealth's matching contribution for oats and cereal rye will total $270,000 per annum from 1993-94, and $3.1m for barley and $90,000 for triticale in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the Coarse Grains Levy (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1992, the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991, the principal Act, provides uniform collection procedures for various levies and charges. Prior to the commencement of the principal Act, each primary industry levy and charge comprised two pieces of legislation, an Act imposing the levy and/or charge and an Act collecting the levy or charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the principal effects of the principal Act was to do away with the levy or charge collection Act for each levy of charge imposed. However, Acts which impose a levy or charge are not able to be consolidated in the same way as collection Acts because of section 55 of the Constitution, part of which provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Laws imposing taxation, except laws imposing duties of customs or of excise, shall deal with one subject of taxation only;. . .</PARA>
<PARA>The provisions of the principal Act largely reflect standard Commonwealth levy and charge collection legislation of the past five years, and update many of the collection arrangements for levies and charges imposed by those Acts listed in the schedules to the principal Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to coarse grains and grain research, this legislation signifies further development in the coarse grains and grain industry generally, which can be seen in three stages. The first stage was when wheat, alone of the grains, had a research arrangement with the Government. Over a period, that was seen to be too narrow. The concentration was on wheat when there was a need for research to develop more appropriate strains of other coarse grain varieties to meet market opportunities and also as required for better farm management practices in the wheat-sheep zone of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second stage in the development of research arrangements came with the inclusion of that broader range of grain varieties in the research arrangements. In this second stage, yield, as well as suitable varieties for different climatic and soil situations, was the dominant factor. The third stage is where the yield is still important but market requirements are now having a higher priority than before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition parties will be supporting this legislation. We acknowledge the progress that is being made with coarse grain research and recognise that there is now a need for more special research to pick up these market opportunities. At a time when coarse grain growers of Australia are experiencing their lowest incomes on record&mdash;according to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, it is $32,000 on a farm business basis&mdash;and the uncertainties and unfairness of a corrupt world grain trade, these farmers are really setting an example to the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particularly difficult economic time, these growers are prepared not only to meet the standard or the challenge set for them by government of 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production but also to go beyond it. If other sectors of Australian business were prepared to make the same sacrifices for long term gains for the international competitiveness of their industry, Australia would be looking forward to a far better future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The idea of the Coarse Grain Levy Bill is to bring together in one Bill certain different Acts and to impose a levy on oats. I welcome the measure because there is a wide variety of coarse grains. I have a certain amount of experience in coarse grains, so I had better declare my interest, since I generally forget to do that in these cases. It would be far more organised if we could bring the wheat industry under one roof. I can see that oats, barley, triticale and rye would come in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that in the past the coarse grains have been rather neglected, but not so much on the levy side. We have had a levy on quite a few of them for research, but the money spent on research here, of course, varies with production and production, of course, varies with world markets. Coarse grains, unfortunately, react to what the wheat industry does. If the wheat prices keep up at a certain level, coarse grains go down. So the industry is not able to make any real long term contracts. I know that oats is in fair demand for malting overseas, as well as barley, but getting that reaction caused by the wheat price going up and down really does not let the coarse grains settle down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most stable sort of market is within Australia itself and that is mostly with the stockfeeders. They are making stockfeed and manufacturing stockfeed for animals&mdash;racehorses and that sort of thing. Then, of course, that being a limited market, it gives a limited price. I know oats has been static at $100 a tonne for the last 10 years&mdash;as far as I can remember&mdash;and then for that it has to be delivered to the city as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing about oats is that no really new varieties of high production have been round for quite a time, especially for the low rainfall areas. With the sorts of levies that will be going through, matched by the government contribution, hopefully some new varieties of oats that will produce a reasonably high return in the low rainfalls, as well as the high rainfalls, will be developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Production in high rainfalls is quite high, but where we have that sort of case we want more research to be done on producing grain without producing too much bulk in the straw. Bulk in the straw is very good for those who happen to be growing hay and selling hay as a product, but, unfortunately, with the sorts of varieties that are around there is too much bulk in the straw and by the time it is the right sort of weather to cut hay, it goes rank. So the industry needs an oats to be developed with not too much bulk, enough bulk to cut hay without getting too rank, and, of course, a return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The departments of agriculture, especially of Western<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Australia, have been at the forefront of research into coarse grains, but I believe that it is not repeated around the rest of Australia. By the same token, I would say that some States lead the research into the wheat industry, especially South Australia, where a reasonably high grade quality of wheat has been developed which also has a production. It does not do the economics of a farm much good by producing quality, and quality alone, if there is no production. The formula has to be worked out so that there is a certain amount of return and that is where I believe the South Australian Department of Agriculture and Roseworthy Agricultural College especially have done a good job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting back to the mechanics of the Bill, I think it is a move in the right direction. Going back some time ago, I can remember that there was no levy with oats, but there was a voluntary levy and this is obviously replacing that. It was almost compulsory in the fact that a box had to be marked and I suppose the oats industry got quite a bit of money through levies that they really got by default. Of course, that caused ups and downs in the amount of levy that came through and, coupled with an up and down production, no-one really knew where they were. This Bill, and the Government putting up a dollar for dollar, will make quite a difference to the stability of research which has got to be encouraged in all products, let alone the coarse grain industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If time allows, I will go into a few of the other problems of the rural industry around Australia that exist at the present moment. I have said in this place for quite some time that the rural industry is reviving a certain amount because of the upsurge in wheat prices again, but there are a lot of other aspects that this Government has to look at. In the One Nation package, the Government said that it would in machinery legislation provide certain measures to help out the rural industry. We have not had the legislation, but I think it is too little and, in many cases, too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a certain amount of money for RAS, that is, the rural adjustment scheme. It is called RAFCOR in Western Australia and it is very slow in putting any money out that it may have because it is set up with a bureaucratic sort of system. The money goes to RAFCOR, which then decides how to distribute it and applications are made. These applications are made by farmers needing carry-on finance or finance to build the farm up&mdash;or, indeed, there is a certain amount of finance available to help the ones that have no future get off the farm altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I presume that one can compare that to the pay-out on the Australian waterfront. The only thing is that this Government prefers to help its waterfront mates more than farmers, because its waterfront mates have had security of tenure in their jobs for many years, with guaranteed pay for a maximum of 35 weeks. They still get their pay, whether they work for five weeks or 35 weeks. In Senator Collins's buy-out package, there is an average of $94,000 available to buy out their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Further to that, even though the waterfront reform is going along quite smoothly, as Senator Collins tells us, the Western Australian State Government has bought into the argument by directing its port authorities to take on some of these excess waterfront workers as permanent employees&mdash;permanent employees but still with their same old conditions under that big package, which is a salary of about $50,000 to $60,000 per year, a maximum of 35 hours per week, with no minimum, five weeks holiday pay and all that sort of thing. These regional ports have been forced to take these people on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting back to the Bill again, that sort of arrangement keeps up the costs to get those coarse grains, as well as wheat, across the wharf. What is more, these extras that the port authorities have been told to take on are not needed. What is the use of watching a self-loading ship load or a self-unloading ship unload? It is totally pointless. In that case, if the Government of Western Australia, or indeed any other State government, had any interest for the wheat industry, the coarse grain industry or any other industry, it would not buy into the argument and go down the line of pushing wharfage up rather than down. The figures that I have for the waterfront of Sydney and Melbourne show that costs to put goods across the wharf have gone up 20 per cent in the last 12 months, whereas they should be going down with this waterfront reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side, very little has been done for our grain growers and coarse grain growers. I think that $80m was allocated as extra carry-on finance. I think the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) could instead have looked at the idea of putting that money through the other way by making it available as, say, a one-off GMP, a guaranteed minimum price, for grain. I know that GMP is a dirty word with the Government. The guaranteed minimum price for the wheat industry was taken off by this Government the last time it brought in a new wheat marketing Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I no longer advocate a GMP, but I think a GMP, rather than putting more money into RAFCOR or RAS, would have been a lot more efficient because there would not be that backlog  that there is with RAFCOR dealing with farmers' needs. A one-off guarantee such as the one Premier Carmel Lawrence put on the wheat industry in Western Australia last year, and which incidentally got the crop planted, would enable the money to go back to the local bank managers, who know farmers and businessmen a lot closer to hand, and would be far more efficient. That is where the Government could have helped. The Government could have helped by implementing other measures to take the imposts off farmers, rather than what it has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We got into the tariff debate this morning. The Democrats this morning moved a motion to suspend standing orders to debate tariffs. The only reason they did so, of course, is that this is the last broadcast day in the Senate before the Wills by-election. The rural producers had to cop their tariffs first. It is too late to go back on tariffs; we have to keep going. The Government and the Opposition have the same sort of policy. We have to keep going. The rural producers have taken their hit in the past and it is time that industry took its medicine and became far more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the measures in the Coarse Grain Levy Bill because they will only make for more efficiency in collecting levies in time to come. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very encouraged to see in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> an editorial which goes a long way to answering the question raised by Senator McKiernan. The first sentence of the editorial headed `Aborigines: not just money' reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first task arising out of the Royal Commission into Black Death in Custody is simply to keep more Aborigines out of jail.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that very evident point arose out of the deliberations of that royal commission. The royal commission found that Aboriginal people in custody do not die at a greater rate than non-Aboriginal people in custody. That was perhaps a surprising finding. But the royal commission did find this overwhelming difference: the rate at which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people come into custody is about 29 times that at which the non-Aboriginal population comes into custody. If non-Aboriginal people had been imprisoned at the same rate as Aboriginal people were during the period reviewed by the royal commission, then some 8,500 deaths in custody would have resulted. That gives some idea of the magnitude of the impact on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of their detention in police cells and prisons throughout this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for that reason that we need to take urgent steps to reduce the numbers of those who are detained in such custody situations. Perhaps the real breakthrough in the Government's response in this regard is the funding of the establishment of a series of bail hostels around the country. These bail hostels will be of particular use for young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are often denied bail because they do not have the appropriate fixed address or the means of meeting other conditions relating to bail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact that there is a greater likelihood of custodial sentences being imposed if young people are detained rather than granted bail. So it is very important that these bail hostels be established under the supervision of an Aboriginal person who acts as a house parent or supervisor of the bail hostel. As these hostels are established around the country, I believe that they will provide a very sensible diversion from the sorts of custody and detention which apparently lead to the rate of deaths that have been revealed by the royal commission.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, very much so. The February current account deficit figures released today showed a fall of some $237m to $667m in seasonally adjusted terms. That would imply an annual current account balance well below the Budget forecast of a current account deficit of $14 billion in 1991-92.</PARA></TALK.START>

Imports are down by 0.6 per cent. Exports are up by 9.8 per cent, which gives the lie to the constant suggestion we hear that any improvement in the trade balance is simply a function of the recession causing a reduction in imports; it is coming on the export side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The balance of merchandise trade improved from a surplus of $77m over that period to a surplus of $2.5 billion.

The costings say that the proposals include a reduction in Commonwealth payments to the States to leave the States in a budget neutral position.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, there will actually be no more money available within the public hospital system, but there will be an offset from the private patients, with their bed day charges, only just compensating for the decline in assistance from State governments for the public hospitals, which is forced on them by the cut in funding from the Federal Government to the States as proposed by the Opposition. So there is no way in which public hospitals will be better off or able to provide more services to cater for more patients within the public hospital system. It is completely misleading to suggest that public hospitals will be improving their capacity to serve more patients in the provision of hospital care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the Federal Government believes that the public hospital system is the cornerstone of the Australian hospital system.

Australia Post gave a number of specific answers, which I will get for Senator Bjelke-Petersen, but I think I can explain today the gist of what it said. The magazines to which the honourable senator refers have been loss-makers for Australia Post for a very long time. The losses amount to many millions of dollars; they are very considerable indeed. When we give Australia Post a charter that says, `You shall operate as a commercial organisation; you'll organise yourself on proper business lines', it is very difficult then to say to it, `But where you're making losses, you're not allowed to fix it'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is, of course, that the ordinary users of postal services have been subsidising the rates for these magazines for many years. Whether that cross-subsidy can be justified is, I think, the heart of the problem. As I understand last night's evidence, the average increases are around 30 to 35 per cent, and they were necessary to get this service up to the point, at least, of being commercially viable. I do not believe that the Government ought to sanction the kind of cross-subsidy that makes every person who uses the postal service across Australia subsidise the loss-making parts of the business. So I think really what Australia Post has done is live up to the charter. I do not really think we can ask it to do any more than that.</PARA>

<PARA>I do not hold Senator Evans personally responsible in any way, nor do I hold Senator Button directly responsible. However, in their representative capacities, they both have something to answer for because these questions&mdash;although they are not as egregiously out of date as some more recent ones to which Senator Button has finally provided answers&mdash;are very serious policy questions nonetheless, particularly the one in relation to the superannuation guarantee levy. I understand that the Bill became available this afternoon. That gives these questions an even greater significance than they might otherwise have had, particularly when one has regard to the fact that the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation received from the Treasurer before the Treasurer before last, Mr Kerin, a letter dated 2 October in which he undertook to provide that Committee with a submission from the Treasury. That is more than six months ago. In other words, the Treasury is deliberately treating the Senate Committee with contempt. It is clearly doing its best to frustrate the sensible deliberation and consideration by that Committee of some fundamental issues. That is why these questions are on notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These questions were put on notice on 27 February this year in view of the continuing failure on the part of the Treasury. I want to make it very clear to Senator Evans and those he represents that unless answers are received before Question Time tomorrow, I will be moving to censure the Government in no uncertain terms. It is abundantly clear to anyone who studies these questions that they go to the very heart of the debate about superannuation in this country. In many respects the Government is in the process of setting up a superannuation guarantee levy Bill to legitimise a compulsory scheme. It arises purely because of the comprehensive failure of the award-based system to deliver the goods. When all logic says that it ought to be put forward as a replacement for that failed system, it is simply to be superimposed on top of it, making matters comprehensively worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These questions not only go to the essence of the SGL but they raise even more important matters in terms of the impact on employment and inflation of a proposal which is clearly going to result in employers in many instances having to find up to 12 per cent of wages by way of contributions over the next eight years. That is an impossible task unless it is done at the expense of profits and retained earnings, and consequently the ability to reinvest in plant and equipment, expand businesses and create jobs. On the other hand, it will be at the expense of wage increases. I have no doubt that it will be the latter and that the ACTU is comprehensively hoodwinking its own membership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the members do not realise and what they ought to know by now is that they will be the ones who will pay for the privilege of disqualifying themselves from the age pension. In other words, over the next eight years the workers of Australia are going to be forced to go without wage increases, even keeping level with inflation, in order to disqualify themselves from the age pension. The burden of superannuation in this country is going to rest on the shoulders of those whom the Government claims to represent. This is not only a heartless policy but a very dishonest one. I hope that people&mdash;such as Senator Faulkner&mdash;who probably were not aware of this until now, will rush back to the ACTU and say that it is not on. Unless we know how it will be funded and what the employment and inflation consequences will be, those people are being hoodwinked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is the CAI right or wrong when it says that about 60,000 jobs will be lost over the next decade? Senator McMullan wrote a very interesting article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on all of this; again quite misleading. He had the temerity to suggest that one of the achievements of award superannuation was to extend the spread of superannuation to part time and casual staff. What he did not tell them, of course, was that they are being taken to the cleaners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless one has income well in excess of $3,000, all of the contributions will be eaten up in administration and insurance charges. It is an absolute disgrace. The workers of Australia would not stand for it for a moment if they knew the facts, but they are not being told them. They are simply being told by this Government that it has managed to achieve a spread in coverage. The price of that spread in coverage is that contributing 3 or 5 per cent of a minimum $3,000 will leave workers behind. In theory, they could be owing money to the insurer. That is the price they are paying for this so-called spread in superannuation coverage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Workers have already been forced to go without 3 per cent in wage rises. The ACTU has constantly told us that the first round 3 per cent was at the workers' expense; it was not an impost on employers. There is absolutely no doubt, from reading Senator McMullan's article, that the balance of the 12 per cent is also going to be the workers' shout. So in other words, the workers of Australia are going to go without wage increases over the next decade in order that they can pick up the tab for superannuation in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why this set of questions is fundamentally important. We want to know the real savings impact, for example, of a compulsory system. I have no doubt that Senator Walsh is right in saying that there will simply be a savings switch as a result of the SGL. Individuals will reduce their discretionary savings to compensate for enforced savings through the SGL. Indeed, it is quite clear from the most recent Mintel survey that that is what is happening already. Employers are scaling down their level of voluntary, discretionary contributions and workers are doing the same. They are going to simply settle for a lowest common denominator approach. They will wash their hands of superannuation. They will leave it to the employer, who, of course, is screwing them at their own expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The end result will be that the workers will simply get the bare minimum&mdash;not enough to really do them any good in retirement but sufficient to disqualify them, at least in part, from an age pension&mdash;and this Government will tell them that they have never had it so good. I think it is a travesty and a disgrace. One of the best ways of demonstrating this is to look at the answers that are provided. If the Government does not provide them before Question Time tomorrow, we will know that there is only one inference to be drawn and that is that all of those allegations are true, that the Government has no defence and that it is simply trying to hoodwink the public for a little longer. We are not prepared to cop that. </PARA>

Senator Collins said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that on investigation it was discovered that the problem with the F28 was a faulty radar transponder on board the aircraft, and it had nothing whatever to do with the system itself.</PARA>
<PARA>The point is that it really does not matter whether the transponder on the aircraft is working. The primary radar detects the aircraft and shows it on its screen and plots its track. The air traffic controller asks the pilot to set one of three or four frequencies on the transponder in squawk ident and that gives an indication on the blip, on the radar screen, as to what the particular aircraft is. But whether the frequency is incorrectly set, whether the transponder is working imperfectly, or whether in fact there is no transponder at all is irrelevant to the display of the presence of the aircraft, because that is a function of the primary radar, and it should appear on the screen. </PARA>

The figures in the Australian Bureau of Statistics labour force estimates for February 1992 show that the population between the ages of 15 and 19 is 1,330,000&mdash;1.33 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of people in that age group in the labour force is 774,600; not three in 10&mdash;six in 10. The Minister misled the House, apparently because of incompetence. The number of people in that age group not in the labour force, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, is 556,800. That is four in 10, not the seven in 10 the Minister endeavoured to pretend to this chamber were the real figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has confused the number of people in tertiary and secondary education with the number of people not in the work force. The Minister simply does not understand that a large proportion of those people are at work either full time or part time as well as undergoing some kind of training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister's massive incompetence&mdash;he assures me it is not deliberate&mdash;leads him to have made a grievous error. The facts are simple and clear. Even if we include all those wanting only part time work, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, we get a figure of 27 per cent&mdash;2 1/2 times the total rate for all Australians. Twenty seven per cent of young people cannot even find part time work, let alone full time work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key point that Senator Patterson was making is, of course, totally accurate. That key point is this: the Minister has never ever objected to the expression, `There is a 10 per cent unemployment rate'. Yet the Minister magically objects to Senator Patterson using as an unemployment rate a proportion of the labour force. Yet the 10 per cent unemployment rate the Minister happily accepts all the time&mdash;and apparently too happily because he is doing nothing to fix it up&mdash;is only as a percentage of the labour force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>For his information, if exactly the same criteria that he used to denigrate Senator Patterson&mdash;and used last week to try to denigrate me&mdash;were applied to the total unemployment rate, it would make it 7.2 per cent. I mention that just in case the Minister wants to try to mislead the chamber about that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that, concerning youth unemployment, the Minister has never complained, as indeed he should not, about headlines or anything else that say that the unemployment rate is 10 per cent, because that is the proportion of the labour force. Just as Senator Patterson's calculation of one in two as a proportion of the labour force seeking full time work is totally accurate. If she had extended it to cover those people seeking part time work, the figure would be almost 30 per cent for Australia and no doubt far above that for Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Would the Minister for Industrial Relations explain to the Senate how youth unemployment is so wonderful according to his figures when, over the last two years, 182,900 full time youth jobs have been wiped out? Can he explain to the Senate how youth unemployment is so wonderful when, of the 158,200 total job losses over the last two years&mdash;that includes part time work&mdash;157,700 are youth jobs? They almost make up the total number of jobs lost, and the Minister has the temerity to come into this place and seek to mislead this chamber on the severity of youth unemployment. Why does he not pretend that total unemployment is only 7.2 per cent? Because he knows it to be false; that is why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has double standards. Because he is so embarrassed about the appalling level of youth unemployment, he will stop at nothing to try to deceive the Australian people about the true nature of youth unemployment. He should be embarrassed and ashamed. It is a disgrace that he is using the young people of Australia in this way, with a petty debating point which is false anyway, to try to cover up his failure to do anything to diminish the horrendous level of youth unemployment, which his Prime Minister said in 1984 was such that no government should ever be forgiven for allowing it to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister might say, `Ah, but if you use a particular set of figures you will find that youth unemployment, as defined by you, was worse under the Fraser years than it is now'. If the Minister wants to have a look at the official statistics, he should look at the actual number of unemployed persons. In February 1992, for those aged 15 to 19, the figure was 209,300. In 1983, it was 209,200. As a matter of accuracy, just 100 more people were unemployed as at February 1992. These figures are not seasonally adjusted; these are the actual number of young people aged 15 to 19 out of work, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Is the Minister going to try to pretend that the ABS tells fibs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is worse is that another Australian Bureau of Statistics survey showed that 150,000-odd people attending schools or tertiary institutions said that if jobs were available they wanted them, but that they were not actively seeking them because there were no jobs available. That was a survey last September by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If we add in those 150,000-odd who really want jobs but who are being paid to go back to school under Austudy, what sort of horrendous unemployment figure do we get? The Minister is taking the credit for having sent back to school, by paying them Austudy, those people who could not get jobs but who wanted jobs. He has managed a huge retention rate largely because the young people of Australia cannot get jobs and they may as well go back to school. The Minister is crowing about it. The Minister's deception, his misleading of the Parliament, and his use of young people in this way is a disgrace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems that nastiness is a contagious disease on the Opposition benches&mdash;and no wonder because, when the question was raised with me in Question Time today, it hit a raw nerve in the Opposition. The facts are that this Government has always been uncomfortable with and concerned about the level of unemployment in this country. We are particularly concerned about the long term unemployed and the young unemployed in this country. We do not yield to the synthetic concern of the Opposition on this as being superior. This is genuine commitment and concern from this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what the Government has always tried to do is tell the truth about this&mdash;and we have. We insist that this debate be conducted truthfully, honestly and fairly. That is the reason why, in my answer to the question, I concentrated on simply setting out the facts. If the facts offend and if the facts are uncomfortable, they are uncomfortable for the Government because the level of unemployment is palpably too high. But if the facts offend the Opposition, then it is clear to see why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We only have to turn to the Opposition's consumption tax package to see what the Opposition proposes to do about the level of youth unemployment or unemployment in general in this country. What it proposes to do is abolish the labour market support programs that we have in place to provide training, Jobsearch, subsidies to employers to take on young people, and things of that nature. The Opposition proposes to just wipe all those out&mdash;they will be gone, kiss them goodbye, ta-ta, we will not see them again. That is the Opposition's proposal; that is an indication of its concern and sympathy for the plight of young unemployed!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next part of the proposal in the consumption tax package is the abolition of the CES. The CES will get the chop&mdash;that will be finished; it will not be there any longer. The coalition would put the CES out to private contract. The abolition of the CES will mean that the Youth Access Centre and the Youth Bureau will go. If both of those were retained, it could be said at least fairly that there was some concern for the unemployed in terms of services to help them find employment. But no, under the consumption tax package they will get the chop too. This is from an Opposition that claims worry and concern. Its actions hardly match the rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently the sin I have committed is that I fingered them by saying, `Let's look at the facts', which are these: compare the unemployment figures during the last year of the Fraser Government&mdash;a government in which Mr Howard was the Treasurer and Dr Hewson was the senior economic adviser to the Prime Minister&mdash;with the unemployment figures that I have for February this year, seasonally adjusted as the proper measure. There are now 32,900 people between the ages of 15 and 19 in work compared to then&mdash;and this out of a much larger labour force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That offends the Opposition because it goes essentially to this: sure, we have a recession and sure, we are coming out of it, and the electors of Wills and other electorates in Australia will judge the major parties on who can perform best to lower the level of unemployment for permanent careers&mdash;not artificial jobs&mdash;for young people. That is what they will judge us on. When we compare what the Opposition did with what we are doing in dealing with a very difficult recession&mdash;on that test&mdash;we succeed, the Opposition fails. That offends the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me come back to this question of the youth labour force. This is a matter for vigorous debate. Although we have the somewhat over-blown rhetoric of my colleague Senator Baume&mdash;I will be nice to Senator Baume&mdash;there is a basis for genuine debate on this question. The Opposition proposes to pretend that the youth job market for young people between the ages of 15 and 19, as it is commonly measured, is the same labour market and has the same characteristics as the adult labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the outstanding characteristics of the adult labour market is that many adults tend to be married with children. Therefore, one or other of the partners is not working; they are out of the labour force. So we look at the participation rate and we calculate unemployment based on the participation rate. Between the ages of 15 and 19 it just so happens, according to my observations of human nature, that there are very few people out of the labour force based on the fact that they are married and supporting families. But the Opposition says, as Senator Patterson did in her press release, that the level of youth unemployment is one in two. I quote directly from the headline of her release that she has incorporated: `One in Two Young Victorians Unemployed'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has to be said: when we came to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>government, Australia, because of the levels of retention&mdash;the number of kids in year 12 at high schools&mdash;was an international laughing stock. In the OECD comparison, we spent about the same amount of money on education as did Turkey. That has changed dramatically. We provide better education for young kids to go through to year 12. The retention rate has increased by 80 per cent. There has been a massive commitment to education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The life chances for young kids, including those who are unemployed, are enhanced greatly by better educational standards and better training. We have done that, but we get penalised in this debate because we are successful. We get penalised because we have succeeded in providing better educational standards. Those opposite do not recognise that in terms of the total population of young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">High school training is one thing, university opportunities is another and opportunities for technical training is a third. We have spent 42 per cent more in real dollars, in real expenditure, on opportunities for post-secondary education. There has been an increase of that amount. So there are more places available in universities today than ever before. The program is to expand that.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have proposed in the One Nation statement to spend $720m more on providing for an enhanced role for TAFEs, so that kids leaving school can receive technical education through the TAFE system. That is on top of a huge commitment already through the States and the Commonwealth for TAFE education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have fundamentally changed the composition and nature of the labour market for young people by providing enhanced educational opportunity and ongoing training opportunity. On a rough order of indication&mdash;to simplify the complex terms that are traded across this chamber in debate, and indicate to people who listen to this place what the debate is about&mdash;that means that seven out of every 10 young people in the population of 15- to 19-year olds are in education and being trained and three of them are in the work force. Of the three in the work force, one is unemployed and two are employed. That simply and starkly illustrates in a shorthand way what we are debating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will not account for the seven who are being trained and it will not account for the extra number that are being trained under us. It will not acknowledge that there are fewer people unemployed in this age bracket under us in this recession than there were under its recession when it was in government. It will not acknowledge that people in the labour market get placements for jobs quicker under us than they got under those opposite when they were in government, and quicker than they do in the mainstream adult labour market. It will not acknowledge any of those things. The Opposition wants to dramatise and take comfort, joy and pleasure out of the misery of unemployment by making it a trite political argument. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">North Queenslanders frequently complain&mdash;and with good reason&mdash;that they are residents of a forgotten land. . . forgotten by politicians and governments in Brisbane and Canberra who care not a jot for the contribution the North makes to the nation's wealth, other than to accept it with scant thanks or no thanks at all. However, we should recognise that sometimes we appear so ungracious that it is not surprising we are overlooked. A case in point is the visit being made to our area by 19 Liberal senators, who have split into teams to visit different parts of the North on a fact-finding and familiarisation tour. Surely this is something to be applauded and welcomed. We spend a great deal of time and effort whingeing about being ignored by the residents of Canberra's ivory towers&mdash;yet when they make an effort to come here and be informed they are greeted with cries of "junketing" and wasting taxpayers' money. This was the knee-jerk, political reaction of federal Tourism Minister Alan Griffiths, himself a recent visitor to the North at the taxpayers' expense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hasten to say that the Minister's visit was welcome, too. The Bulletin was entirely in favour of his journey here and the new understanding of the North's problems that he took back with him to Canberra. Nothing but good can come from his visit. Similarly, we expect that nothing but good will come of the senators' northern tour. There is nothing like personal experience to give our legislators a feeling for distant areas and their particular problems. There is, too a lesson in this for all of us, including members of parliament. The findings of the Fitzgerald Commission and subsequent investigations by the Criminal Justice Commission into what can only be described as nit-picking examinations of the misuse of MP's travelling costs has created an atmosphere of fear&mdash;being sent to jail is not a minor punishment&mdash;sufficient to cause most federal and State MPs to think twice or three times before they use their passes for the very reason they were issued: to allow MPs to become familiar with the country they were elected to govern. For this very reason, the 19 Liberal senators should be welcome in the North. They have got off their backsides and come to have a look at us.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the response by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Richardson) to a question by Senator Newman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move this motion because Senator Richardson told the Senate that there will be no porn pay TV in Australia. That is absolutely untrue. He has misled the Senate and attempted to mislead the people of Australia. He has been proven wrong out of his own mouth, because he then said that his proposal would allow R-rated films to be shown on pay TV. That proposal means that not only will porn pay TV be beamed into Australian home environments, but also ultra-violent films which have a `prevailing tone of ruthlessness and savagery' will also be transmitted into the Australian home environment. I use those quotes deliberately because that is how the Film Board of Review referred to some of these films which are now classified as `R' and which the Minister says will be available to be beamed directly into Australian homes via pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Senator Richardson's proposal will, as I have said, enable porn pay TV to be transmitted into the home environment in Australia. This proposal will be very much welcomed by Canberra's hard-core porn merchant who is gearing up for this very enterprise. Mr Lark has indicated that if he cannot get X-rated videos into homes he will get the R-rated equivalents. As the Joint Select Committee on Video Material said in its report, quite a number of R classified films and videos are identical in theme, representation, intent and title to their X counterparts, save only for `explicit' closely detailed depictions of genitalia. In other words, they are precisely the same porn movies taken with a different camera at a different angle. The theme is the same, the content is the same and the intent is the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That clearly indicates that what the Minister said is false. His proposal will allow porn pay TV to show the types of degrading pornographic films that were described in the Joint Select Committee's report. His proposal will allow films, the dominant theme of which is that they objectify and commodify women, to be shown on pay TV. He obviously does not know this. He has not read the Joint Select Committee's report, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather than treating women as free and responsible initiators of human activity, the material in this category, although non-violent, treats women as sexual commodities to arouse the sexual desires of its target audience.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on; I will not quote it further. I refer to chapter 13 of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material. I quote another aspect because Senator Richardson may be reminded at one stage of the message that he sent to a particular union that was concerned about this video material. Paragraph 13.49 of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material says of these videos that we are talking about:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women are often depicted as sexually malleable for the purpose of satisfying male sexual desires. This is sometimes manifested by themes involving workplace sexual favours. Women are frequently depicted as eager for sexual experience of any kind and ever ready for any opportunity for sexual activity. This is frequently manifested in the group sex scenes depicting diverse sexual activity, which are a feature of much of the material in this category.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister has clearly misled the chamber. It is the theme and the content, as much as the explicitness, which mediate the problematic attitudes in regular viewers. The Joint Select Committee heard evidence that this type of material, which he says ought to go into the homes of Australian subscribers, mediates in the minds of the habitual viewer a callous and manipulative orientation towards women and an attitude that women are highly promiscuous and available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go to the question of violent films. The Minister says that R material ought to be beamed directly into our homes through pay TV. I quoted before a description of one of the R classified films that the Film Board of Review described as having `a pervading tone of ruthlessness and savagery'. The Film Board of Review describes another R film as being `an orgy of violence with a grisly procession of blows, kicks, stabbings, shootings and graphic bone breakings and having no mitigating qualities at all'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it was necessary for me to move this motion to take note of the Minister's answer because the record must be set right. Either the Minister is ignorant, or he is deviously attempting to hoodwink and deceive the public. I presume it is the former. My concern is that if it is not, this Minister will be responsible for a dirty three-card trick on the people of Australia. Not only will he and the Government have to answer for that; each individual senator and member of the Government will also have to answer it before the electorate. </PARA>

I am very glad that as a result of pressure by the coalition parties the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Telecommunications Technologies was set up to investigate the standards to be maintained on the new technologies. It has already reported on the 0055 numbers which Telecom introduced and which we deplored.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very glad to welcome the press release put out today on this issue by my colleague the shadow Minister for communications, Mr Warwick Smith. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As yet we have no decision that Pay TV is to proceed, yet already the decision of `porn' or no `porn' is made. This government will be remembered for its debts, its deals and now its approach to `porn'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is our view that there should be restrictions on what can be shown on Pay TV in the interests of community standards and in particular the protection of children and that program standards which currently exist in relation to free-to-air broadcasters should also apply to Pay TV. It is also the policy of the Coalition to proscribe X-rated videos.</PARA>
<PARA>He then draws attention to the Senate Select Committee which we pushed to be established and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Committee in its interim report . . . recommended that Telecom adopt a code of conduct&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is my strong view that similar standards should apply to Pay TV content and that R rated material on Pay TV not be available to PIN holders and I will so argue to the Coalition front bench when this matter is presented for decision.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no getting away from it, my colleague will have my full and whole support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw to the Senate's attention a speech that was made by the Victorian Prosecutor for the Queen, Mr Richard Read, in Tasmania in November last year. Mr Read started his speech about pornography and depicted violence by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are issues which strike right at the heart of every family in Australia. However, I am pleased to say that the tide seems to be turning, as the media and certain politicians are now taking a much closer look at the obvious moral and ethical issues associated with the public display of both violent and pornographic material. It is imperative that responsible women's groups throughout Australia become vocal about these issues and take the lead in turning the tide.</PARA>
<PARA>That is happening. Women's groups, from the Left of politics to the Right of politics, are speaking out about the impact of this burgeoning pornographic tide on women and children. The Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne, in referring to an article which was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current restrictions on the importation, production and screening of such pornography reflect community attitudes which are already quite liberal enough. Whatever is freely and legally available in video tape outlets will be obtained and used by children. It is naive and dishonest to argue otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA>The same goes for the Minister's answer today. He seemed to think that using a PIN and a Smartcard was beyond the wit of the children of Australia&mdash;perhaps he does not know much about the children of Australia. The Archbishop said, and I think this is the crux of the matter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We live in a free society and we rightly treasure its benefits but we also share significant responsibilities for the well being of every citizen. It is not possible, on moral, democratic or logical grounds for a just and equitable society to liberalise laws that increase violence and demean human relations and behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is why I am so concerned at this growth in pornography under the sponsorship of this Government. Mr Read, in his speech, went through some cases which were on his files in the prosecution section of the courts in Victoria. He did a very brief exploratory study. I do not intend to go through all of them by any means. I will refer to two cases. The first case is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At 2.00 a.m. on Thursday 21st March 1991 a young woman age 35 lay asleep in her home in Bundoora, a Melbourne suburb, with her 3 1/2 year old daughter beside her. Her other two children aged 8 and 6 years were also asleep in the home. She recalls waking up to find a strange man on top of her, wearing a mask.</PARA>
<PARA>He taped her mouth, tied her up, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He then removed her nightdress and proceeded to rape her repeatedly, both vaginally and orally and attempted to rape her anally. This included placing her on the kitchen table and attempting to rape her there . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rapist lived only a few streets away and had planned this attack for some time. When arrested at the hospital where he worked the police found a pornographic video amongst his personal belongings. When they searched his home the police found a large collection of X rated videos. He admitted watching two pornographic videos shortly before he left to commit this rape&mdash;"Innocent Seduction" and "What's Love Got to Do with It". He said there was no particular story line in these videos which related to what he did and no bondage, but he agreed with the police that these videos had "triggered" him. The police have shown me</PARA>
<PARA>&mdash;that is, Mr Read&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">both these videos and I can assure you the scenes in "What's Love Got to Do with It" closely match what this rapist did to his victim. The actor in the video has intercourse with the actress on the kitchen table, just as this rapist did with his victim. He said he had been home alone watching pornographic videos.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">". . . . . . I've sat home watching videos&mdash;X rated videos, for a while. Earlier, I had no idea&mdash;I had no intentions of doing anything like this but as I was watching the videos and that, just sorta&mdash;I thought&mdash;thought about it and then it come to mind. I thought. I'll go out n'&mdash;for a walk and see what happens and that's when&mdash;as I was walking I was trying to say, you know, don't do it, don't do it, and that's when&mdash;it just kept you know, coming into my mind to do it because I had everything prepared just in case. I took my gloves and all that".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This offender said he made the balaclava that night while he was watching the X rated videos, and went to a supermarket to buy the stockings and rubber gloves. He told the police he was still a virgin with no girlfriend and was sexually frustrated. He said it was fair to say that he got these fanciful ideas from pornographic videos and books and magazines he had viewed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. . . His Honour Judge Bart sentenced him to 5 years imprisonment with a minimum term of 4 years. In sentencing him Judge Bart said it was:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"all very well for the community to call for condign punishment for an offender who commits sexual offences. The community at the same time appears to encourage and condone, if not promote the making, sale and rental of such videos which clearly can be expected to influence the sexual behaviour of susceptible members of the community.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hesitate to call it hypocrisy but it surely points to a lack of consistency in the social and moral standards which underpin our laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His Honour went on to say that because of the:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">". . . ..unrestricted rights of so called adults to watch X-rated videos, the community would have to tolerate the terrible effects. "It is a matter for communities and parliaments, not for me".</PARA>
<PARA>The second case is very short, but also appalling. The facts are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the 23rd January 1990 a young 19 year old girl was taken against her will to a motel in Seaford a bayside suburb outside Melbourne. The offender was aged 25 and married with three young children. He forced her to undress and then placed his penis in her mouth and ejaculated in her mouth. He then had vaginal intercourse with her and this caused her great pain. This rapist proceeded to have intercourse with her in various positions, including anal intercourse. He then put her under the shower and got in with her and attempted intercourse under the shower. Still not satisfied he had vaginal intercourse again after the shower. He then masturbated and ejaculated on her face and finally left her.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following his arrest he was interviewed by police and told them how his fantasy turned into an obsession. This interview was recorded on video tape and I &mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Mr Read&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">refer to the transcript:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q"Well, now that you've brought up the fantasy, are you able to tell me how your fantasy developed?</PARA>

Yet, somehow, there seems to be a failure to connect the influence on people's behaviour of watching pornographic material, and them involving themselves in the fantasies and obsessions which I have just described, which have led to such serious and terrible crimes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Richard Read, the Prosecutor for Victoria, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the onus of proving that there is not a significant link between pornography and imitative criminal behaviour, and depictive violence and imitative criminal behaviour, lies squarely with those who assert, contrary to human experience, that there is no such causal link.</PARA>
<PARA>I conclude by saying that we are desperately concerned at the danger to women and children and the apparent readiness of the Government to allow the expansion of pornography, as it has already done with the 0055 telephone numbers and as it appears Senator Richardson is prepared to condone or encourage with pay television. My question to him at Question Time related to the rights of some people in this society to take priority over the rights of the vulnerable; namely, women and children. The Minister must not go unchallenged on this. All decent men and women in this country must strongly make their objections heard. This has to be stopped. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, apart from the Minister's answer at Question Time, we really have no idea whether he wants violent and sexually violent videos in our homes, with the supposed precaution that adults have a PIN.

It is making some exceptions, of course. It cannot allow South Australia to do without tobacco industry sponsorship of its car race. However, the Government is supposedly so concerned about tobacco advertising and the scenes depicted by the tobacco industry on television that it will ban it. Yet when it comes to pornography and violence there is no government concern about influence there at all. That is illogical. It is hypocritical, and I am appalled by Senator Tate's acceptance of the rubbish that will be put into homes by his Government. </PARA>

As I indicated&mdash;and I have just tried to get the figure&mdash;there are hundreds of `R' classified videos which are the equivalent of X-rated videos. These R-rated videos have the same title, the same theme, the same intent and the same content as the X-rated material, which includes hard-core pornography, except that the scenes are taken by another camera from a different angle, or milliseconds of tape are excised.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is appropriate that the Senate focus today on the subject of Cambodia, and on the prospects for a lasting peace in that long-suffering country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Great crimes have been committed against the Cambodian people. The tragedy of the conflict has been brought home to us all through the personal witness of many Cambodian Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 28 February, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution formally creating the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia or UNTAC, the body responsible for implementation of the historic Comprehensive Political Settlement of the Cambodia Conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to the UN Secretary General's request for contributions to UNTAC's operations, Australia has agreed to provide 495 Defence Force personnel to form the Force Communications Unit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This total includes 65 communicators already deployed as part of the UN Advance Mission in Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If conditions are right in Cambodia, the Government expects that the main Australian contingent will begin deploying during this month.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They will be joined in the field by 40 signallers from the New Zealand Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, Australia has provided UNTAC's military commander, Lieutenant-General John Sanderson, who commenced duty in Cambodia on 15 March. Australia will contribute six staff to his headquarters unit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government also expects to contribute to UNTAC's civilian component, whose composition is still under consideration by the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of this, we have decided to provide ten police officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, Mr Michael Maley, an officer of the Australian Electoral Commission, has taken up duty in Phnom Penh as Deputy Electoral Commissioner for UNTAC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The creation of UNTAC is the culmination of years of complex and difficult negotiation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The peace plan embodied in the remarkable agreements signed in Paris on 23 October 1991 provides a way of ending the nightmare of Cambodia's recent past.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main objectives of the settlement are to end the civil war, and to allow the Cambodian people to choose a new government through genuinely free and fair elections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reflecting the complexity of the Cambodian conflict, the Paris agreements provide for an unprecedented and ambitious role for the United Nations in the implementation of the peace plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">UNTAC will have a peacekeeping role supervising, monitoring and verifying the cease-fire, partial demobilisation of armed forces, and the cessation of external military assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">UNTAC most definitely will not have a role enforcing or imposing the peace if hostilities break out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the civilian sphere, not only will UNTAC have a role in organising and conducting the elections, it will also play a role in monitoring and supervising the interim administration of the country to ensure a neutral political environment for the elections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the United Nations will be responsible for coordinating and assisting the repatriation and resettlement of some hundreds of thousands of Cambodian refugees and displaced persons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Cambodia peace settlement is a striking demonstration of the fundamental changes that have occurred in the international system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unprecedented cooperation between the Permanent Five members of the Security Council has greatly enhanced the scope for resolving regional conflicts. The UN system has been able to harness broad-based support for its peacekeeping role.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The subtle and dynamic balance of interests in the Cambodia peace agreements reflects the close involvement and cooperation of the Permanent Five members of the Security Council in the negotiating process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The efforts of the Indonesian and French governments deserve special mention. Their initiative, courage and persistence were essential to the success of the peace plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Great credit must also go, of course, to the Cambodians themselves. Those of us who have not known their suffering, or seen the evil they have seen, can only wonder what human qualities it takes to sit down and talk about the future, about peace, and about national reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia played a significant role in the long process leading up to the Paris agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the mid 1980s, former Foreign Minister Hayden was active in regional diplomacy which sought to identify a basis for dialogue between the parties to the Cambodian conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In late 1989, Senator Evans played a key role in breaking the impasse following the first Paris Conference on Cambodia in July and August 1989. The core of Senator Evans's proposal, which was taken up by the Permanent Five members of the Security Council, was an enhanced role for the United Nations in the transitional period preceding elections in Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Evans's resourceful and energetic pursuit of peace in Cambodia has earned him  nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize. It has also earned international respect for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In moving this resolution today I pay regard to the achievement of Senator Evans and his Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In light of our diplomatic contribution, it was appropriate that Australia was the first country to establish accreditation to the Supreme National Council, the interim body in which Cambodian sovereignty has been vested during the transitional period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia was also among the first to supply troops to carry out the vital task of establishing communications and infrastructure in preparation for the deployment of the main UNTAC force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is appropriate that we now help to see the process through.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The return of Australian soldiers to Indo-China in the cause of peace is a matter for us to reflect on with justifiable pride.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With peace secured in Cambodia, we shall be able to welcome the countries of Indo-China back into the mainstream of regional activity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We can confidently expect them to become part of the dynamism of Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Vietnam will now be able to emerge from its isolation and, with Cambodia, play its part in regional and international affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In parallel with the improved prospects for peace in Cambodia, Australia will resume direct bilateral aid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Trade and Overseas Development announced today that, over the next four years, Australia will provide approximately 49 million Australian dollars in development assistance to Cambodia. This total includes 23 million dollars for new bilateral aid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, during this financial year, we are providing approximately 7.7 million Australian dollars in disaster relief and assistance to displaced Cambodians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aspects of the comprehensive settlement have been criticised by some observers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is suggested that it would somehow have been better to exclude the Khmer Rouge from the peace process because of their responsibility for the atrocities committed by the former Pol Pot regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Involvement of the Khmer Rouge in the process does not reflect a judgment by the Australian or other governments that the Khmer Rouge can now be trusted. Rather, it reflects a realistic assessment that the only available effective way of containing the military threat they pose, and of ending the civil war, was to involve them and their main backers&mdash;China&mdash;as parties to the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Put simply, a peace settlement without the Khmer Rouge and China would not be a peace settlement at all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has also been suggested that the settlement could have been improved by providing for 100 per cent rather than for at least 70 per cent demobilisation of the armed forces of the Cambodian parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously such a provision would have been preferable, but the outcome set out in the Paris agreements is the best that could be negotiated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the judgment of the United States, Russia, China, France, Britain, all significant Asian states and Australia that the Paris settlement represents the best available, realistic basis for a just and durable peace in Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">UNTAC will be the costliest, as well as the most comprehensive peacekeeping operation yet undertaken by the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is expected to involve approximately 15,900 military personnel, 3,600 civilian police and 3,300 civilian administrators. More than 50 countries have been requested to contribute to this complex undertaking.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The initial UN estimate of the cost for a duration of 18 months is 1.9 billion US dollars. Australia's share of assessed contributions for this amount is 1.51 per cent or 28.7 million US dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should also advise the Senate that Cabinet agreed in October 1991 to provide supplementation to the Defence Budget of 49 million Australian dollars to fund the estimated costs involved in making our contribution to UNTAC and the United Nations Advance Mission in Cambodia. This is separate from our assessed contribution to UNTAC's budget, described above. We expect this will eventually be partially offset by reimbursements from the UN of some 19.7 million Australian dollars, but this will take some time to materialise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final UNTAC plan and budget are now being scrutinised in New York by representatives of major donors including Australia. It will be some weeks before the final budget is approved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Along with other donors, Australia hopes that, as implementation of the settlement proceeds, an increasing habit of cooperation among the Cambodian parties will allow savings in UNTAC personnel and costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Generally speaking, the settlement is working.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the five months since it was signed, the remarkable thing has been not the number of violations or the number of disputes, but the way in which the Paris agreements have held firm, and the way in which the parties have repeatedly reaffirmed their commitment to the settlement in all its detail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, there have been incidents which threaten the whole process, and the Government has viewed with particular concern the recent fighting in Kompong Thom province. But we must look beyond these hurdles without in any sense trivialising them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Implementation of the peace plan may well prove more difficult than its negotiation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are bound to be further setbacks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We should expect them and not be disheartened when they occur.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's decision to commit Australian forces to the Cambodian peacekeeping operation was not taken lightly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The UN forces will face risks from mines, from disease, from banditry, and possibly from fresh outbreaks of fighting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has assessed these risks and has weighed them carefully. It does not underestimate them, or the need to take every prudent precaution to protect our troops.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have made this commitment, however, because the opportunity to help restore peace to Cambodia is one which the international community cannot lightly let go.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The UN commitment to help Cambodia also serves Australia's direct interests, and those of our neighbours, by helping to create a more peaceful and prosperous region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But it is important to emphasise again that Australian forces will not be participating in the UN operation in order to enforce or impose the peace in Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is a task beyond the UN mandate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather, the Australian forces will be in Cambodia to help keep a peace on which the Cambodian parties themselves have agreed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to respond to the motion that has been moved to take note of the statement and, in particular, the terms of the motion that have been put by the Government before the chamber this afternoon. This, obviously, is an important debate on a most serious matter&mdash;that of not only the Government's assessment of the situation in Cambodia, but also its decision to increase Australian forces in Cambodia to a number of about 500. We are pleased that the Government has finally brought a statement to the Parliament on this issue. This is something that we have been seeking of the Government for some five months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As much as anybody, we want to see peace for the Cambodian people. They have suffered enormously under the Khmer Rouge policy of genocide. I remind you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that during that horrible period more than a million Cambodians were killed; or in other terms, over a quarter of the total population. Since then they have continued to suffer during the civil war. Some 350,000 have been driven out of their homes and their country and now live in the camps along the Thai border. According to the UNHCR, at least another 150,000 can be fairly described as internal refugees who have been forced to leave their homes and are temporarily living elsewhere within Cambodia. These people have lived for too long in misery and in an environment of terror. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In government and in opposition we have constantly looked for ways to support the Cambodian people. We have supported the UNBRO, the border relief organisation of the UN, and the work it has done on the border in the camps. We have helped in all possible ways to support the Cambodian people through support for the Red Cross, UNHCR and NGOs. We have also sought to try to find ways to help them find a peace. Obviously, our preferred solution was to support the two non-communist Khmer factions. That was because we believe that the Cambodians not only deserve peace, but also freedom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In more recent years we saw more potential as the Hun Sen regime at least somewhat liberalised and clearly offered a preferable alternative to the Khmer Rouge. It was offering at least some order and stability, notwithstanding its communist ideology. We looked at the possibility of its perhaps joining with the two non-communist Khmer factions in some peaceful solution. We always had difficulties with any settlement proposals that would again inflict the Khmer Rouge upon the Cambodian people. As the Senate would be aware, we advocated that the international community prosecute Pol Pot and the other leaders of that genocidal regime for genocide in the International Court of Justice. For some years we invited the Australian Government to take a leadership role in that project, which invitation was not taken up. We saw advantage in excluding the Khmer Rouge, giving it no international legitimacy at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise the difficulties inherent in our preferred solution, namely, the strength of the Khmer Rouge military within Cambodia, the determination of its principal backer, China, that it not be deserted and, when it came to the crunch on several occasions, the unwillingness of the Sihanouk faction to isolate the Khmer Rouge, thus end the resistance coalition and potentially become the target of a more powerful adversary. But the down side of the alternative, any quadripartite solution&mdash;a solution that incorporated the Khmer Rouge&mdash;was to embrace that horrible regime and to accept its good faith. It is not surprising that the Hun Sen Government in Phnom Penh would not accept that solution either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus over a period of some time, the international community sought to develop an option. We give credit to Senator Evans and the Australian Government for providing  commitment and effort in seeking a solution other than simply a quadripartite solution that would not be accepted. That alternative option, or the development of the quadripartite option, was to provide and enhance the United Nations role, which would give some support to the Khmer factions if they were in fact able to reach peace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hun Sen was to have some security guarantee in the form of a large United Nations peacekeeping force. The Khmer Rouge was given a benefit under this scheme. It would have the guarantee of not sacrificing its military advantage in a peace. That would be given by the United Nations assuming principal functions or at least supervisory functions of the Cambodian Government, and would be given a place within the Supreme National Council to be established in the run-up to free and fair elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Khmer Rouge was dealt with by the international community with Australia playing a lead role. I regret to say that we saw the unedifying spectacle of the former Khmer Rouge Interior Minister, who ran the torture chambers in the country, receiving international endorsement and a seat on the SNC. It is no wonder that we found that an unappealing prospect. We have seen develop a settlement proposal that, despite a United Nations presence, really requires the goodwill of the Khmer Rouge to succeed. On that basis it is no wonder that we have remained sceptical. Nevertheless we have acknowledged that it could work. The Khmer factions signed on the bottom line. The international community said it would support it. Obviously, despite our reservations, we said, in principle, that we would support it also because, as I said at the outset, the Cambodians deserve every chance at peace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans often quotes me, saying that I did not believe the comprehensive settlement would work. That was a comment I made in Cambodia some 18 months or so ago when I was doing my bit to seek to persuade the Hun Sen Government in Phnom Penh to join with the two non-communist factions in free and fair elections that would thus exclude the Khmer Rouge. What I argued, of course, was that if Hun Sen was prepared to show that initiative, which regrettably in the end he was not, he would engage and attract enormous international support. But it did not go in that direction, as I said, because although he spoke of holding an election, he was not prepared at that time to hold a democratic election. What I said then still remains, to the extent that a comprehensive settlement is not just a signed document and evidence of international support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A comprehensive settlement is a peace and stability in which Cambodians can fairly determine their destiny. That has yet to be achieved. The issue, then, is whether the path that has been chosen, which Australia is supporting by sending military forces, will achieve that objective. Look at that for a moment. We see continued fighting on the ground, principally by the Khmer Rouge, fighting that has been described in recent weeks as the most intense in the past year. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We see a campaign of terror being conducted by the Khmer Rouge using its traditional methodology, in this instance, of firing artillery rounds indiscriminately into villages. We see the Khmer Rouge intimidating refugees on the border, refugees which the UN, with our support, is seeking to relocate back into Cambodia. We see a settlement that has not excluded Pol Pot and his deputies from continuing their power and control over the Khmer Rouge forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we say that, Senator Evans simply accuses us of carping. To work, the UN plan must be realistic. Apart from our concern that the Khmer Rouge is not participating and will not genuinely participate in the peace process, the timetable for repatriation of refugees is simply impossible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wet comes in about two months and lasts until about October. Three hundred and fifty thousand refugees were to be resettled before the end of the year. This week the United Nations is moving the first 600 refugees. It is supposed to increase to 10,000 a week, which is obviously impossible. That impossibility is already being acknowledged by this somewhat quaint notion of moving the refugees from the camps in Thailand to new camps just across the border in Cambodia where they will be able to vote in the election that is planned as part of the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, the process of cantonment and disarming in this environment is highly doubtful. We will be amazed if the Khmer Rouge, in practice, lays down 70 per cent of its arms and disbands 70 per cent of its forces. Even Senator Evans last night acknowledged that it has at least two to three years of arms hidden away. It has wealth from the gem mines,  and the region, as we know, is sadly already flooded with weapons. But even under the Paris Agreement it is still not a complete disarming. Although Senator Evans criticised us for arguing the other day that there should be an effort to increase the disarming to a full 100 per cent, subsequent to his statement the Security Council has included it within its resolution as the desired option&mdash;or, more than desired; something that should be aimed at. That is not surprising. Even under this scheme, if 30 per cent of the 200,000 regular forces still in Cambodia and the 250,000 irregular forces maintain their arms and their combat readiness, they create a most uncomfortable environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, we see little prospect of Hun Sen, particularly that he has now reached a more comfortable relationship with Prince Sihanouk, passing to the UN the supervisory functions of government; that is, the five key portfolios of foreign affairs, defence, communications, interior and one other, which is the plan that we are seeking to put into effect. It is interesting that not so many months ago, when Hun Sen was in this country, he said to us in response to questions that he had no intention of passing over those functions or giving up those functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in this environment is it a reality to see a free and fair election next May? We doubt that it is so. We are concerned also that, despite the rhetoric of the international community, there has been very little forthcoming. The process of establishing UNTAC has been incredibly slow. Australia and some others, notably France and Indonesia, have kept the process going by developing the notion of a phased deployment, hopefully locking in the international community. But from what we learnt last night, only $35m of the initial $200m has been committed. So $35m of the total estimated cost of $1.9 billion has been committed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 40-odd countries that have made a commitment for an initial force, we understand from Senator Evans last night that it is a force of only 4,000. But the Indonesians have provided an infantry battalion of about 800, the Malaysians a similar number and, under this statement, Australia will be providing 500. Adding those together, Madam Acting Deputy President, you will realise that the others will not be providing many at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That initial 4,000 is out of the projected force, the documented intended force, of some 15,000. Bearing in mind that this was to be an 18-month project due to end about the middle of next year, we do not see in these figures great determination on the part of the international community. Australia is clearly a driving force in this commitment. We commend the leadership aspect that Australia has been prepared to show, but the question is whether the process is realistic. We are still concerned about the lack of information that is put before us even in relation to the Australian force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that we will be sending 500 military communicators, but we are not told specifically what they will do. Last night, Senator Evans said that they would build some form of Cambodian Telecom. We should have been told, I would suggest, in this statement exactly what will be their functions and where they will be deployed. Presumably, they will be attached to the infantry&mdash;in the first instance to the Malaysian and Indonesian battalions&mdash;but we were not told that. As I said last night, it seems strange to me to have some 500 communicators for 1,600 troops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told in this statement for the first time that we will be sending 10 police officers, but we are not told what their functions will be. We are not told what countries have committed forces and the nature of the forces that they have committed. We are not told specifically for how long the Australians will be deployed. If we are right, and the UN time assessments are unrealistic, it is likely that Australian forces will be locked in for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are given in this statement no frank assessment on the issue of the ongoing fighting and conditions on the ground. That, we would have thought, would be the bare minimum that we could reasonably expect in this statement and that the Australian people could expect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week, Senator Evans was dismissing the fighting that is occurring as simply skirmishes by war lords, but that does not seem to be the word that is coming out of Cambodia. Yet this statement says, for the first time, that the Australian deployment will be only if conditions are right. Does that imply that conditions are not right at present? Is Senator Evans saying that this situation of skirmishing war lords who happen to be using heavy artillery and firing indiscriminately into villages and destroying bridges and roads, are conditions when it is not right to send the force? We do not understand why this was not explicitly dealt with in this statement that is before us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are given no details as to how the UN proposes to assume supervision of the functions of government in Cambodia that I mentioned a few moments ago. There is no analysis of the effect upon the process of the breakdown of the SNC procedure. I understand that the SNC in its full composition has only been able to meet once. I think it has tried to meet on six occasions but it has not been able to completely meet for various reasons. Yet this was a critical component of the total package. What is the effect of that breakdown upon the package and the peace process as a whole?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are given no details of what role, if any, Australia will play in the demobilisation process. We are disappointed that there is no support in this document for the UN Security Council proposition of 100 per cent demobilisation, which I mentioned also a few moments ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, the statement does not tell the Australian people much at all about this major commitment. It is a major commitment not only in terms of the forces that we are sending and the leadership role that we are assuming but also in terms of the cost. We are told of $49m which will be required from the Defence vote and about $35m in Australian dollar terms which will be our compulsory contribution to UNTAC; $7.7m in disaster relief and the increased aid vote. So a very large sum of Australian taxpayers' dollars is being committed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say in passing that we certainly offer our support to the bilateral aid vote. I want to take this opportunity to commend the incredible work that the NGOs have done in Cambodia over the last 10 years or so when a bilateral program was not in place. I have had the opportunity to visit them and learn from them first-hand of their work. They clearly deserve our commendation and gratitude. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Evans reads the paper, he will see that we have said that we will give priority to our region in aid, which is more than the Government is prepared to do. The Australian Government has not kept the public adequately informed as to the major commitment it is making. It should have put down a statement in this Parliament at the time it assigned the first 50-odd communicators to Cambodia. As I said at the outset, we have had to wait some five months for this promised statement and we still do not have as much detail as is desirable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has sought to take us for granted and expected a blanket endorsement in the same way that it has taken the wider Australian community for granted. We hope that it will now keep the Parliament better informed and we believe that we have a right to expect that. In the event of any significant changes in the size of our force, in the cost, the mission goals, security assessments, timetable or other important details, we expect, and I believe reasonably expect, the Government to inform the Parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are pleased to support this motion endorsing Australia's contribution to the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia. Our endorsement comes without qualification, despite our full recognition that there are dangers which will be encountered by Australian personnel in Cambodia and that the successful completion by UNTAC of its mission cannot be guaranteed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an unusual occasion. We have several differences with the Government and the Opposition on matters of foreign policy&mdash;the Gulf War and self-determination for East Timor spring to mind&mdash;but this is not one of them. The Government's policy on Cambodia is one which we have come to fully support, notwithstanding some earlier reservations about the inclusion of the Khmer Rouge in the peace process. It is clear to us that the peace process, while necessarily an imperfect creature of compromise, gives real hope that the protracted and unparalleled suffering of the Cambodian people can be brought to an end in the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, until today's support for this motion by the Opposition, which we congratulate it on, the Democrats have been disappointed by the stance taken by the Opposition. This is not to suggest that the concerns raised by Senator Hill are not valid, but rather that undue weight has been given to them. The unfortunate tone in which they have been raised created the strong impression that the Opposition had little enthusiasm for the United Nation's unprecedented efforts to achieve peace in Cambodia. There was a striking contrast between the Opposition's reluctant attitude towards this operation and its wholehearted enthusiasm for the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats regard the UN's work in Cambodia as a very large step towards a just and peaceful new world order. However, it must be said that it is a step which has been taken many years later than it should have been. The lack of interest by the world in general to mediate a just peace in Indo-China from the 1950s until the 1980s has seen that region torn apart by the Vietnam war, the resultant destabilisation of Cambodia and the rise to power of the Khmer Rouge, led by Pol Pot, in 1975. Throughout the reign of that despicable tyrant, the UN and the world continued to take no action, although Vietnam was punished when, in 1979, it invaded Cambodia and ended the four years of terror which left one million people dead, perhaps more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be wrong to suggest that Vietnam's invasion was driven by an altruistic commitment to human rights; it most certainly was not. But the fact remains that it brought to a halt a campaign of genocide which matched any of the blackest periods in world history in its horror and brutality. It is to the eternal shame of the wider international community that we all failed to help the Cambodian people when their plight became clear. Finally, in 1992, we are seeing belated but, this time, concerted action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth recalling that past members of the Australian Parliament readily supported the Vietnam war, during which the United States bombed Cambodia, precipitating instability and a power vacuum which was filled by Pol Pot. I expect all Australians to feel some sense of historical moral responsibility to help right the wrongs done to the Cambodian people. Indeed, it is profoundly ironic that not much more than a year ago most members of this Parliament were straining at the leash to send Australian troops to the Gulf war. Surely the Cambodian situation vitally engages Australia's interests at least as much as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Peace in Cambodia and an end to Vietnam's isolation hold the promise of democracy, improved human rights and economic development in a large part of our own region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the Government and the Opposition justified Australia's support for the Gulf war on the grounds that support for a strong United Nations was in our international interests; it is, but the Gulf war was not a UN controlled operation, while this Cambodian peace process actually is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work of UNTAC is a real contribution to a new world order. It is an attempt to achieve justice and peace without the force of arms. It aims to protect the human rights of all affected parties, not just a select group. It seeks to establish a functioning system of democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can all take great pride in the important role which Australians will play in the work of UNTAC. The 65 communicators now in Cambodia and the 430 defence personnel, 10 police officers and other civilians who will follow are to be congratulated for their vital contribution to an important step forward in the conduct of world affairs. In particular, we congratulate Lieutenant-General Sanderson on his appointment as UNTAC military commander, and Mr Michael Maley as UNTAC's deputy electoral commissioner. We offer our best wishes to them and to their families, for we all know that the families suffer just as much as those who are out in the field in these situations. We strongly endorse the part of this motion which looks forward to their safe return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already said, while the Democrats regard UNTAC as having a good chance of succeeding, we are not blind to the dangers and the possibility of failure, and we never have been. This is due in no small measure to the realistic and rational assessments that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has made of the merits and the prospects of the peace process. This was evidenced by the testimony of the then Deputy Secretary of that Department, Mr Michael Costello, to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in February last year. I quote Mr Costello's reply to two of my questions. His first answer was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Anyone who puts his hand over his heart and says, `I trust Pol Pot' is probably not being all that wise. The question you have to ask is not whether you can trust these people . . . but whether the mechanisms, the institutions, the structures, are such as to give you a reasonable prospect that they will be implemented . . .</PARA>
<PARA>His second answer was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People ask, `Can you guarantee . . . there will not be an outbreak of fighting?'. The answer is, `Of course I can't'. What I can say is that I am absolutely certain that fighting will continue if nothing is done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is precisely such a renewed outbreak of fighting which has led to the Opposition's recent doubts about this peace process. However, we believe that it is too early to predict that the fighting will continue and escalate in a way that puts the process in serious doubt. There is every chance that UNTAC can mediate a reimposition of this cease-fire. We will have to wait and see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats note and endorse the categorical assurance of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that Australian personnel are being deployed in Cambodia to keep the peace and not to enforce it. We also note his statement that Australian and other UN forces would have to be withdrawn if the peace process collapses. That would be a great tragedy for the Cambodian people and I am sure that we all hope it does not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) and officers of his Department deserve much credit for the internationally recognised role they have played in developing the only viable solution to the Cambodian conflict. The Australian members of UNTAC can feel justly proud of their involvement in Cambodia. As Australians, we can be proud of this continuation of Australia's long and honourable record in United Nations peacekeeping.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Government, I welcome very much the support for this motion that is now apparent from all corners of the Senate. I also welcome the generally much more moderate, balanced and constructive tone of the Opposition's contribution to this debate compared with some of the more insensitive and, arguably, opportunistic statements of recent days.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, it is clear that there is a very strong understanding in the Australian community of the virtues of the settlement that has been reached, of the stakes that are involved in its carrying through to fruition and of the utility and, indeed, necessity of Australia's involvement. I am glad that the Opposition has now come quite explicitly to appreciate all that and to make clear its support for this involvement and for the particular motion before the Parliament today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the biggest peacekeeping task that the United Nations has ever attempted. It is obvious in that context, given continuing uncertainties in a number of respects on the ground in Cambodia, that there should be a number of loose ends in the way in which the UNTAC operation has so far been described and in the way in which it will proceed. However, I do not think there are as many as have been suggested by the Opposition in this respect. But may I say quickly that the Government is perfectly happy to consult with the Opposition and to share with it the information as it becomes available. Certainly I will do what I can now in this reply to respond to some of the specific questions that have been asked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been difficulties in bringing on a full scale parliamentary debate on this subject before this time simply because of the time it has taken in New York to get the operational plan prepared and at a sufficiently clear-cut stage of implementation in terms of identifying the tasks to be performed, who is being asked to do them and Australia's role in that respect. It has taken some time for all that to occur to the point at which we could make meaningful decisions and have a meaningful discussion. But there is quite a bit that we can now say. It has already been said in the statement, and I will do my best to supplement that in some respects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the concerns that have been expressed, I will begin with the theme, repeated again today by Senator Hill, of the role of the Khmer Rouge in this settlement. I am as conscious as anyone in the world of the appalling record of the Khmer Rouge. I am certainly not a naive advocate of the view that it has now become converted to the democratic process intellectually, emotionally or in any other way. However, I have been of the view for quite a considerable time that no settlement would ever be possible of the appallingly protracted, disastrous situation in Cambodia unless it involved in some credible way all parties active on the ground in Cambodia, and did not seek to exclude one altogether from that process, whatever the obvious attractions in doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The justification for that, as I have explained on innumerable occasions, is our belief that to crudely try to exclude the Khmer Rouge or anybody else from the process would not have made possible a commitment to that settlement process by the relevant external powers whose support, more than anything else, was keeping the conflict going. More specifically, it would not have been possible to include China in the settlement process without a role being found in the way that the settlement process now sets it out for all the parties on the ground; not a role in the actual executive administration of the country&mdash;that was impossible to accept&mdash;but a role as potential participants in the future of that country through the ballot box. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Khmer Rouge have not, in our judgment, necessarily changed their spots at all. We can make no judgment about that and certainly I have no optimism, as I have said, on that score. What we can make a judgment about is that they have been effectively denied a continuation of external arms support and they very clearly have been denied any kind of external political support. As was said by Mr Costello in the passage quoted by Senator Bourne, what the settlement has been all about is creating the structures, the institutions, and the processes to give us the best possible chance that that settlement would be enabled to be put into place, even with the at best very grudging cooperation of one of the key internal players. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have been wrong in our assessment that the Khmer Rouge was capable of being contained in this way and that the settlement was only capable of being achieved by the kinds of approach I have described, then we have not been alone in that misjudgment. It has been an error also perpetrated, adopted and endorsed by all members of the Permanent Five of the Security Council, the Security Council itself, the UN General Assembly as a whole, and certainly all the key neighbouring Asian nations, from Vietnam and Thailand to the other ASEANs to Japan. Every one of those countries has come to accept over the course of the last few years that this kind of settlement strategy, the one on which we are now embarked, was the only game in town. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one doubts, even in the context of that settlement and with all the institutional processes that are being put into place, that the Khmer Rouge will lack the capacity for mischief in the future. They will retain that capacity and, depending on the degree of success of the demobilisation exercise and the location and destruction of arms caches exercises, there may be some considerable residual capacity for mischief. But our judgment&mdash;again, I believe, a judgment shared by all the other countries that have participated in this process&mdash;is that that capacity for mischief is eminently containable and certainly, again, that there is no alternative but to go down the course that has been mapped out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been made in recent days as a demonstration of that kind of mischief that the Khmer Rouge can perpetrate of the situation around Kompong Thom, where fighting has taken place of a kind which has given rise to quite a degree of concern. However, let me say this about that situation in Kompong Thom which has attracted so much media attention and political discussion. At most, the fighting involved was sporadic and low level in character. Much more importantly, despite the concern that has been expressed about its continuation, all the available evidence is that that situation has now been brought back under control; that the military situation there has stabilised. Lieutenant-General Sanderson made it reasonably clear that that was his expectation in an interview he did 24 or 48 hours ago that was widely reported here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am now able to advise the Senate on the basis of the latest information to hand this morning that it has been reported at the level of Mr Akashi, the Secretary-General's representative, and Lieutenant-General Sanderson, who have just given a briefing to the P5 countries and others, including ourselves, in Phnom Penh, that they have been encouraging developments that should assuage the concern of the past few days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, 2DK&mdash;in other words, the Khmer Rouge  liaison officers&mdash;have been taken by UN helicopter to Kompong Thom. A meeting of factional liaison officers and members of the mixed military working group has been held. On yesterday morning, 31 March, CPAF&mdash;that is, the SOC Army, Cambodian People's Armed Forces&mdash;headquarters in Phnom Penh informed UNTAC that the NADK&mdash;that is, the Khmer Rouge forces&mdash;on routes 12 and 6 had withdrawn from their positions on those roads which they had previously cut off, and that a de-mining exercise by the CPAF had begun. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some matters of detail remain to be sorted out still, but it was proposed and expected that the two companies and support elements from the Indonesian battalion now in the Phnom Penh area will be deployed to Kompong Thom to start detailed reconnaissance of the area. So that particular situation does now seem, as I have said, to be stabilised and back under control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess we can go on expecting situations of this kind to occur from time to time. It is not so much a matter of the Khmer Rouge or others of the factions attempting to win territory for territorial purposes in the skirmishing and manoeuvring that is going on. What is really behind this kind of fighting, as we assess it at the moment, is essentially tactical manoeuvres intended more than anything else as political statements to the Cambodian people rather than as demonstrations of intent to resile from, to walk away from, the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As such, if that is a correct assessment or interpretation of what is going on, I guess we can unhappily expect a few more such political statements to occur, but maybe rather less as more and more UNTAC troops arrive on the scene able to be deployed and as the confidence building that is associated with their presence in the country takes hold&mdash;and that is certainly, I know, the hope of Lieutenant-General Sanderson and the military authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the concern that has been expressed about insufficient detail in the UN plan, it is the case that in most of the public statements, including the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), we have not spelt that out in great detail. But I do remind the Senate, and I remind Senator Hill in particular, that there is an enormous amount of detail spelt out in the report of the Secretary-General on Cambodia, which is a public document of the Security Council dated 19 February. I will table this document at the conclusion of my speech in order that it is available for more convenient reference by honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document in question is a 43-page one which does explain in a great deal of detail the present operational plan and, indeed, all the seven different components of the UN operation that are being put in place. Those components in summary are as follows in the order in which they appear in this document. First, there is the human rights component, which involves both education and oversight and the establishment of a human rights office as part of the civilian administration in Phnom Penh. Secondly, there is the electoral component, which will involve this hugely complex function of registration of voters and the conduct of the election itself, once the demobilisation is complete and the repatriation and return of refugees is complete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third&mdash;and of course most immediately relevant&mdash;is the military component, which has itself four main sub-components in terms of the particular roles that are to be played. The first is verification of the withdrawal of foreign forces. The second is supervision of the cease-fire and related measures, which in turn involves a number of separate operations&mdash;regroupment, cantonment of some 200,000 military personnel, disarming of some 450,000 personnel, including the militias as well as the military, and demobilisation of at least 70 per cent&mdash;to quote the settlement&mdash;of the military, but, of course, hopefully a full 100 per cent. Let me make clear, because Senator Hill made this point, that we certainly hope, and I know the military authorities on the ground in Phnom Penh certainly hope, that a greater degree of demobilisation than 70 per cent will in practice be able to be achieved, even if it was not able to be negotiated in the settlement text. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third main function of the military component will be weapons control, which involves monitoring the cessation of external military support in terms of weapon supply, the location and confiscation of arms caches and the storing of arms. The fourth function is assisting with mine clearance. That was the military component. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next component is civil administration, which, as the Prime Minister's statement says, picking up the language of the text of the Secretary-General's report, is designed essentially to do everything necessary to `ensure a neutral political environment conducive to free and fair general elections'. The precise content of that civilian administration role and how it will work out in practice in terms of looking over the shoulder of the different elements of the civilian administration in Phnom Penh is still in the process of being worked out. It is impossible to be precise about it at this stage, but the task itself has been defined in reasonably clear terms, at least so far as the general principles of it are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Fifthly, there is the police component, which will involve some 3,600 police monitors on the Secretary-General's plan, to which Australia will be making a small contribution, as was announced today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sixthly, there is the repatriation component, which involves, of course, primarily the UNHCR and the Red Cross working with NGOs to secure the repatriation of some 350,000 people living on the Thai-Cambodian border. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there is the rehabilitation component which will require a massive aid effort by the international community, the first manifestation of which will be an inaugural meeting of the International Conference on the Reconstruction of Cambodia, or ICORC, which is planned for Japan in June and in which context Australia's bilateral aid contribution announced today will have a part to play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The particular role to be played by the Australian forces was the subject of query by Senator Hill. Of course, it is outlined in general terms in the statement. There is not an enormous amount more I can add to what is in the statement except to say that on page 22 of the Secretary-General's report the role of the Signals Unit is described in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A total of 582 (all ranks) would be deployed throughout the mission area. This unit would be responsible for the establishment of the force communication net, including ground-to-air communications. In addition, in coordination with civilian communications staff, the unit would assist with the provision of communication to the civilian components of UNTAC.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the context in which I was referring last night to the Australians being involved in a civilian role as well. I was also making the obvious point that in the absence of any telecommunications infrastructure it is essentially going to be a matter for the armed forces signallers to create an equivalent, at least in very outline shape, of a Telecom system for the country. It is a huge job, and it is in that context that the numbers we are talking about should be seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a matter of talking about 582 communicators in the context of just another 2,000, 3,000 or 4,000 people deployed. Remember that we are talking about a military component under this operational plan of 15,900 in total involving many different operational roles, including an infantry element of some 10,200 with 12 battalions of roughly 850 people each. So it is in the context of an operation of this huge scale that this particular logistic support role has been identified and will be carried out by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The deployment of the Australian troops will be a matter for the military commander on the ground, who happens, of course, to be an Australian&mdash;Lieutenant-General Sanderson&mdash;but wearing a United Nations hat, not an Australian one. It is not a matter of defining with the kind of precision that we needed to in the Gulf conflict, rules of engagement and the circumstances for the exercise of independent discretion and so on, because in the Gulf conflict the Australian component of the forces was acting as an independent agency, in effect, although in coordination, of course, with the other forces there concerned. Here it is a rather different operation where the Australians are fully integrated into a UN military exercise and are subject to UN command. Of course, it is always capable for the Australian Government to make the decision that it is unhappy about the way something is developing on the ground and to decide to withdraw the forces thus engaged. But essentially their deployment will be a matter for the UNTAC force commander. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The context in which that deployment will occur has been unequivocally made clear by Lieutenant-General Sanderson as a peacekeeping role, not a peace enforcement role. I do not honestly think there is room for any further confusion about these particular kinds of identified roles. Peace enforcement does involve something analogous to the Gulf war situation where you are going into a manifestly hostile situation, separating forces at war, exercising military force. Peace keeping, as that concept is now well understood, involves not any of that but simply the monitoring, supervision and verification of agreements already reached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some ambiguity about the further expression  `peacemaking'. Peacemaking is usually used in the context of preventive diplomacy or the kind of diplomacy that was involved in actually crafting and bedding down the settlements agreements signed in Paris. But there is a looser sense in which we can talk about peacemaking as being an ongoing task and we can talk about the various UNTAC components having, in a sense, an ongoing peacemaking role to the extent that their presence on the ground will involve confidence building, will hopefully involve the resolution of local disagreements and difficulties, the renegotiation of cease-fire terms, things of this kind that we have seen already happening in Kompong Thom. In an extended sense, that does involve, I suppose, a degree of peacemaking. But the basic peacemaking has been done with the settlement agreements. What is necessary simply is to ensure that those agreements work themselves out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the situation should deteriorate to the point where a major conflict erupts between the various Cambodian armed forces, then it will not be the job of the UN forces to endeavour to separate them, and it will become a matter for judgment by the international community as to how the situation is handled thereon in. But in the worst case scenario, it would involve, of course, the UN and the international community walking away completely from the situation on the ground. That would be a desperately unhappy outcome, but that is the logic of this kind of role, and it has been identified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Finally, so far as the commitment of other countries is concerned&mdash;which was the subject of a further expression of concern by Senator Hill, and also by Doctor Hewson in the other place&mdash;let me say just this. We are in the early stages right now of seeing the acceptance of the invitation to supply components of UNTAC and the deployment of those components. There are Indonesian and, I understand, Malaysian battalions on the ground, as well as the existing UNAMIC contingent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As I said last night in the Estimates Committee, on the information that came to us last night and which has been confirmed this morning from New York, a further three infantry battalions will be employed very quickly from three other countries within the next three weeks, along with a field ambulance unit, a number of police officers and military observers, an engineering unit, other logistics units, helicopters and some naval personnel, with an expected total&mdash;taking into account those already there&mdash;of 4,000 troops on the ground by the third week of April. That is only the preliminary rapid deployment. More deployment will continue to occur over the period ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone acknowledges that it is tremendously important to get as many people as possible on the ground before the dry season is overtaken by the wet. Certainly, it is everyone's hope and expectation that there will be many more troops than just 4,000 on the ground before the wet. However, it was important to get some people on the ground very quickly. By my calculations, approximately 20 countries are now involved, taking those functions I have just described into account, and no doubt there will be many more before the process is complete. That is just the military operation and unquestionably other countries will be involved in the electoral function and other aspects of civilian organisations, as well as the policing function which will be very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A question was also raised about the commitment of other countries towards paying the costs of this operation which are very large. The sum of $1.9 billion is the estimate for the 18-month period and Australia's contribution as a proportion of that has been spelt out. It is the case that to my knowledge a substantial number of contributions have not yet actually been made even to the initial $200m advance amount that has been formally agreed. One would not expect contributions to be paid as yet for the larger UNTAC assessed costs, simply because that has not yet been the subject of a final formal decision. When it is, there is an obligation on countries to pay their assessed contribution within 30 days of that and we can expect to see a rapid influx of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One piece of good news that I am able to report as a result of a cable received a few hours ago from Washington, is that yesterday the US House of Representatives voted very strongly in favour of a $270m appropriation for peacekeeping dues, the largest proportion of which will be set aside for the US share of UNTAC expenses. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I will quote from the Secretary-General's report about this matter. The following words appear on the opening page by way of introduction to all the information which then follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted however that, in spite of the efforts made by these missions, the information obtained cannot be regarded as complete and current assessments regarding priorities and deployment may prove to be inaccurate, as circumstances in Cambodia change. The specific recommendations contained in the present report may therefore need to be re-examined in the light of experience, once UNTAC is in place.</PARA>
<PARA>The urge for absolute certainty in terms of who will be deployed where, from which countries and at what cost is just a misplaced urge at this stage. It is a step by step exercise. We have done very well indeed to get the first steps in place, but there are many more to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has not sought to underestimate the risks associated with this exercise. Australian troops&mdash;as will everyone else on the ground in Cambodia in either civilian or military roles&mdash;will face risks from disease, mines and also from the possibility of cross-fire in the event that the military situation does deteriorate. In that environment it is crucial for everyone to acknowledge the legitimacy or the validity of the task upon which we are all embarked. It is absolutely crucial that everyone in Cambodia who is working for peace&mdash;including the very talented, skilled and devoted members of the Australian defence forces&mdash;feel that they have the support of the Australian community and Parliament. Today that support has been essentially forthcoming from members of the Opposition, the Democrats and, I expect, from Senator Harradine and I thank them all for that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is most unfortunate that when Senator Evans accepted the support of the Opposition and the Democrats for the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the Cambodian peacekeeping mission, he made some very churlish remarks at the beginning about the Opposition and, in particular, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Hill. Senator Evans attempted to repair that somewhat at the end of his speech, but it was a pity that he set the tone of his response which was not at all justified by the support which the Opposition is giving to the extended motion moved by Senator Robert Ray. The Opposition clearly supports the affirmations of support in the Parliament for Australia's participation in the Cambodian peacekeeping operation, and the participation of the Australian Defence Force, in particular, which has a most important role.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout this debate on Australia's role in, and contribution to, peacekeeping in Cambodia, Senator Evans has always expected the Opposition to give him a blank cheque and a pat on the back. I hope that now he has received a pat on the back from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in another place, and from Senator Hill in the Senate, he will feel a little better. Nevertheless, we have not been prepared to give him a blank cheque, nor will we give him a blank cheque today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that this proposed operation, which has been the subject of a great deal of discussion in the United Nations and throughout the world, is recognised in the statement itself as the most ambitious, comprehensive, costly and, without doubt, the most dangerous peacekeeping operation which the United Nations has ever undertaken. It is undertaking this operation in one of the most notoriously difficult, dangerous and unstable places in the world and which has been so for at least two or more decades. It was not surprising that the Opposition&mdash;indeed anyone&mdash;would wish to be satisfied that the position had been reached where a proper peacekeeping operation, albeit one of great complexity and danger, could be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not, by any means, a pedantic concern of the Opposition's. The Prime Minister in his statement, Senator Evans in answer to questions the day before yesterday and Senator Ray in answer to a question yesterday have all emphasised the nature of a peacekeeping operation as distinct from a peace enforcing or imposing operation. That has gone to the heart of the Opposition's concerns, which have been expressed, largely by Senator Hill, over the time in which this operation has been debated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's statement, which was tabled here this afternoon by Senator Ray, states that the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, UNTAC, will have a peacekeeping role which is described as supervising, monitoring and verifying the cease-fire, partial demobilisation of armed forces&mdash;we should bear in mind the nature of those armed forces in Cambodia&mdash;and the cessation of external military assistance. That is the military role of UNTAC. I want to address myself to that in the remarks that I am making in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans has indicated that UNTAC has many other roles. They are important roles, but I think we are really focusing on the military role today. We are supporting the Government's decision to send an Australian contingent of 495 members of the Australian Defence Force to form what is called a force communications unit. Its role has now, thankfully, been spelt out in more detail by Senator Evans in the speech that he has just made. That role, as described, cannot be carried out by the Australian forces. It cannot be carried out by any of the United Nations military forces in Cambodia unless there are circumstances present in that country which enable that role to be performed. This is precisely because of the concerns about the nature of the conditions in Cambodia in recent months, or indeed in recent years, and what could be done in a peacekeeping role in the circumstances as they have been and as they may be up to the present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anyone still has any doubts about the justification for concern in these matters, one has to look only at the first page of the Prime Minister's statement. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If conditions are right in Cambodia, the Government expects that the main Australian contingent will begin deploying during this month.</PARA>
<PARA>Today the Government is still saying `if the conditions are right in Cambodia'. That is what the Opposition has wanted to be satisfied about for months and months. Senator Evans has talked incessantly here and all around the world about the settlement in Cambodia, in which he has played a prominent and leading role. That has been acknowledged. I hope he feels better that Dr Hewson acknowledged it in his speech in another place this afternoon. If that is all he has been worried about, he has been given that acknowledgment. That is not the question. The question is whether or not it is possible to mount a peacekeeping operation of this complexity and size in the circumstances as they are in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest information coming forward from Cambodia is from the United Nations commander, Lieutenant-General Sanderson, who is a distinguished Australian soldier. I take the opportunity of congratulating him personally on his appointment and his promotion to Lieutenant-General. We have every confidence in him. We need to be assured, as does the Government, that the conditions are right in Cambodia. It is clear that the Government cannot say even today in the statement for which we waited about five months that the conditions are right and that the main Australian contingent, another 430 signallers, or communicators as they now seem to be known as, will be on their way to Cambodia. It has not been said today that they are going. It has only been said that if the conditions are right, they will be going before the end of this month. We hope that the conditions will be right and that they will be able to get started on this most important task. We have the greatest respect for them and we are confident that they will perform this task with their usual professional competence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt and no worries whatsoever about the ability of members of our Defence Force to play the role that is expected of them. It is a question of the conditions there and whether they are suitable for them to play this role. All along we have been supportive of the peace process. It is certainly now looking promising that that process will be able to be brought into effect. Nevertheless, one must have grave concerns about the enormity of the task in the time frame that has been laid down here. It is an enormous task to demobilise these forces, establish UNTAC as virtually a government in Cambodia, establish the conditions and administration for an election, repatriate hundreds of thousands of Cambodians back to Cambodia from the border camps and so on, yet it is intended that all that will be achieved in time for an election to be held in May 1993. Those are the sorts of concerns that we have had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already indicated what the military role is. Senator Evans also spelt it out better in his speech today. He provided some answers to questions I would have been wanting to ask had he not done so. They are not really clearly spelt out in this statement. Let us look at the task that this United Nations peacekeeping force will have to perform during this period of 12 months or perhaps less. The force will have to disarm something like 450,000 Cambodian soldiers representing the various factions. They have to be brought into what is called a cantonment where they can be disarmed. As much of that as possible will have to be done during the wet season, which will create great difficulties, as will the fact that the country is infested with mines. The other role, as Senator Evans said today, is to seek out, seize and take away from the factions caches of arms, which are no doubt very extensive throughout the country. It is an enormous role. It is one which will test to the extreme the forces that will be available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans admitted today that only about 4,000 members of the UNTAC military mission would be in place by the end of April; and maybe it will not be achieved as soon as that. The estimate of what is required is about 15,900 military personnel, together with 3,500 civilian police and another 3,000 or more civilian administrators. The number that is to be in place by the end of this month, as Senator Evans has told us today, is far short of 16,000&mdash;in fact, it is only a quarter of the size of the military component of UNTAC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans has indicated that if the conditions are right and the Australians get into Cambodia by the end of this month, as everybody is hoping will be possible, they will be establishing the communications for a total of 16,000, or perhaps 10,000 or so troops in the field&mdash;in Cambodia. They will also have the wider role of providing communications for vital civilian administration. That will be most important from the point of view of establishing conditions whereby elections can be held in Cambodia and a stable administration can be put in place. The members of the Australian Defence Force will have a very important role. They will not all be serving with the military personnel that have been provided. Senator Evans has said that there will be up to 20 other countries&mdash;although there are still a lot of ifs and buts about where those numbers will come from and whether they will all be there in due time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, assuming that this all goes to plan, the members of the ADF in Cambodia will be exposed to a great many dangers. One matter of concern is that they may not be fully protected in some of the circumstances in which they will be serving. I do not think there is any doubt about that and it must be recognised. It is a matter which the Government should be addressing a little more seriously than it seems to be doing. The Government says that although it has not assessed any casualty rate, according to the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) in answer to a question  yesterday&mdash;which is a rather astonishing admission by the Minister&mdash;it is recognising a variety of dangerous situations in which the ADF will be operating. It is certainly up to the Government to ensure that the maximum protection in the circumstances will be given to those members of the Australian forces. Senator Evans has spelt that out in much more detail than was given in the Prime Minister's statement in relation to that particular concern of the Opposition. But for the reasons I have just mentioned, the Opposition still has continuing concerns about the safety of ADF members and about the hazardous nature of the role that they are asked to perform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the military situation is concerned in Cambodia, the statement that we have before us recognises the doubts and difficulties that remain.

<PARA>Indeed, on the track record of the Khmer Rouge, there are likely to be more setbacks&mdash;without any doubt whatsoever. We are not talking about ordinary guerilla fighters; we are talking about a well-organised and well-equipped military organisation which has created mayhem throughout Cambodia for two decades or more and which is still showing signs of its past as recently as the last few days. The Khmer Rouge is a dangerous force. It is no good our hiding from that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is such that it may arise that a peace keeping role is not possible. That is where the real sharp point of concern must be. Who is going to decide that and what will be the actual critical circumstances in which it is decided? It is a relief to hear the Government commit itself very firmly in this statement that, if in fact it is no longer possible to keep peace in Cambodia, the Australian and other United Nations forces will have to be withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter of concern we have had and, indeed, still have, despite what Senator Evans has said, is: what control will the Australian Government have over the making of that decision, if it comes to that? Realistically, we must face the fact that that may well be the case, despite all the hopes that we have and despite the optimism that Senator Evans has, perhaps more than most other people. We may well face that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand from Senator Evans, that decision will be made by UNTAC. I suppose the most influential in that respect will be the military commander there, Lieutenant-General Sanderson. We are very fortunate, indeed, that we have a distinguished Australian soldier there commanding the force. It will give all of us and the soldiers more confidence that careful consideration will be given to their situation. Nevertheless, it is a responsibility which must be assumed and retained at all times by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though there will not be any rules of engagement in the ordinary sense and the command structure maintained over the Australian contingent in Cambodia, as occurred in the Gulf War and similar operations, the Australian Government has the responsibility&mdash;it will always have the responsibility, and it should recognise that&mdash;to ensure that the Australian contingent in Cambodia is not being used beyond the role which everyone so clearly acknowledges is a peacekeeping role, and a peacekeeping role only. That is not a satisfactory situation, as Senator Evans outlined it, unless the Government continues to watch that very closely.

We expect that this Parliament will be consulted if there is any suggestion that the Australian role or the UNTAC role is changing in Cambodia, whether that be by force of circumstance or policy decision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a privilege to rise to support the comprehensive statement delivered by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the House of Representatives and by Senator Ray in this chamber this afternoon. It represents the culmination of a number of years of Australian initiative and skill in diplomacy. It reflects an emerging Australian capacity to play a role in our region and in international relations in a broader sense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is refreshing to see a degree of bipartisanship returning to this debate. As I have said on a number of previous occasions in this place, effective foreign policy, effective defence policy and effective trade policy can really evolve only from a bipartisan basis. Having said that, could I also say that during the time of the public debate on our Cambodian involvement, the Cambodian initiative and the Cambodian peace process, Australian opinion overwhelmingly supported the endeavours of the Government. There is no doubt in my mind that the Australian people at large, and from the very beginning of the peace process, have endorsed the involvement of Australian officials and endorsed the initiatives taken by Senator Evans. In particular, the Australian electorate has endorsed the role to be taken by our armed forces in Cambodia in pursuit of peace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also no doubt in my mind that the Australian people at large acknowledge the extraordinary ability of the ADF in a peacekeeping role. That has been demonstrated time and time again over the decades of our UN involvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the Cambodian circumstance, it is important to begin by recognising that this was the worst civil war in Asia since the Chinese civil war of the 1940s. For a period of nearly two decades it was a particularly brutal, indeed gruesome, conflict. All civil wars are bloody; all civil wars are terribly divisive. The Cambodian civil war was absolutely murderous in its intensity and it proved to be catastrophic in its consequences, not only for that unhappy country but for the region at large. It involved border conflict with Thailand and later an outright war between the Khmer Rouge and the Republic of Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here this evening in the context of the Prime Minister's statement we are endeavouring to deal with the consequences of that civil war, and doing so as a government, as a parliament, in a deliberate and effective way. The Government never sought a blank cheque in this regard, from either the Opposition or the Australian people. We did expect that all Australians would rise to the challenge before the country and the ADF and it is now apparent that the challenge has been met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every peacekeeping initiative in which the Australian armed forces have been involved has been extremely dangerous. There is no doubt about that. During the course of the review of our peacekeeping operations by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade we were personally and directly told by officers of the ADF who had served in peacekeeping missions just how dangerous the task had proved to be. That was especially true of the role of the ADF in the Iran-Iraq peacekeeping mission. In that situation some of our officers separated large contingents of Iraqi and Iranian military personnel who were armed with heavy weapons and separated by only a few metres of mine-strewn territory. At times some of our personnel showed quite astonishing courage in performing the task of keeping those forces separate and avoiding further eruption in a war that had lasted the best part of a decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All peacekeeping initiatives are dangerous. The Cambodian venture is dangerous. There is no doubt about that. However, to put it in perspective, compare and contrast it with the Yugoslav involvement where a United Nations protective force is about to be deployed in that strife-torn country. As Senator Jones asked the other day in a question to Senator Evans, there is every chance that the civil war in Yugoslavia will erupt again. That is an unfortunate truth that confronts us. Nonetheless, the United Nations has a role to play in that country, just as it has a role to play now in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ian Harris, the Executive Director of CARE, said in a recent statement that this venture represents our last chance for peace in Cambodia; that if this initiative breaks down, we are going to see a return to circumstances that plagued Cambodia for the best part of a decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly satisfying to note that an outstanding Australian officer in Lieutenant-General Sanderson has command of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia. That is particularly satisfying. It is well earned and it is a mark of international respect, not only personally for Lieutenant-General Sanderson but also for our armed forces in the broad, given the role that we have played in a range of peacekeeping missions right across the globe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also satisfying to note the cooperative nature of the venture, with troops being committed from a number of countries, including New Zealand, already. It is very satisfying to note the fact that Mr Michael Maley of the Australian Electoral Commission will act as the deputy electoral commissioner for UNTAC. I pay tribute to Mr Maley for his performance in Namibia and for the performance generally of the Australian Electoral Commission over recent years in building and rebuilding, in different and very difficult political circumstances, the electoral framework in a range of countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that one of the key elements in the successful conclusion of the negotiations which have led to the formation of UNTAC is the fact that external assistance to the armed forces, to the factions, in Cambodia has come to an end. The cessation of Chinese military assistance to the Khmer Rouge is a central fact on which the peace process pivots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the Khmer Rouge has an absolutely bloody and intolerable history. There is no doubt that it can continue to create mischief for some time to come, as apparently it is doing in the Kompong Thom province at the moment. But there is no doubt also that that capacity over time will come to a halt. The successful conclusion of a peacekeeping mission and of general elections in Cambodia will hasten that end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the House of Representatives this afternoon, Dr Hewson earned more than a few points with the very reasonable approach that he took to the Prime Minister's statement and with his remarks, bordering on the generous, about Senator Evans. There is no doubt, though, that Senator Evans's performance on Cambodia has been outstanding. There is no doubt also that the Australian Parliament should be proud of the role taken by the Foreign Minister and his officers, just as we are proud of the role that is being carried out and will be carried out by our armed forces personnel in Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of us should be under any illusions about the magnitude of the task that confronts the United Nations in Cambodia. The UN has embarked upon nothing less than the rebuilding of a Cambodian political infrastructure. The UN has embarked upon nothing less than building a new government of Cambodia for the Cambodian people for the future, based upon their own decisions through the ballot box. The United Nations has also embarked upon a process which could lead to Cambodia being readmitted as a full member with all rights in the international community of nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also pleasing to note from the Prime Minister's statement that the multi-disciplinary approach that is being taken by the United Nations is reflected in the determination of the Australian Government to make substantial sums of aid available to Cambodia, as the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, Mr Kerin, has made clear through the allocation of some $49m in Australian development assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that if a new world order is emerging, Cambodia is a very great test of that order. When I use the expression `new world order', I am talking about a system of international relations which is based upon the principles embodied in a charter of the United Nations. Cambodia is a very early and very great test of that new system of conflict resolution and rebuilding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is instructive to compare and contrast the Cambodian situation with that which exists in Yugoslavia. There is no doubt in my mind that in both circumstances there are likely to be setbacks, there are likely to be challenges to the authority of the United Nations and there are likely to be dilemmas that confront us. There is no doubt in my mind that, in both circumstances, the agencies of the United Nations will prove equal to the task. I speak as a member of a political party that, as Senator Bolkus knows only too well, has fought for the authority of the United Nations to prevail since its inception in San Francisco in 1945 at the end of the Second World War. The UN demonstrated its worth recently in the Gulf conflict. I believe that it will demonstrate its worth in bringing to an end the Yugoslav civil war and in bringing to a successful conclusion the peacekeeping mission in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circumstances which led to the prime ministerial statement delivered in the House of Representatives today are those of careful deliberation. There has been an ongoing public debate about our involvement in Cambodia but as I have mentioned previously, there is no doubt where Australian public opinion resides on this matter. Australians have confidence in our capacity to build a peaceful settlement, to find a peaceful solution. And Australians have confidence in the capabilities of our military in the peacekeeping role. That has led to our commitment to Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt either that the successful evolution of an enduring peace depends very largely on the Cambodian people themselves&mdash;not upon the factions, not upon the different military groupings, but upon the Cambodian people. They have suffered greatly. They have suffered terrible injury. But there appears to be no reason to doubt their desire and their determination to make deliberate decisions in the very near future through the instrument of the ballot box. When that happens, I believe we are well on the way to achieving an enduring and just peace for Cambodia and for its people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I endorse the Prime Minister's remarks about the pride with which Australian Defence Force units can be viewed for having played instrumental roles in peacekeeping operations in the Sinai, in Iran and Iraq, in the Western Sahara and, most recently of course, in Namibia. That same remark can also be made about officers of the AFP in Cyprus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, what we all want to see this evening as we debate the Prime Minister's statement is an identical conclusion. We are looking to the future of Cambodia and the region. That really is the vital concern. We are aiming to achieve enduring peace, enduring stability in Cambodia and the region, enduring democracy and enduring progress for Cambodia and for its people. I am very proud to be part of a government that took the initiatives that led to the Prime Minister's statement being delivered in the Parliament today. I conclude by saying that it is refreshing to see bipartisanship return to the debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although I rise to support the statement on Cambodian peacekeeping and the motion that is before the Senate, I am disappointed about two aspects of the debate. First of all, I am disappointed at claims by Government members, which we have just heard again from Senator Loosley, about a past so-called lack of bipartisanship on this issue. As Senator Loosely would know full well, this is not the truth. Secondly, I am disappointed at the lack of detail in the statement on the military deployment aspects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me be quite clear about this so-called lack of bipartisanship. There has not been any failure of bipartisanship on this issue. There have been genuinely held and expressed concerns about the timing and the propriety of the deployment while the offensive continues. But there has been no lack of bipartisanship. What the Government means by that allegation is that an Opposition has no right to question the wisdom of this Government. Of course, I utterly reject that claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to my second disappointment, that is, the lack of detail on what is essentially a military operation. I do not quibble with the Foreign Affairs imprint on the document; obviously it needs to be there. But I do resent the lack of information on the involvement and the deployment of our Force. Senator Hill and Senator Durack have detailed some of the matters we would have expected to have seen included in the statement, so I do not intend to repeat them this evening. Senator Ray's involvement in this document seems to have extended merely to tabling the document in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the wife of an infantryman who was seen off to war in Vietnam by a Parliament which did lack bipartisan support for the involvement, I believe that it is extremely important that it be put firmly on the record that these 495 service men and women have the strong support and confidence of the Federal Opposition. We have, however, expressed our concern not at their abilities, not at their professionalism in the face of danger, but at the lack of information on the current situation in Cambodia over the past weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been kept in the dark by the Government while the much vaunted peace process has been wobbling. Reports from Cambodia have been very disturbing. We believe that our forces are there as peacekeepers, not as foreign participants in a civil war. We have been concerned that their introduction may be premature. Indeed, even the Government, in the statement on Cambodia, indicates that that might be the case. The statement says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If conditions are right in Cambodia, the Government expects that the main Australian contingent will begin deploying during this month.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, there still is the possibility of delay and I would hope that the Government will be putting the safety of our troops first before any need to rush in to be one of the leaders of deploying UN peacekeepers to Cambodia. There is no prize for winning if we take substantial casualties. One cannot help wondering what would have been the role of the main force of our troops if they had already been deployed up-country when the current hostilities had broken out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement refers to the recent fighting in Kompong Thom province. When my colleague the Leader of the National Party, Mr Tim Fischer, visited Cambodia in the New Year, he visited that area. At that time, rocket firing from five to seven kilometres away was clearly heard. He visited the various factions. He had some opportunity to visit our aid workers and projects, and he saw our contingent in Phnom Penh.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also hope to visit our troops in Cambodia during July, just as I visited the first contingent of our peacekeepers in Namibia several years ago. They brought honour on our Defence Force, as I am sure will the Cambodian force. They will be leaving families at home who will worry and wait as we did when our men went to Vietnam in the 1960s and the early 1970s. I have already visited the wife of one of our peacekeepers in my home State of Tasmania. I say to those families that they will not be forgotten. While I hope and trust that the Defence Force and the Federal Government will spring to their aid if they need help over the next year, I also promise that any help which I, as the shadow Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, can give I will gladly give. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the military aspects of the deployment, I must emphasise a matter which has not been spelt out but which must be given attention. I refer to the rules of engagement. What will the arrangements be for changes in the military situation whereby our personnel may need to take action to defend themselves? Who will determine when the rules of engagement are to change? What will the involvement of the Australian Government be in such decisions? What likelihood of delay will there be? The reason for asking these questions is only too clear. Our experience in the Gulf war was that our naval commanders were waiting for commands back in Australia, waiting on the Department of Foreign Affairs, which had no understanding of the pressures of the situation, the time constraints, and the lives of all men on board who needed to be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Government states today that it does not underestimate the need to take every prudent precaution to protect our troops, it must recognise that the working relationships between the United Nations, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Defence, and Lieutenant-General Sanderson, could be very critical to the protection of our troops. I have every confidence in General Sanderson, an extremely capable officer with a strong moral fibre. But the UN is a very bureaucratic and slow-moving organisation and problems occurred in Namibia for our force because of that bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Defence assessed the possible casualties in Namibia as likely to be between 2 and 3 per cent prior to deployment, one can only assume in the absence of such information from the Government that that assessment must be at least as great for Cambodia. The same problems exist of unmapped minefields and armed men still engaging in sporadic fire fights. The assessment in Namibia, fortunately, was over-pessimistic, and I trust that it will not be correct for Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I direct the Government's attention to the value of sending some of our infantry to work with our specialist troops on these United Nations peacekeeping deployments. The safety of our specialist troops would be enhanced, and of value also would be the experience gained by our very professional infantry who to date have had minimal opportunity to get peacekeeping experience. I understand that the United Nations prefers to ask for infantry units from other countries and specialist units from countries such as Australia, but I do urge the Australian Government to look at this question more closely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition supports this deployment of our troops.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know what has been the longest war of the twentieth century, but I suspect the fighting that has been going on in Cambodia, in one form or another, since 1941 means that Cambodia has probably had the longest war of the twentieth century. It is in something like its fiftieth year of war. There was the fighting in World War II. There was the fighting against the French for Cambodian independence. Once that was achieved, there was the beginning of the insurgency by the Khmer Rouge during the late 1950s and the 1960s. Then there was the involvement of the Vietnamese and the Americans along the borders of Cambodia as a result of the Vietnam war. Then there was the direct American intervention in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1970 there was the coup which led to a terrible civil war, which extended until 1975 when the Khmer Rouge triumphed. Then there was the terrible period of the Khmer Rouge in which there was not much fighting; it was just slaughter of their own people. There was the Vietnamese intervention in 1979 to get rid of the Pol Pot Government. Throughout the 1980s there was again civil war as the various factions&mdash;the Khmer Rouge, the Sihanouk faction, and the Son Sann faction&mdash;fought against the government installed in Phnom Penh by the Vietnamese. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not too much of an exaggeration to say that Cambodia's has been the longest war of the twentieth century. The untold suffering through at least three generations of Cambodians has been appalling. But today we are talking about Australia's involvement as part of the UN peacekeeping force. At long last there may be more than just a small glimmer of light for the Cambodian people. The ordinary people, through this process, will have a free election next year and a government of their own free choice, and the fighting will stop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia should be very proud of the role it has played in reaching that settlement. For many years to come Australia's role in Cambodia will rank as one of our finest foreign affairs policy achievements. It will stand us in good stead throughout the countries of South East Asia that we were the honest broker, we were the ones without a vested interest and we were honestly there trying to get peace to this poor, unfortunate country which had suffered 50 years of fighting, much of it imposed on it by others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recognition of Australia's role, we must pay tribute to other countries. It has been mentioned in the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that Senator Gareth Evans, the present Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the previous Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Hayden, should be given particular credit for the roles that they played in the 1980s, and I certainly endorse that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One should remember that, in the mid-1980s when Bill Hayden first started, he was condemned both within this country and elsewhere as being unrealistic in the proposals he put forward. He was followed by Senator Gareth Evans, who produced the red book, the comprehensive plan for the UN involvement in the peace settlement, which the UN P5 overwhelmingly adopted as its own plan. That means that Senator Gareth Evans has a very honoured place not only in the history of this country but also in the history of South East Asia. He certainly deserves the nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize, but it is a nomination that I think he would welcome sharing with a number of other major players. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ali Alatas, the Foreign Minister for Indonesia, should be given special credit for the role that he played in chairing the Jakarta meetings. Many of them ended in deadlock, but he kept going back and calling further meetings. His assistance in that process cannot be ignored. I also think the former Prime Minister of Thailand, General Chatichai Choonhavan, must be given considerable credit for leading a number of the South East Asian countries out of their sterile policy on Cambodia. When he invited Hun Sen, the Prime Minister of Cambodia, to Bangkok in 1989, that was the psychological breakthrough that was needed in relations between the ASEAN countries and Vietnam and Cambodia. The French, as co-chairmen of the peace conference in Paris, must also be given particular credit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to give particular credit to Hun Sen, the present Prime Minister of the Phnom Penh Government. Again and again it was Hun Sen who compromised with the other three factions that were fighting him and his Government, and that led to the comprehensive settlement. I have no doubt that if Hun Sen had been like most leaders who have some sort of power, and had refused to compromise, we would not be where we are today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is remarkable for a man who received little formal education, who was, at one stage, recruited into the Khmer Rouge but fled when he saw the evils of their rule in the late 1970s. He first of all became Foreign Minister in the Phnom Penh Government in the early 1980s and then Prime Minister. He continued to progress and is now a man of considerable political stature. He also deserves an equivalent nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize with the other people I have mentioned. There is much credit to be given to many. It is very pleasing that Senator Gareth Evans, in particular, from Australia is one of those who have been internationally nominated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have the UN going in with a peacekeeping force&mdash;that may, in the end, total 15,000 soldiers and several hundred administrators&mdash;to run the country for the holding of free elections in May next year.

We have also announced that we will be providing a senior electoral official to prepare for the elections next year. We will also be providing other officials as required through the UN. So Australia's role in that country will be significant as part of the UN involvement. </PARA>

Australia is very well served by having such an officer available as Lieutenant-General Sanderson. </PARA>

I first met Russell Stuart some two years ago after he had made several visits to Cambodia as part of initial inquiries about the situation in the country. Russell Stuart is a soldier of considerable initiative. He assessed the situation in the country and often made reports that disagreed with much of the propaganda put out by other countries about the true situation.

She served there for nearly three years, in effect, as the de facto ambassador for Australia, but running the distribution of Australia's aid into that country. Jennifer did a sterling job under considerable difficulties. I first met her there in 1988. It should be noted that she was recently appointed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to oversee the return of 300,000 refugees from the Thai border into Cambodia. That is a mark of the assessment others have made about her capability. We all wish Jennifer very well both for the work she has done and for the work she will be doing in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lyndal McLean, who was Jennifer's successor in the NGO office in Phnom Penh, took leave from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. She is now back in Phnom Penh as the political counsellor in our reopened embassy. Lyndal was an outstanding officer both within the Department and in her job with the NGO office. She did much to educate many of us about the need for a peace settlement for Cambodia. Like Jennifer, she is dedicated and passionate. Lyndal deserves full credit from all Australians for the work that she has already done and the work she will continue to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another person who represents Catholic Relief in Phnom Penh is Onesta Carpeni. She is a Belgian by birth but has represented Australian NGO interests in Phnom Penh throughout the 1980s. She has played a major role in representing the interest not only of Australian Catholic Relief but also of Australia. She has been a passionate supporter of getting a peace settlement for Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that those three women in particular are the sorts of people who do Australia proud anywhere in the world. Hopefully, one day they will get recognition in Australia through the appropriate awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This statement today indicates that Australia has had a major foreign policy success in its initiatives in Cambodia. There is still a long way to go. There will still be many twists and turns and many disappointments. Unfortunately, I suspect that there will still be many people killed in Cambodia&mdash;if not deliberately, then accidentally&mdash;because of the mines that have been left as a result of the long war.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no doubt that this has been a major policy achievement of the present Government. It will stand us in good stead for many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also take note of the concern of many speakers that the lives of some civilian Australians in our peacekeeping force are at risk because of the unpredictable nature of the present political situation. But that is a price that Australians&mdash;certainly those Australians willing to serve there&mdash;are willing to pay. It shows that they are committed and that they know the risks. Our soldiers know the risks, but they are willing to participate in a UN peacekeeping force to achieve that peace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that I do not see it and that it does not occur, but if some Australians are killed, that should not be taken as a failure of our policy in Cambodia. There is always a risk in any situation like this. The risk should not outweigh what we are trying to achieve. I only hope that if, unfortunately, there are some casualties, there is not a mad, hysterical reaction with people saying, `Pull out of Cambodia immediately; it has been a failure'. A failure will occur only if the UN is not able to keep a comprehensive peace until the holding of a free election and the establishment of a freely elected government. We have a chance of really achieving that through this process that has been intricately put together. Let us hope that it all works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, a peace settlement in Cambodia will lead to a future for South East Asia that will be the most prosperous in its history. It will mean that Vietnam and Cambodia will probably be able to join the ASEAN nations and take part in the economic development of the region. I look forward to seeing those countries improve the standard of living of their people so that all countries in South East Asia, not just the existing ASEAN countries, can improve their standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, Australia's role in South East Asia will be very important. We will, therefore, get some benefit from the peace in Cambodia and South East Asia by being able to participate in the economic development of the region as a part of the region ourselves. That is the exciting part in the long term for Australia. With peace in Cambodia and peace in South East Asia, Australia's own prosperity will be enhanced through the trading and economic development of the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the long term, there are real benefits for us being involved in this risky&mdash;I admit that&mdash;and expensive UN peacekeeping force. I am sure that Australians are willing to take that risk. As we have shown over the last 100 years, when we have been called upon to take the risk to defend peace and democracy and establish a better system in the world, Australians have been willing to pay that price and take that risk. I look forward to that achievement over the next 18 months. I wish all Australians well who have committed themselves to that process, particularly those who are going to serve in Cambodia over the next two years. </PARA>

What some speakers have expressed&mdash;which has been clearly acknowledged by Senator Evans, who has contributed more detail to this debate today than the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;is that there are just concerns.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The end result of all our speaking here today is to see a successful outcome to the diplomatic and peacekeeping initiatives that have been taken by many in the world. I recognise the quite new atmosphere in the United Nations amongst the Permanent Five and the Security Council&mdash;indeed, the whole United Nations membership&mdash;in facing such a challenge as seeking to gain a just and stable peace for Cambodia. That atmosphere has changed enormously: firstly, since the end of the superpower rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, with the collapse of the Soviet Union's economy and the extremely improved relations between the republics that made up the Soviet Union and the United States and, indeed, all nations. Secondly, it has changed because of the very decisive action of the United Nations in the resolution of the aggression against Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in this new atmosphere that we express the hope that we can bring solutions to the problems of Cambodia. Not only the children, but also the adults of that country have had a lifetime of war, civil war, death, destruction, genocide and every loss imaginable. It is to that end that we support the motion that is before us. It is to that same end that we want to guard against complacency and ensure that the Government of Australia, in acting for all Australians and our contingent forces serving in Cambodia, is accountable to this Parliament and the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall refer later to the inquiry into Australia's involvement in United Nations peacekeeping operations, which is undertaken by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I was happy to share in the formulation of that Committee's conclusions and recommendations set out in the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">United Nations Peacekeeping and Australia</EMPHASIS>, which was completed and tabled in this Parliament in May last year, some 10 months ago. I want to make it entirely clear that in the undertaking of this peacekeeping mission and in all of Australia's relations to peacekeeping, all of the findings and recommendations of that report are entirely relevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am happy to say that the Government has positively responded to the Senate report, but I want to ensure by highlighting some of our recommendations that it genuinely takes these recommendations into account now and ensures they form part of the guiding foundations as we move step by step into the commitment of the Australian contingent and, we hope, to a successful outcome of the whole peacekeeping activity in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me refer to a number of the recommendations of the Senate report. The first I wish to read in full is recommendation 6, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Australian Government ensure the precondition for Australia contributing to a United Nations peacekeeping force is that all parties are committed to a comprehensive settlement and to the relevant United Nations Security Council and General Assembly Resolutions and United Nations peacekeeping operational plans.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the unanimous finding of Government, Opposition and Democrats senators in the conduct of this inquiry into Australia's contribution to UN peacekeeping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pre-condition is that we can see within any country such a commitment by the parties to the comprehensive plan for resolution of what had been civil war and strife, such that it is responsible to see an international UN force of peacekeepers go in not to enforce a peace but to keep the peace that is represented by the various parties committed to that comprehensive settlement. And not only to the settlement, but also to all of the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations. And not only to that, but also to the peacekeeping operational plans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is concern in the Australian public, certainly in the Opposition and I think amongst most members of this chamber, that this past week and at various times over the last several months since October when the comprehensive settlement was signed by the various parties in Cambodia, we have seen an apparent breakdown of the cease-fire, a breakdown of the bona fides of the commitment to the settlement by one or other party&mdash;in particular, by the Khmer Rouge in the northern part of Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some degree of good news in Senator Evans relaying the withdrawal of the Khmer Rouge from that offensive position on Highway 12 in Cambodia. He referred in his speech to a press conference that Lieutenant-General Sanderson and Mr Akashi had given in Cambodia, I think today, indicating that there was better news&mdash;and even as I speak, the lights are coming up in the Senate&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hear that about a new dawn. I am concerned with regard to Cambodia that there have been a number of new dawns in this respect over the last four to five months. We want to see a permanent and genuinely irrevocable commitment by the parties to the comprehensive settlement and to the operational plans that the peacekeeping force, under the command of Lieutenant-General Sanderson, will put into effect to ensure that the peace is kept in Cambodia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Committee's recommendation 18 refers to a durable political settlement underpinning the peacekeeping operation and an acceptable time frame for the commitment. Recommendation 19 urges the Government to publicise widely in the Australian community the specific peacekeeping operation's details. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that in part, in response to questions for some months now from the Opposition, the Prime Minister in making the statement today addressed a number of the parameters of Australia's commitment to this peacekeeping operation which we believe are necessary for the Australian public and Parliament to know about to enable them to have confidence in the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge, as I did at the outset, Senator Evans's even more detailed statements today with regard to the wider international contribution to this peacekeeping force. He mentioned some 20 nations. He mentioned a resolution in the House of Representatives of the United States today in regard to the $270m of funding towards the $1.9 billion expected cost over the coming 18 months. He mentioned specifics of, as I say, the Khmer Rouge's apparent withdrawal from its breaking of commitments it had made to the settlement in Cambodia. These details are in the direction of recommendation 19 that the Senate Committee has underlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that this debate, the fact that there will be continuing statements made in the progress of this peacekeeping operation, and that the Opposition will be consulted in these step by step developments are all a part of the process of making the public aware and allowing it to be confident that this Parliament shows the right degree of caution in ensuring safeguards for the concerns that we in this Parliament and the public have with regard to deploying any of Australia's personnel from our defence forces to a distant and troubled land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall refer briefly to only four other recommendations. I just remind the Government that this is an appropriate week to look again at recommendation 9 of the Senate report. That calls for a review of service conditions for all Australian personnel who will serve in Cambodia to ensure that there is justice in those service conditions and that proper compensation and proper payments are made to recognise the contributions those Australian personnel are making on Australia's behalf to this peacekeeping operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 10 positively refers to the assistance of the families left behind; of liaison and welfare activities; and, again, of making sure that information is given to those families. I do not doubt that there is every best intention of doing this&mdash;indeed, the Australian defence services have a record of good practices in this matter&mdash;but I want to ensure that the concerns of the Parliament and the Australian people are directly and specifically addressed so that there are procedures in place for assistance to families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Recommendation 17 talks of the involvement of the Reserves and not just regular defence personnel&mdash;and I commend to the Australian Government that that there may be an appropriate involvement for the Reserves. Similarly, recommendation 14 refers to non-government organisations and the obvious benefit in coordinating the safety and the effectiveness of both our defence personnel and non-government organisations in the continuing work in Cambodia over the next 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I come to the final part of my remarks. Having referred to the Senate committee's report, I wish to note that as a member of the Senate I have concerns, which I heard Senator Evans take on board. I mention these concerns again in summary to ensure that the Government remains accountable for them. I want to ensure that there is no complacency. The Government should be mindful of these concerns as we look forward to the success of the Australian personnel in this peacekeeping operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Those five concerns are: firstly, the Khmer Rouge; secondly, the timing, extent and conditions of the Australian deployment; thirdly, the costs and other international contributions to the United Nations peacekeeping force; fourthly, the rate of return and the viable operation of refugees and displaced persons coming back to their homes&mdash;half a million Cambodians are involved; and, fifthly, the need in every step of the process for consultation by the Government with the Opposition in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will elaborate briefly on these five points. I am totally opposed to ever seeing the return of the Khmer Rouge as a dominant force in Cambodia or, God forbid, anywhere near government in that country again, given its despised record of genocide against the people of that country. I still believe that Pol Pot and other Khmer Rouge leaders of that period should be brought to justice for their crimes. I believe that the Khmer Rouge is the one group within Cambodia that has not fully lived up to its signed commitments to disarm&mdash;at least to the tune of 70 per cent&mdash;or to genuinely cease its military operations and actually put into effect a cease-fire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I believe that the Government must continue to maximise realism in regard to the Khmer Rouge and, to the extent of my reference to the precondition referred to in recommendation 6 of the Senate report, confine or urge the confining of the peacekeeping force to those areas where there is genuine active commitment to the preconditions for such a force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> With regard to the second point&mdash;the timing, extent and conditions of the Australian deployment&mdash;I note the ambivalence in a number of the references in the Prime Minister's statement. For instance, he used the words, `if conditions are right in Cambodia'; he talked about `setbacks'; and he even spoke of contemplating that the whole peacekeeping force may `have to be withdrawn'. I note the ambivalence. I believe that each of these points needs to be spelt out to us. There needs to be clarity with regard to the day of commitment, the period of commitment and the conditions of the deployment. These are lacking in the Prime Minister's statement. They have been filled out a little more by Senator Evans; they need to be filled out progressively over the coming weeks and months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has not been a sufficient demarcation or definition in the Government's statement with regard to the difference between peacemaking and peacekeeping. Senator Evans has addressed that more particularly. He has given some arguments as to why the rules of engagement ought not to be as fully spelt out as we have requested, but I am not yet convinced. I believe that we do need to know not only the rules of engagement but also the limits of authority of the Australian contingent commander. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I do not need to expand on the third point&mdash;that is, that we need to know month by month what other countries are contributing to this peacekeeping operation and how that is all coming together in the peacekeeping force under the command of Lieutenant-General Sanderson. We need to know about the costs. Whilst we have heard that there is to be an approximate 40 per cent reimbursement to Australia of the costs outlaid&mdash;the military aspects of this peacekeeping operation are estimated to be about $50m and more than $50m will be outlaid over the next four years in terms of development assistance&mdash;it is still to be seen whether we will be given that compensation and whether the formula under which UN members have undertaken to contribute is followed. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank Senator Ray for ensuring&mdash;following, no doubt, his own considerations and also my direct request during an Estimates committee meeting last Friday&mdash;that the Prime Minister's statement directly addressed the costs of various aspects included in the statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the rate of return of refugees, it will be an enormous undertaking to ensure that almost half a million Cambodians&mdash;350,000 of them&mdash;return from the Thai border to their homes in Cambodia in time to participate in the election due in May 1993. A great deal of realism needs to be applied to that huge undertaking of bringing these refugees and displaced persons back to their homes. Of course, we all wish that homecoming success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Finally, I join with my colleagues in making it very clear that we believe there has been too little consultation too late by the Government with the Opposition in respect of the decisions that have been made up to this point and, indeed, in the detail of the statements that have been made today by the Prime Minister, Senator Ray and Senator Evans. It is essential, I believe, to ensure that the Parliament and the public of Australia are confident that that consultation will be real and timely over the next 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I conclude by wishing all Australians who take any part in the peacekeeping operation in Cambodia every success. I wish them a safe return to Australia and to their families. I wish success not only to the commander, Lieutenant-General Sanderson, but also to the United Nations personnel&mdash;United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Ghalli and Marrack Goulding, who has particular responsibilities within the UN organisation for the administration. I trust that this will lead to eventual real success for the Cambodian people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I table the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the United Kingdom and Austria during July 1991. I have pleasure in presenting this report on behalf of an all-party parliamentary delegation which visited the United Kingdom and Austria last year. Both nations are of significance to Australia and, although visits by members of parliament to the United Kingdom are by no means rare, this was the first official visit by an Australian delegation to Austria. I look forward to greeting an Austrian delegation which is due to visit Australia this year. That visit will occur as a result of an invitation which I extended on behalf of the Presiding Officers to Dr Henry Fisher, President of the National Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not my intention to speak at length about the visit to either the United Kingdom or Austria, because pertinent details are contained in the delegation's report. If, on reading the report, honourable senators have matters they wish to raise with me or other members of the delegation, my fellow Delegation members and I will be pleased to respond privately to their comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I would like to place a few observations on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record. Firstly, the success of the delegation's visit was due to a great extent to the Australian posts in London and Vienna. On behalf of the delegation, I place on record the members' deep appreciation for the assistance afforded by His Excellency Mr Richard Smith, Australia's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, and His Excellency, Mr John Wilson, Australia's Ambassador to Austria. It is my hope that the delegation's activities were, in turn, of assistance to both missions. The High Commissioner, the Ambassador and their staff gave invaluable assistance and advice and gave freely of their time to enable the delegation to accomplish its objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, placing that sincere appreciation on record does not detract in any way from the assistance and hospitality of our hosts in both nations. They, too, made a significant contribution to the success of the delegation. The delegation's appreciation of its hosts is recorded in the report. I trust that when return delegations visit Australia, our Parliament will make a sound contribution to the success of their visits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, on all possible occasions the Australian delegation outlined to its hosts how policies of subsidies on agricultural products in the United Kingdom and mainland Europe are extremely detrimental to the export of Australian agricultural produce and the Australian economy. The delegation's concerns were understood and, in the main, noted courteously. As outlined in the report, two Austrian MPs expressed an opinion about the need for Australia to establish markets in their region of the world. That need is well understood in Australia, but when agricultural policies lead to a subsidy war between Europe and the United States of America, Australia's search for additional markets is undermined. This matter is discussed in greater detail in the report. Despite the lack of success of our discussions in this area, the delegation is hopeful that its remarks added to the already strong diplomatic efforts of Australia's overseas representatives in relation to agricultural subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the course of the visit, members of the delegation were able to savour some of the cultural life of both the United Kingdom and Austria. I should remark that this aspect of the visit was important, because it adds to a further dimension of one's understanding of the countries visited. The cultural highlights in the United Kingdom, to name but a few, were Wimbledon, the Henley-on-Thames Regatta, a production of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">King Henry IV, Part I</EMPHASIS> at Stratford-upon-Avon, the Burrell Collection in Glasgow and the resident, but elusive, ghosts at Fordell Castle, Edinburgh Castle and the Tower of London. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The highlights in Austria included an Austrian heurigan or vineyard inn, many memorable buildings, monuments, parks and gardens in the city of Vienna, Innsbruck Old Town, the Pitztal Glacier and Ambras Castle. I expect that individual members will have special memories of certain cultural activities or visits which the delegation experienced. I have fond memories of all the highlights which I have mentioned, but I will never forget the dinner in the King's dining room in Edinburgh Castle. Perhaps I was so attracted to that particular evening's activities because of my part Scottish ancestry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I extend my sincere thanks to members of the delegation and to those persons who accompanied it. It is always an honour to lead an Australian parliamentary delegation, but this delegation scarcely needed leading. This was due to the helpful, cooperative, perceptive approach of all members: Mr Dobie, my deputy leader; Senator Beahan; Mr Braithwaite; Mr Les Scott; Senator Walters and Senator Zakharov. There was the same approach from the accompanying spouses: Mrs Beahan, Mrs Braithwaite, Dr Walters, my wife Dawn, together with Senator Zakharov's son and daughter. On a personal basis, this delegation's visit rated at least as pleasurable and productive as any overseas visit with which I have been associated. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Honourable senators will recall that the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1991, which for convenience I will refer to as the political broadcasts Act, was passed by the Senate after considerable debate. That debate appropriately concentrated on the policy aspects of its provisions. However, the actual implementation of those provisions would not have been possible without regulations filling out the details of its general framework. These regulations were made under the parent Broadcasting Act 1942, which I will call the Act, as amended by the Political Broadcasts Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of its mandate from the Senate, the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances examined nine separate sets of regulations made under the Act to ensure that they complied with its principles of parliamentary propriety and personal liberties. The Committee found that the only principle which may have been breached was that which requires delegated legislation to be in accordance with its parent Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee considers that it is not certain that some, or all, of these regulations have a valid effect. However, this is a matter upon which opinions may differ and which may only be determined conclusively by a court. In such cases of uncertain validity, the Committee does not express an opinion one way or the other. This is a point which was made by Senator Patterson recently during the condolence motion for Senator Ian Wood. Nevertheless, in this case the Committee decided that it may be useful to set out the issues of legislative scrutiny raised by the regulations. The nine separate sets of regulations dealt with broadcasts in Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales. However, they conveniently fall into three groups of three. I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a table setting out details of these groups. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Regulations in the first group all prescribe the free time to be allocated in respect of elections in those two States and the Australian Capital Territory and the method of allocation of this free time. Those in the second group repeal the first group and remake similar provisions to those made by the first group. The third group amends the first group of regulations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point it should be emphasised that actions have been instituted in the High Court seeking declarations that part IIID of the Broadcasting Act, inserted by the Political Broadcasts Act, is invalid. If these actions are successful and that part is declared invalid, then all of these regulations, which are dependent upon provisions in that part, will also fail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now deal with the first group of three sets of regulations. There are two possible problems with this legislation. First, two of the group of three, those dealing with elections in Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory, contained a regulation providing for their commencement on 1 January 1992. This may have created a difficulty because the first proclamation of Part 2 of the Political Broadcasts Act, which inserted Part IIID containing the amendments upon which the regulations were to operate, was not gazetted until 2 January 1992. The third of this group of three regulations, dealing with elections in New South Wales, was not affected in this way as they commenced on their date of gazettal, 3 January 1992, which was the date of the second proclamation of part 2 of the Political Broadcasts Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second problem with this first group of regulations is that all three sets of regulations in the group refer to section numbers which, in fact, do not exist in the amendments effected by the Political Broadcasts Act. Thus, they appear to have nothing upon which to operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now pass on to the second group, also of three sets of regulations, dealing with elections in the Australian Capital Territory, Tasmania and New South Wales. This second group was made on 3 January 1992, which was the date of the second proclamation of the Political Broadcasts Act, so there is not the same problem with commencement as exists for the first group. However, there are other difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, two of the three sets of regulations, dealing with the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania, were made at a time when there was a motion pending in the Senate for disallowance of the equivalent regulations in the first group, which had been tabled in both Houses. In this context, section 48B of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 provides, in effect, that if a regulation is made while a regulation the same in substance&mdash;and I emphasise `the same in substance'&mdash;is subject to a disallowance motion, then the second regulation `has no effect'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a possible argument that some of the individual regulations in the two sets of affected regulations are the same in substance as those in the earlier group. Here, it is not necessary for the whole set to be the same in substance as the earlier set, but each regulation can be compared with an earlier one. In the second group there were differences in many of the regulations in that correct sections of the Act were included, compared with the incorrect references in the previous group. This could raise the question whether these later regulations were the same in substance as the earlier. This is a matter of legal and factual interpretation to be decided by the courts and, if the later regulations were held to be the same in substance, they would have no effect. On the other hand, if they were held not to be the same in substance, the second group of regulations would stand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third set of regulations in the first group, dealing with New South Wales, had not been tabled at the time the second group was made. Thus, they were not subject to a disallowance motion and so the corresponding set in the second group was not caught by section 48B. However, a similar fate could be argued for the third set in the second group or some of them, relying on section 48A of the Acts Interpretation Act, which provides that if regulations the same in substance are made during the tabling requirement period, they have no effect. It should be noted that if any of the regulations were held to be the same in substance, they would be void and not merely voidable, as is the case if regulations are made and not tabled within 15 sitting days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another problem with the set of regulations dealing with New South Wales in the second group. Cross-references in regulations 8 and 9 refer to regulation 5, when a reference to regulation 6 was probably intended. Indeed, if the cross-references to regulation 5 are correct, then the corresponding cross-references in the other five sets of regulations in the first and second group would appear to be wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next difficulty with the second group of regulations concerns a final provision repealing the equivalent set of regulations in the first group. It could be argued that even if the other individual regulations in the second group of regulations are of no effect because they are the same in substance as regulations in the first group, there are certainly no regulations in the first group the same in substance as these three repealing regulations. If this argument is correct, these three repealing regulations would stand and would be effective to repeal the first group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, it could be argued that the repealing regulations were such an integral part of the whole set that, if the other regulations in the set fell as being the same in substance, these repealing regulations also fall. However, as noted earlier, neither section 48A nor section 48B refers to a set of regulations the same in substance, but refer to `no regulation the same in substance'. Incidentally, the explanatory statements for the second group of regulations offer no assistance, as they provide an outline of every provision in each set apart from the repealing provision, which is not mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This question of repeal becomes important when the third group of regulations is considered, because they purport to amend the first group, which may or may not have been repealed by the repealing regulations in the second group. The third group of regulations was apparently made on the assumption that all the substantive provisions of the second group, including the repeal provisions, were invalid, and that the first group had therefore not been repealed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This third group amended the first group to do two principal things, as well as to make some minor changes. First, they amended the two sets of regulations dealing with Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory to repeal the individual provisions fixing their commencement date as 1 January 1992, with the aim of ensuring commencement after the second proclamation of part 2 of the Political Broadcasts Act. The explanatory statement advised that this amendment was intended to ensure that the amended sets of regulations came into effect, at the latest, on the gazettal of the third group on 10 January 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether this has been the effect will be for a court to decide and will be a test, among other things, of the interpretation of section 4 of the Acts Interpretation Act, under which the first two sets in the first group were made. That section provides that regulations may be made under provisions of a parent Act which have not yet come into operation, although the regulations cannot come into operation before those provisions. Secondly, the third group amended the first group to remove the spurious section numbers and to insert the correct ones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, there are arguments both for and against the validity of the regulations made under the Political Broadcasts Act amendments. In all of these arguments the meaning of the phrase `the same in substance' is crucial. So, too, is the effect of the three repealing regulations. The result is that there are at least two ways in which a court decision could result in there being no effective regulations in force. Firstly, in the actions already commenced, the High Court of Australia could make declarations that part IIID of the Act, inserted by the Political Broadcasts Act, was invalid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that happened, then these regulations, all of which depend on provisions in that part, will not be effective. Alternatively, a court could hold that most of the regulations in the second groups were the same in substance as those in the first group and thus have no effect, but that the repealing provisions were not the same in substance and thus operate to repeal the first group. The third group would then be ineffectual as they merely purport to amend the first group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, a court could hold that there were effective regulations in force. Under this argument the individual regulations, including the repealing regulations, in the second group, would be held to be the same in substance as the relevant earlier regulations and thus of no effect. The first group would thus be held not to have been repealed. In addition, any possible defects in the first group concerning the date of commencement and the wrong section numbers would have been corrected by the third group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As mentioned earlier, the Committee does not express a view on the validity of these regulations. Instead, this survey of possible issues concerning validity is presented generally to assist honourable senators and as a case study of some technical aspects of delegated legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill forms part of a package of five Bills to institute levies and charges on the deer industry in order to fund a research and development program. The proposed levies and charges have been requested by the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia, which represents the majority of deer farmers in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the imposition of a levy on the slaughter of deer in Australia. Three other Bills in this package provide for:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a charge on the export of deer produced in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">levy on the sale of deer velvet produced and sold in Australia, or used in the production of other goods in Australia; and,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a charge on the export of deer velvet produced in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fifth Bill in this package makes provision for consequential amendments to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Australian deer industry is an emerging industry moving from a rapidly expanding phase with heavy dependence on breeding stock sales, to a more mature situation where venison and velvet are the principal income sources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Deer herd has been growing at about 25 per cent per annum on average in recent years. It is estimated that there were about 155,000 deer on over 1,000 farms at the end of 1991. The main species are fallow deer and red deer which make up 50 per cent and 40 per cent of the herd respectively. The remaining 10 per cent are comprised of mainly tropical species. Velvet production offers producers an additional source of income from deer farming with most velvet being destined for medicinal use in Asia. There is also a small by-product industry producing leather.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The approximate value of industry production is estimated at $6m at present. This is expected to double in three years with a herd of 200,000. If the downstream sectors of the industry such as abattoirs, tanneries, wholesale, retail, and exporters are considered, total outputs are predicted to be around $50m.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is strongly committed to building competitiveness and expanding the productive capacity in industries, particularly the primary industries whose contribution to exports underpin our economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's rural research and development policy is central to building competitiveness and expanding productive capacity in rural industries. The Commonwealth provides funding to match industry levies up to 0.5 per cent of the annual gross value of production, encouraging increased rural productivity and profitability through research and the commercialisation of research findings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has to date been funding research and development in the deer industry through the Australian Special Rural Research Fund which is administered by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The deer industry is determined to establish itself as a long term viable rural industry. A Deer Industry Action Plan has been jointly developed by the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia and the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation and has been welcomed by deer producers. This Plan is the result of analysis of the strategic options in the marketing, processing, and production sectors of the Australian deer industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The implementation of this Plan by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation is being funded in 1991-92 from the Australian Special Rural Research Fund. This is currently augmented by voluntary levies, being collected by the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia, on deer numbers behind wire and on deer slaughtered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to raise sufficient funds to implement an effective research and development program in production, processing and marketing aspects of the deer industry, the industry has now chosen to have a statutory levy on all producers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry contributions are expected to be $100,000 in 1992-93, compared with an estimated $25,000 under voluntary levies in 1991-92, and will increase as industry output grows. In providing matching funding the Commonwealth will outlay about $30,000 in 1992-93 rising to approximately $60,000 in 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The levies and charges paid by the producer will be collected in accordance with the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991. The producer levies and charges and Commonwealth contribution will be paid into a separate sub-account under the administration of the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. Further Commonwealth funding may also be provided by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation through the Australian Special Rural Research Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This particular Bill relates to the imposition of a levy on the slaughter of deer to take effect from 1 July 1992. The operative rate of levy is to be set at 18c per kilogram on the hot dressed carcase weight with the maximum rate of levy to be set at 30c per kilogram on the hot dressed carcase weight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for changes to the operative rate of levy to be set by regulation. Prior to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy making any recommendation to the Governor-General on the operative rate of levy, the Minister is to take into consideration any relevant advice from the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia and any other prescribed organisation. Any future operative rates must fall within the legislated maximum rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, it is pleasing to be able to bring these Bills before the Senate. They mark the emergence of another viable rural industry which will further broaden the economic base of agriculture, replacing imports and expanding into the export market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the farm level, the establishment of a viable deer industry in Australia offers the opportunity to diversify income sources and reduce exposure to individual commodity downturns.</PARA>
