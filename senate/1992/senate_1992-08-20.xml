<TITLE>Sales Tax Simplification Legislation</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="FLUSH-RIGHT">10th August 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Member,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We the undersigned are writing to you to voice our strong objection to the proposed "Sales Tax Simplification".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our main concern is that if this legislation is implemented a major industry (and therefore jobs) will cease to exist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To quote from a V.A.C.C. letter dated 29 July 1992 to all farm machinery dealers the F.M.D.A. "estimates this impost alone will cause up to 150 dealers to close their doors putting as many as 2000 people out of work in rural Australia".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This proposal will further diminish the strength of the Farm Machinery Industry; an industry whose owners and employees are already struggling in these current economic times. The number of businesses has already fallen from a high of 2400 dealerships in 1984 to a current number of approximately 800. (Figures as supplied by V.A.C.C.).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the forecast closure of a further 150 dealerships the industry will have effectively been reduced by nearly 75% in the past 8 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a time when job creation is first and foremost in the minds of both public and politicians it seems ludicrous that this proposal may cause many hundreds of hardworking and specially trained people to join the growing ranks of the unemployed&mdash;not to mention the effect to supporting businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As everyday working class people we find it difficult to comprehend why a revenue raising industry will be further sacrificed to prop up our failing economy. Where will it all end?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We hope you will express these concerns to the Senate and do your utmost to quash this proposal being implemented.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We, the undersigned, formally notify you of our objection to the proposed Federal Government National Accreditation system for child care centres in Australia. The system is unworkable and unrealistic in terms of what it will supposedly achieve for our children. It will result in the reduction of valuable child care places (at a time when it is reported that there is a crying need for more child care places) and a galloping increase in child care fees for all parents, either on fee relief or not. At no time has the Federal Government sought our opinion as parents, nor consulted us on what we want or feel are accepted standards. Quality child care cannot be legislated for&mdash;it comes from the heart. The Interim National Accreditation Council system is neither workable or affordable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will not allow elitism, in the form of a star rating system to invade the child care arena. All children in Australia are entitled to affordable quality child care and we will under no circumstances accept the National Accreditation system proffered by the Interim National Accreditation Council.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1X4">Senator WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will be aware that, since its inception, this Committee has been extremely active in an area characterised by great complexity, rapid change and singular significance, not only to the growing numbers in the older age groups, but also to the economic well-being of the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is seeking this extension for two basic reasons. The first is that of its 17 terms of reference, seven remain to be reported on. The outstanding issues include taxation arrangements, matters relating to the vesting and preservation of benefits, lump sums and annuities, the inter-relationship of superannuation with the age pension, implications for the financial system, and a number of consumer issues. All these are matters of great importance and all have their difficulties and pitfalls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Government has indicated that it will respond to the Committee's first report&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Safeguarding Super</EMPHASIS>&mdash;at an early date and introduce legislation during these sittings. The Committee believes that it would be highly desirable for it to be in a position to examine this response, taking advantage of the expertise it has acquired during the past 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes that it will be better able to discharge the important tasks given to it by the Senate if this motion is passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a short statement setting out in more detail the reasons for this extension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the Committee started work a year ago, it has produced an information paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Super System Survey</EMPHASIS> which described retirement income practices in 21 overseas countries. It has tabled two reports&mdash;Safeguarding Super and Super Guarantee Bills and a discussion paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Super Charges</EMPHASIS>. The Chairman has made two statements in the Senate on matters arising in the course of the Committee's work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After the Committee was established, the Government released major policy statements on prudential supervision of superannuation funds, information to be provided to fund members, the proposed superannuation guarantee levy and, on 30 June last, a comprehensive statement on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Security in Retirement</EMPHASIS>. The Superannuation Guarantee legislation was introduced and passed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">None of these developments had been foreshadowed at the time the Committee was formed and all have added to its workload.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's work, and in particular its reports and other pronouncements, have greatly stimulated public interest in superannuation. Submissions are still being received and now number 238. Many of these record complaints covering a wide range of topics and have tended to place the Committee in the role of consumer advocate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining terms of reference go to the heart of the design of superannuation schemes and the development of appropriate government policies. Many aspects of them are technically complex and all are politically sensitive. If the Committee is to make a worthwhile and lasting contribution in this area it will need to proceed with thoroughness and caution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has indicated its adoption in principle of the Committee's first report Safeguarding Super which recommended the implementation of a wide range of prudential controls over the establishment, administration and investment activities of superannuation funds in the interests of safeguarding members' assets. The Committee believes that it should play a part in the examination of the Government's response in the light of the experience it has gained during the conduct of its inquiries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislation will be required to implement the Government's decisions, probably resulting in the further reference of bills to the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the light of these considerations, the Committee feels that an extension of its reporting time to 14 December is warranted and seeks the agreement of the Senate to this course.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">OCCUPATIONAL SUPERANNUATION STANDARDS REGULATIONS APPLICATION BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill proposes to ensure the validity of amendments to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations to reflect the superannuation guarantee arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the basis of legal advice, the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992 (SG Bill) was not presented to the Governor-General on 30 June 1992. That advice indicated that it would not be appropriate to seek Royal Assent owing to the fact that the SG Bill was not passed in identical form by both Houses of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legal advice on 30 June was that the amendments to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations could proceed and could come into effect from 1 July 1992 even though the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill had not been enacted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That advice was on the basis that 1 July 1992 would be the commencement date for the SG Bill, when it was enacted, and that it would follow that the commencement date of the amendments to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations would be 1 July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsequent legal advice raised doubt about the validity of this approach. In consequence, the government decided to introduce the present Bill to place beyond doubt the validity of the amendments to the regulations from 1 July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This decision was taken to provide certainty for employers, fund trustees, employees and the superannuation industry generally that the superannuation guarantee arrangements are in place as announced. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NATIONAL PARKS AND WILDLIFE CONSERVATION AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 came into effect there has been increasing recognition for the need to effectively manage the marine environment. The extent of this area is significant. The Australian Fishing Zone occupies a larger area than Australia itself and the Commonwealth Government is responsible for managing the majority of this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Marine areas differ from terrestrial areas in terms of their management requirements. The migratory nature of many marine species, the seasonal shifts in currents and nutrients, and the ease of transport of pollutants such as oil and the relatively limited knowledge we have of marine systems requires that comprehensive legal and management programs be developed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments to be included in the Bill are intended to ensure that the enforcement provisions of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 are adequate for the purpose of protecting those marine reptiles, birds and mammals to which Part III of the National Parks and Wildlife Regulations applies, by making the powers in the Act consistent with, and no less stringent than, the enforcement powers in the Whale Protection Act 1980 and the Fisheries Management Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for the amendments arises from the agreement by my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, that it is inappropriate for management of marine mammals and marine reptiles to be under commercial fisheries legislation, and that responsibility for those animals should be transferred to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. The Fisheries Management Act specifies that the term "fish" does not include marine reptiles or marine mammals, unlike the former Fisheries Act, and it is now necessary to ensure that the provisions of the NPWC Act are adequate to protect those species of animals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph 71(2)(b) of the Act provides for the making of regulations for the protection and conservation of wildlife and subsection 3(1) specifies that the term "wildlife" includes animals and plants that are indigenous to the continental shelf of Australia or the superjacent waters. Those provisions of the Act are implemented through Part III of the National Parks and Wildlife Regulations, which applies in or on the continental shelf of Australia, the superjacent waters, the sea-bed and subsoil beneath those waters and the airspace above those waters. Part III protects specified animals and plants and provides for a licensing system administered by the Director of National Parks and Wildlife. In general, a licence to kill, take, keep, sell or purchase a protected animal or protected plant may only be issued for the purpose of scientific research, educational study or non-commercial propagation. Exemptions to some of the provisions of Part III apply to traditional Aboriginal hunting and to certain aspects of licensed commercial fishing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The animals protected under Part III of the Regulations are listed on Schedules 1, 2 and 3 of the Regulations. Currently, the groups of species covered by those Schedules comprise sea snakes, seals and birds. Arrangements are in hand to add turtles, crocodiles and dugong to the Schedules in the near future, through an amendment to the NPW Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With sea snakes, turtles, crocodiles, birds, seals and dugong protected by Part III of the Regulations, and whales and dolphins protected by the Whale Protection Act 1980, all marine reptiles, birds and mammals will receive protection in Commonwealth Waters under legislation administered by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For logistical reasons, and for efficient use of resources, enforcement of that legislation will in many cases be delegated to officers from Commonwealth or State fisheries or nature conservation agencies, who will receive appropriate appointments under the Commonwealth legislation. For example, a group of officers from the Victorian Department of Conservation and Environment has already received appointments as inspectors under the Whale Protection Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill proposes the creation of a new category of enforcement officer with powers of enforcement able to be limited so that they apply only to offences against specific regulations in Part III of the NPW Regulations. The new category of enforcement officer is to be known as a wildlife inspector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because Part III of the Regulations and the Whale Protection Act complement each other in the protection of marine mammals, the enforcement powers available under those pieces of legislation need to be consistent. Furthermore, because the protection of such species of marine wildlife as turtles and dugong is being transferred to Part III of the Regulations from the former Fisheries Act, the powers of enforcement should be at least as stringent as they were under that legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Effective enforcement requires that officers have powers to arrest without a warrant, seize evidence, and search a vehicle, aircraft or vessel in connection with an offence. Under the Whale Protection Act and the Fisheries Management Act, enforcement officers have powers of that kind. Under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, however, those powers are only available to wardens in Australia and in the Australian coastal sea. Amendments proposed in the Bill are intended to extend the application of those powers to the continental shelf, so that wardens and wildlife inspectors can use those powers when enforcing Part III of the Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to achieve consistency with the Whale Protection Act, the Bill will provide wardens and wildlife inspectors with the power to require a person in charge of a vessel to give information concerning the vessel and its crew and any person on board the vessel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to achieve consistency with the former Fisheries Act and the current Fisheries Management Act, the Bill will provide wardens and wildlife inspectors with the power, pursuant to the consent of the owner or occupier of the land or premises or under a warrant, to enter and search land or premises where there are reasonable grounds to believe that there may be evidence as to the commission of an offence.</PARA>

At present, the Grain Legumes Levy Act 1985 (the Act) provides for the imposition of levies, on specified grain legumes, at flat rates per tonne of seed as recommended by the Grains Council of Australia (GCA) which is the representative organisation under the Act. These can be increased by regulation up to a maximum rate also specified in the Act. The levy rate for most grain legumes is currently $1.25 per tonne. Peanuts are levied at $2 per tonne and navy beans at $5 per tonne.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pick up briefly on a remark that Senator Baume made in relation to one of the Acts under consideration for amendment, that is, the National Gallery Act. As Senator Baume quite rightly pointed out, this Bill will change the name of the Australian National Gallery and this could entail a considerable cost for the ANG in changing its mastheads, letterheads and so forth. I think it is rather strange that the explanatory memorandum says that there will be no financial obligations imposed on the Commonwealth by this Bill. I fail to see how a name change of this magnitude will not entail financial obligations on the gallery as it seeks to change its mast-heads, letterheads, and so forth, to comply with the new legislation. Perhaps the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) could give us some financial details as to what it would cost the gallery to change these things in line with this name change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, the Bill does contain a range of amendments to a range of Acts administered by the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, and the Australian Democrats will not be opposing this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also repeals the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests (Commission of Inquiry) Act 1987 and the States Grants (Air Quality Monitoring) Act 1986.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the opinion of the Australian Democrats, this provision is to be supported and represents a further devolution of land management from the Department to the National Capital Planning Authority.

Senator Sowada has just mentioned the aspect relating to the National Capital Planning Authority which comes within my jurisdiction as the spokesman for the ACT on behalf of the Opposition. I want to indicate that we do support that fairly minor technical amendment to the Act so far as it relates to the National Capital Planning Authority having responsibility or power and jurisdiction to deal with national land that is the responsibility of the Federal Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not much more that needs to be said on that, but before resuming my seat I want to highlight a suggestion that has been doing the rounds in Canberra that possibly Canberra and the Australian Capital Territory should be nominated for World Heritage listing. That proposal is around. It is one that I guess will come to the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory in the not too distant future. I just alert Canberrans to the matter so that they may give it some thought and possibly have some input into whether the Australian Capital Territory and Canberra should be listed for World Heritage listing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not quite sure what that would mean. I am not quite sure whether it would require the consent and concurrence of the ACT Assembly or of this Federal Parliament, because the Minister does seem to have a lot of power in determining things that happen with Canberra as a Territory. I alert the Parliament to the difficulties with World Heritage listing of the North Queensland rainforest and the severe curtailment that was put on any activity in those areas as a result of World Heritage listing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not quite sure what World Heritage listing would mean for Canberra. I am not sure that too many others are too certain about what would happen. But if it followed World Heritage listing of other parts of Australia, it could mean that we would have to apply to the United Nations or to the World Heritage Commission or advisory body to get permission to do anything at all within Canberra. If we wanted to build a road, construct a fowl house or build a new Foreign Affairs building&mdash;things like that&mdash;maybe we would have to go overseas to seek permission; I do not know. Certainly, in the World Heritage listed rainforests, if one wants to do anything at all, one has to go through a series of people to try to get permission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one of those things where a lot of people will say that it is taking sovereignty out of the hands of Australians. I accept that with the World Heritage listings of the rainforests there was an exclusion clause saying that development of a particularly important national nature could go ahead in the rainforest areas, provided the Australian Government approved. But it is all one of these things that comes from overseas; it is determined from overseas. One just wonders whether our national capital should be put in a position of in some way, however lightly, being subject to decisions from other people on what should possibly happen in our national capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that is how it would apply to Canberra, because it seems to be rather vague and the proposals doing the rounds are fairly unclear about the subject. I am simply raising the matter at this stage to alert the people of Canberra to that suggestion that is doing the rounds. They can consider it and if they have any thoughts on it they can contact Senator Reid or me with their thoughts on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, can I concur with what Senator Baume has said and indicate again that the Opposition&mdash;as indicated by Senator Baume&mdash;will generally support the motion, with the qualifications that Senator Baume has made.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I wish to respond to the one substantive point that was made by Senator Baume in the debate last night, that is, the question of the changes to be made to appointments. At present the Chairperson and some members of the Australia Council are appointed by the Governor-General acting with the Minister's advice. But because chairpersons of the Council boards are appointed by the Minister and are ex-officio members of the Council, these other members of the Council are effectively appointed to the Council by the Minister alone. I think Senator Baume conceded last night that that in itself made sense. It is considered more logical, and less expensive for administration, for the Council's Chairperson to be appointed by the Governor-General and for all other Council members and board members to be appointed by the Minister, or by the Council as the Minister's delegate. Thus the change from Governor-General to Minister in this Bill is addressed to the special structure of the Australia Council. The Government has not decided to apply it in a general way to other statutory authorities in the remainder of the portfolio. If the Government were to do that, of course, the Government would introduce all the amendments at once. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The six Bills which are the subject of this debate are six sales tax Bills which purport to re-write the sales tax legislation of this country, legislation which has been in existence since 1930 and which, of course, has been amended from time to time&mdash;indeed, many times&mdash;over the ensuing 60 years but which has now been subject to the most thorough ongoing review in the 60 years of its existence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are at the moment something like 27 Acts of Parliament relating to sales tax, and the six Bills that are the subject of this debate today are the rewrite in essence of that existing legislation following review of it, essentially by the Australian Taxation Office. I will come back to the consultation process in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The genesis of these Bills came in the 1990 Budget when the Government announced that it would be undertaking a review of the sales tax law with a view to simplifying it. To use the Government's words, the whole thing was supposed to be purely `a simplification process'. What, I think, this debate will clearly demonstrate and what the work of the Senate Select Committee on Sales Tax Legislation, which has met in recent weeks, will demonstrate is that the proposed legislation, far from being a true simplification of the main concerns and complexities of sales tax law in Australia, will be at least as complex as the preceding legislation and will not really solve the grave complexity of issues that are inherent in any wholesale sales tax regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, I might say at the start of this debate, is absolutely the reason why the coalition, on coming to government at the next election, will abolish the existing wholesale sales tax regime, whether it be the existing 27 Acts or, if these six Bills get through the Parliament, the consequential six Acts, because a wholesale sales tax regime is fundamentally flawed. If we have a wholesale sales tax regime, we inevitably get in it the problems of anomalies, inconsistencies and complexities that have bedevilled the sales tax system in this country for so many years at such cost and inequity to the whole of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be abolishing whatever sales tax regime we inherit and, as part of a major reform of the taxation system in Australia generally, we will be replacing it with a goods and services tax, which, by its very nature, will remove automatically virtually all of the inequities and inefficiencies of a wholesale sales tax regime. The abolition of the wholesale sales tax system and its replacement by a goods and services tax regime, which is a value added tax regime, will be only part of a major tax reform in Australia that will include an average reduction across the board of personal income tax, targeting particularly lower and middle income earners, of 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third main string to the tax reform&mdash;the first being GST and the second being income tax&mdash;is the abolition of no fewer than seven taxes that now are imposed on business in this country, at very great cost to our whole cost structure and therefore to our competitiveness as a nation. The present tax structure in Australia is very negative in terms of encouraging competition amongst Australian industries and in terms of their ability to compete overseas in export markets and to compete in the domestic market against imports. It is a major drag on the Australian economy. It is a major drag on our productivity. It is a major drag on our investment. It is therefore a major cause of the absolutely horrendous unemployment situation that we have in this nation today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have seen from the figures contained in the Budget released two days ago and supplemented by Treasurer Dawkins in comments he made yesterday, unemployment will continue at around the same levels under the Government's existing policies for at least another four years. That will be a matter of heated debate on many more occasions in this place and I will not go into that further today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the backdrop to the six sales tax Bills that we have before us today. The Bills are said to represent the Government's attempt to simplify the horrendously complex, gargantuan, archaic, arcane, regressive, unfair and anomaly ridden wholesale sales tax system. If I have not already made it clear enough, let me make it absolutely clear at the outset that the Liberal and National parties are totally opposed to the Bills and will vote against them, even as they are now proposed to be amended very substantially by the Government. We will come back to that on many occasions in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the six Bills before the Senate at the moment, which were rammed through the House of Representatives in 45 minutes flat by the use of the guillotine in the dying days of the last sittings, are to be massively amended and indeed emasculated by many of the changes proposed by the Government following its extensive two-year review. The Government is now backing off. It has pulled its head in. It is proposing to eliminate quite major sections of these Bills. So we are going to see a very emasculated and therefore a very messy, equally inequitable and inefficient system replacing the one that we already have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government claims that these Bills represent a major overhaul of the existing sales tax law. The Government claims that the result is a major simplification of the system. Certainly the Taxation Office has laboured long in its work on this matter. The simplification review was first announced by the Government in the August Budget of 1990 and it was only on 2 April this year, in a press release by the Treasurer, that the results of that review were announced. The legislation itself did not come immediately into the House of Representatives; it was not seen for the first time until 26 May. It was guillotined through the House of Representatives in the most brutal, undemocratic, unparliamentary way, with no opportunity for debate, no opportunity for consideration or input by those millions of Australians who are going to be affected by these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The results of these labours&mdash;which have been largely in-house with virtually no real consultation with the clients of the system, those who are actually going to have to pay tax, the tax practitioners who advise those who pay the tax, and so on; I will come back to that lack of consultation&mdash;certainly do represent an overhaul of the existing system. It is an overhaul which has not removed many, if any, of the fundamental weaknesses in the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prima facie, those results may be interpreted by some to have included some simplification in the sense that it is now proposed that we will have six Acts of Parliament rather than the 27 Acts which deal exclusively with sales tax, but that does not, in itself, mean that the real end result is the true simplification of the wholesale sales tax regime. The main problem with the wholesale sales tax regime, so far as its complexity, its confusion and its inequity are concerned, relates to the area of exemptions and classifications. How can one product, one good, be classified as having a particular rate of sales tax applying to it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a multi-rate system. There are five rates of sales tax: zero, 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 20 per cent and 30 per cent. In many cases the dividing line, in terms of defining a product as to whether it should be eligible for a 10 per cent rate, a 20 per cent rate or a 30 per cent rate, is very fine indeed. Most of the cost and the complexity in the system arises from the classification process and the process of exemption from sales tax at all. Again we have problems of definition. They are the real problems in the sales tax system, not the fact that there were 27 Acts and there are now going to be six Acts. The exemption and classification problems within the sales tax system have not been tackled at all in the review that the Tax Office has undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bills were rushed through the House of Representatives without any consideration. They were to have been allocated a brief four hours for debate in the Senate in the dying days of the last sittings, because the Government was at great pains to push the legislation through the Parliament so that it could have an operative starting tax collection date of 1 September or 1 October. The Government was going to apply the same guillotine process to these Bills in the Senate as it did in the House of Representatives. The coalition was violently opposed to this and I welcome the support that we received from the Australian Democrats for the establishment of a Senate select committee to examine those Bills. That examination has taken place over the recess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must temper my expression of pleasure at the support of the Democrats by being bitterly critical of the fact that they were not prepared to support the coalition in having a suitably lengthy timetable for the consideration of the Bills. Instead, they supported a request by the Government that the Select Committee report by yesterday, 19 August. That gave the Committee a period of only six weeks from go to whoa to establish itself, to advertise its existence, to call for submissions, to receive submissions, to conduct the public hearings, to prepare the report, produce it, agree on it and table it in the Parliament. That was an impossibly tight timetable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, the report that I think was tabled in the Senate yesterday by the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Walsh, is in my view very inadequate. That is no reflection on the secretariat that laboured very hard and long to support us and which was cooperative in the extreme. But that secretariat was given&mdash;as were we members of the Committee&mdash;a totally impossible timetable and, as a result, our consideration of the Bills suffered mightily. I believe that the Australian taxpayer will pay the consequences of that as well, to a large degree, because we have not done the job that the Senate mandated us to do. Indeed, we had only two days of public hearings, which took place last Wednesday and Thursday, 12 and 13 August. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At 6 p.m. on the night of 11 August, the Treasurer put out a very skinny three-page press statement which heralded major changes in six areas that the review and the Bills that the Committee was to consider had covered. There were no amendments available for the Committee to look at the following morning and, indeed, they did not turn up at all during those two days. So the Committee was working very much with one hand tied behind its back because of the changes foreshadowed by the Treasurer, but without the specific details of those changes in the form of the amendments and, indeed, with the other hand tied behind its back because of the impossibly tight time constraints that we had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minority report by my colleague Senator Vanstone and me very strongly and totally condemns the Government for the way that it has handled this matter. It obviously acted to pre-empt, frustrate and confuse the operations of the Senate Select Committee. That is a major indictment of the Government because it is a classic example of the Government frustrating the legitimate, proper parliamentary process which is the underpinning of any democratic society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the establishment of the Select Committee, after the brutal guillotining of the legislation through the House of Representatives, the coalition had representations flooding into us expressing grave concern about both the thrust and the detail of the Government's changes as outlined in the six original Bills. The Senate Select Committee had similar representations flooding into it. Indeed, in the space of the very tight 2 1/2 weeks that the Australian community had to make their submissions to the Committee, despite that tight timetable, we received no fewer than 150 submissions. That reflected the very grave concern, community wide, about the proposals before the Senate then and now, despite the changes that the Government is proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those representations came from a very wide spectrum of the community. They came from the manufacturing sector, the retail sector, consumers, legal and accounting practitioners, large and small businesses, the finance sector, the oil companies, the architectural and design professionals, and on and on it went. The extremely large number of differing concerns from this very wide range of representations did not involve merely matters of detail. They included, and still include, grave concerns about the fact that 250,000 farmers, for many of whom present incomes are negative, will be brought into the sales tax net for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They include the fact that probably another quarter of a million business people, who are not at the moment required to register for sales tax purposes, will have to register in order to obtain various exemptions in terms of business inputs. In other words, the sales tax net is going to extend to include up to or perhaps even more than half a million more taxpayers than it now covers. If that is not bureaucracy gone mad and if that is not the tax system gone mad, I would like to know what is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other concerns that came in included grave concerns about the possibility that many taxpayers would be hit for substantial retrospective liabilities of tax, and tax penalties. A leading member of one of Australia's largest and most respected accounting firms has described the Government's proposals as providing a `recipe for uncertainty and confusion' and as leading `to a great number of distortions and to many unintended consequences'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Grave concern was expressed in many quarters about the powers that the original Bills conferred on the Australian Taxation Office, including the quite draconian penalties that the Taxation Office could impose. The Business Council of Australia, for example, described the Bills as conferring absurd and dangerous powers on the Tax Office, `enabling it to deem facts to suit its case regardless of the actual facts'. The Business Council claimed that the Bills, `with their Orwellian overtones, would grant the bureaucracy powers that are simply unacceptable in a democratic society'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be significant amendments proposed to the Bills but I do not think the underlying intent will change. Under the Bills as originally drafted, the Taxation Commissioner certainly would have had enormous powers, not just to impose draconian penalties on people but also to exercise enormous powers of interpretation. I take as an example proposed new section 92 of the Bill as drafted when it came into the Senate and as it read when it was brutally guillotined through the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed new section 92 gives the Tax Commissioner the power to cancel tax benefits obtained by avoidance. That is fair enough; there is no dispute at all about that in principle. Let us look, however, at the power of interpretation or determination that subsection (2) of proposed new section 92, as drafted when it came into this place, conferred on the Commissioner.

<PARA>I do not know whether the Tax Office or this Government realises that the totalitarian regimes of eastern Europe have come crashing to the ground in the last couple of years. This type of legislation seems to be an attempt to resurrect in Australia what has been destroyed&mdash;and absolutely rightly so&mdash;through the communist regimes of eastern Europe, notably a totally draconian, Orwellian and undemocratic approach to the taxpayers of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to record that, following the work of the Select Committee and its establishment and following the huge number of representations that have been received, we have been informed that the Taxation Office is proposing&mdash;and there are amendments&mdash;to change the wording of that proposed new section. I repeat the point: if the Senate had not exercised its proper right of review, that proposed new section would today be law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will no doubt argue, and has argued, that that wording and the general anti-avoidance provision from which it comes is based on part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act. That was the original argument, I think, but the comparison is quite misleading. Section 177D of the Income Tax Assessment Act lists eight criteria which must be satisfied before part IVA applies. In the original sales tax Bills no such criteria were included. I am pleased to note, as I understand it, that objective criteria will now be included. But again I come back to the fact that that was not the Australian Tax Office's or the Government's approach and that it was only through enormous community concern and concern expressed by the Liberal and National parties that that change has been made, although, as I say, it in no way changes the basic underlying intent of the section. I will be asking questions and seeking total confirmation, in the committee stage of this debate, as to whether the revised general anti-avoidance procedure provisions of the Act do, in fact, totally exclude the prospect of catching up normal commercial transactions. We will be seeking a total assurance from the Government on that account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Setting all that aside, the fact is that these Bills generally reflect a government which, despite all its rhetoric, is profoundly hostile to business. It is, in effect, profoundly hostile to the activities of the great majority of the population&mdash;those millions of Australians who generate most of our national income. Our national income is not generated by us politicians, or by the bureaucrats in Canberra or elsewhere around Australia. The income, wealth, jobs and prosperity of this country are generated by those businesses and those business people&mdash;large and, particularly, small businesses&mdash;around the nation who are striving simply to be able to do what they can do best, free of the encumbrances and interferences and Orwellian involvements of government in their activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole thrust of this Government in its actions&mdash;I think reflected in an important degree in these Bills&mdash;is to be hostile to those activities of the private sector in this country. No wonder we have the one million people unemployed and a further one million people underemployed as a result of the policies and general approach of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us just look at some of the recent examples. In addition to these sales tax Bills, to which I will return later, we have Senator Cook introducing legislation to meet the dictates of his old union bosses in the Building Workers Industrial Union&mdash;a union of which he is still a member. How is that for a conflict of interest? That legislation, however much watered down, can only erode confidence in the stability of private contracts and increase the costs and risks of doing business in this country. </PARA>

We have the same Attorney-General proposing changes to the trade practices law which would have the effect of ensuring that Australian based companies remain small and uncompetitive in world terms or face protracted and costly legal battles with their own government. We have a Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and a Treasurer who are beholden to and, without any scruples, will placate or buy off the Australian Council of Trade Unions and in particular Bill Kelty, or, in the Prime Minister's case at least, attempt to repay the debt of assisting him mightily in his ruthless drive for the Lodge last year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the six sales tax Bills now before the Senate, I have to declare my interest in them as a primary producer. I also intend to comment generally on the whole mishmash of the legislation. Sometime in 1985, in the other place, the Treasurer of the time, who is now the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), said that the sales tax system was old and archaic and it was time for it to be changed. It is a pity he was not successful in his own Caucus and party room in bringing that forward and giving us a goods and services tax instead of the sales tax because it would have saved us a lot of work today in dealing with this mishmash of sales tax legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sales tax was introduced into Australia 60 years ago, in the 1930s, in the time of the Depression, as a temporary tax on luxuries. One can see what it has grown into now. What is more, can anyone say that the luxuries of the 1930s are the luxuries of today? I do not think that anything now can be regarded as the luxury it was in the 1930s. Women's jewellery would have been a luxury in the 1930s but it certainly is not now; it is just part of everyday life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what the sales tax system has grown into. It is absolutely hopeless to administer. It is absolutely hopeless to work with for anyone in business, as I am. For example, to go back to the luxuries under the temporary system that was brought in in the 1930s, a car would have been a luxury in 1930, but does anyone in this chamber now say that a car is a luxury? Perhaps the Government has defined anything over $43,736.56 as a luxury because one might not need quite that sort of car and it has its own sales tax regime and depreciation treatment. A car is definitely not a luxury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, Australia has a foreign debt of $165 billion, give or take a few billion dollars. One can never get a straight answer out of this Government on anything, let alone on what the foreign debt is. One would think that, in such a position, the Government would be looking at internal costs for farmers, miners, small businessmen and big businessmen and putting Australians in a position where we can compete with the rest of the world. The only way the Government is going to cut down that foreign debt is by making us competitive. But the Government and its Ministers have put more and more impediments in the way of business, and that has been the ruination of business in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for those on the other side to bring Bills like this forward; they do not have to administer them themselves. The Australian Taxation Office administers them. None of those opposite would know where there is sales tax and where there is not half the time, and yet they sit in judgment. To my knowledge, no-one over there&mdash;except perhaps Senator Walsh&mdash;has ever paid a pay-packet out in his life. I will give Senator Walsh the benefit of the doubt. But they sit here in judgment and tell us what business must do and must not do for ever and ever. Business is paying to be a tax collector for the Government. That is why the Hewson GST package is far in front and is far simpler. There will be one form once a month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the Bill, which is causing nothing but hardship for Australia. This foreign debt that we have created and cannot do anything about reducing flows through to all people. This is not only to business people, it flows through to the interest rates that people pay on their homes. It most definitely penalises the one group that I have already mentioned and that is the exporters of Australia&mdash;the farmers, the miners, the business people, the manufacturers. They are the ones who are copping it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would be looking to the Government to lessen the pool of unemployment; it is one million at present and rising fast. We have had a bit of a comeback of 0.1 per cent in the last month, but that has mainly come about not by anything this Government has done, but by the fact that some of those school leavers of last year have been absorbed. Of course, in another three-odd months we will have another set of school leavers that this Government will have to worry about and unemployment will probably hit 13 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sort of legislation&mdash;the sales tax system&mdash;just penalises and it penalises those who have a chance of employing people. Instead of bringing in this sort of reform&mdash;and it is not reform judging by the mishmash we have here&mdash;the Government should be looking at abolishing sales tax lock, stock and barrel and starting again with a GST. It has been called a simplification, but it is far beyond a simplification and I will go back into that. Incidentally, Madam Acting Deputy President, you yourself put out a good paper on this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was admitted by a tax expert from our Taxation Office that it took him three days to read this jolly Bill, let alone understand it. It took three days! And that is documented in public evidence for everyone to see; do not just take my word. So if there is an expert with the Australian Taxation Office who takes three days simply to read the thing, how can a businessman, or even a businessman's qualified financial adviser, his accountant, be expected to understand it, let alone the small shopkeeper and the small farmer. There are 1,500 pages. I have not read it completely and I do not think there is anyone, including the Government's advisers, who have read the damn thing through themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is back to the 1930s. I remember Mr John Howard in the other place advocating a goods and services tax in about 1980 and he got flogged to death. They said that he was going back to the 1960s and the 1930s. How right he was. We have a Bill of massive proportions that takes three days for an officer of the Tax Office to read and it was run through the House of Representatives in 37 minutes, or something like that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a retrograde and ridiculous situation where an extra 250,000 registrations will be needed for the collection of this tax or to be exempt from this sort of tax. It is completely hopeless. The President of the Tax Institute of Australia, Ian Langford-Brown, has called on the Federal Government to scrap the current wholesale sales tax (WST) in favour of the broadly based GST. He is one person who has obviously studied it over a considerable time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are small examples of where sales tax will now apply where it did not before. The pet food industry and pet breeders are very small industries but they will cop an extra $3m. Read it for yourself, Madam Acting Deputy President. Plastic and rubber sheeting is now not exempt except in certain circumstances. As one who is involved in the building industry&mdash;not largely; probably a building a year&mdash;I have not been able to find out whether plastic sheeting is exempt when it is put under concrete. Of course, more sales tax will be taken off miners and farmers. Retailers who have goods produced by contract manufacturers will pay more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage, some of my comments may not be valid any more because the Government did back down at the last moment. But we cannot find out exactly where the Government has backed down and where it has not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contractors to government bodies will pay more. Perhaps that is based on the ruse that maybe the private contractors on other jobs can compete more fairly; I do not know. But under this Bill they will pay more. Consumers will pay more for everyday luxuries, or whatever one would like to call them, that were not covered before. There are certain things like containers for pizzas, biscuits and milkshakes. An extra $2m to $3m will be ripped out with regard to those items. There will be more sales tax on food that is used by the lower socio-economic part of the society of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is one part of the society of Australia that relies on fast food outlets it is the unemployed, who cannot afford anything else, and the Aborigines.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Government, food is not taxed. That is a big lie. Once, when printing a catalogue, only the printing was taxed, but we now have more tax on that. Now the whole lot&mdash;models, photography, lay-out, design, typesetting and film advertising&mdash;will be subject to tax. What is the Government's answer in this case? It will allow exemptions of up to $10,000 for small business. But the Government is not exempting small business from anything; it is just shifting the load somewhere else. It is shifting the goalposts, if you like. The burden of collection is shifted elsewhere. After all, when that measure was brought in it was regarded as a smokescreen to take attention away from the goods and services tax, but that tax would have been a far lot easier to administer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If these small businesses that have been exempted up to $10,000 supply to a bigger chain that is operating over $10,000 then the big chain has to make it up.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another change in small specifics. On swimming pools there will be a difference in tax depending on whether the pool is made of fibreglass or is built into the ground in concrete. That, once again, comes from my experience in the building game. Why is that? The purpose or use of a swimming pool is exactly the same whether it is made of fibreglass and lifted in with a crane or whether it is built into the ground of any other material.  The intent and purpose are exactly the same, yet there is a variation on the amount of sales tax paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This mishmash was rammed through the House of Representatives in, I think, 37 minutes&mdash;do not hold me to the number of seconds&mdash;and then it landed in this place. We were supposed to deal with this legislation before we went home for Christmas. But fortunately, due to Senator Short's work, ably helped by the Democrats, there was an inquiry. But then the inquiry itself was thrown into confusion by the Government announcing some changes at the last minute. We got the report of the inquiry on our desks yesterday. We have not had time to absorb it, let alone get the response from the Government on the inquiry's findings. The way it has been rushed through is an absolute sham. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990-91, the Government announced that it would undertake a review aimed at `simplifying' the sales tax legislation. Senator Short has already gone into the reasons why it is anything but simple. We now have before us the so-called simplification Bills. From what I read, the Committee advertised and, in no time, it had received 150 submissions from all over Australia. The Committee then found out that it was anything but simple. According to the ministerial second reading speech in the House of Representatives, the main features of the legislation are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. a significant reduction in the number of persons</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">  required to pay sales tax;</PARA>
<PARA>That is a complete lie. It shifts the burden, not the numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. a complete restructuring and redrafting of the WST legislation, in plain English, to make it simpler to use and more certain in its application;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. a streamlining of the system for acquiring business inputs and other conditionally exempt goods free of tax; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. a significant strengthening of the anti-avoidance provisions of the law.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Short has already told you about that sort of strengthening. A reading of these highlighted features would suggest that the simplification process was primarily concerned with the mechanics of the sales tax system, rather than the change to the tax base or the tax treatment of various goods and business operations. It is now apparent that this was not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed legislation includes clear policy changes, and we were told it was a simplification. The areas involved include external costs and leases. What a shemozzle came out of the leasing system. Another area is goods donated, or charities. From what I saw in the press release put out by the Minister, charities have now been exempted. My office received about 133 letters from Western Australian charities. I thought that in this world, in this age, and in this country, we left charities alone because of the cheap work that they do for the unfortunate people in the lower socioeconomic groups. But the Government had even decided to have a crack at them, although fortunately it has changed its mind. Other areas include businesses operating as deemed manufacturers, the coverage of tax rulings&mdash;Senator Watson could probably talk for half an hour on that alone&mdash;and the treatment of untaxed goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the legislation had the result of overturning the court decision which has gone against the Commissioner of Taxation in the past. That is all under the guise of simplification. Anyhow, there has been a big backdown, but there is a long way to go in backdowns yet. It will not be a backdown until it is completely thrown out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go into a few specifics with regard to primary industry, which is the industry I am most interested in. Take machinery dealers&mdash;that is, machinery dealers in a country town. For example, take the average John Deere, Massey Ferguson or John Holland dealer&mdash;whatever dealers there are around. A machine would be put onto the showroom floor from the distributor, say in this case it was John Deere. The machine would be put on the dealer's floor. Normally it was sales tax free while it was sitting on the floor. If it was bought by a farmer who was exempt, then the</PARA>
<PARA>sales tax would never have been paid because under the original Bill the machine was exempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the proposed legislation, which is now changed but not changed enough&mdash;as it is, it was rushed through the House of Representatives in 37 minutes&mdash;the dealer putting it on the floor, who has all the other costs of financing it and paying interest, would have had to put the sales tax up then. If he sold it to a farmer who was exempt, he would have then been reimbursed. Madam Acting Deputy President, even you, as a solicitor in the city of Adelaide, far removed from the agricultural sector&mdash;or I think you are&mdash;would know that a combine harvester would not be used for anything else except taking a crop off, which is an agricultural pursuit. Yet in this case, this Government was attempting to put the sales tax on first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government is always on about bringing in money through the door&mdash;the cash flow system, then maybe it has to go back later on. In this case of agricultural equipment, it always had to go back. Take, say, a simple new Holland header at $200,000, with 20 per cent sales tax of $40,000. That dealer would have had to put up finance for, say, six months&mdash;if he is lucky to sell it in the first season. There is six months on that at 10 per cent; honourable senators can work it out for themselves. That would be what that dealer had to borrow and pay to the Federal Government for its own programs and then, later on, it would have been refunded. But what would not have been refunded is the interest. Whether or not that fellow made a payment to the bank to put the machine on his show floor or had forgone interest if he had to finance it himself&mdash;I doubt that most of those dealers can afford that sort of thing&mdash;he would have had to put it up. He would not have got that back from the Commissioner of Taxation. He would have got the sales tax back, but not the interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, as I said before, it is still an impost on production. The dealer's combine header is probably sitting on the floor; he could have a four-wheel drive at $150,000 sitting on the floor; he probably has a two-wheel drive at $80,000; he would normally have a hay baler at $40,000-odd to make up a reasonable show floor; and maybe a utility as well that will still be sales tax free at the end. So it does not take much to have $1m worth of stock on the floor. That, of course, would have represented $200,000 sitting in the sales tax department awaiting reimbursement, as agricultural machinery will always be tax exempt. I could forgive that if it was something that may or may not be exempt at the end. But in that case, I cannot. I understand from the Government backdown that that will not now happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is up to the Commissioner's discretion, however&mdash;it is not written in the legislation&mdash;that while machinery is sitting on the showroom floor it will be exempt until its final position is settled one way or another. Although agricultural machinery is always agricultural machinery, it is still up to the Commissioner's discretion. How many commissioners will we get in Australia? What is more, how many have we now got in each State? In Perth, the Tax Office has split into two; one part has gone north and one has gone south. People do not know what office they belong to. Have they got a commissioner within reach? Is a ruling by one the same as a ruling by another? That is what worries me about this legislation. Even though the Government has backed down, there is too much at the Commissioner's discretion rather than being set in legislation so that people can read the legislation in plain English and then work out their business around it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even with the back-down that has occurred, there is still the same problem when parts are put onto the shelf and are then sold to exempt users. Some may not be exempt, but it is up to the one that is buying to declare whether he is exempt or not. In the original legislation it was going to be treated the same. A part went onto the floor, went into a part bin and the sales tax had to be put up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the present legislation, I was told yesterday by the machinery dealers of Australia&mdash;and I have not had any direction to the contrary&mdash;once those parts are there, even though the sales tax is not paid by that dealer under the changes we have made, if a part is needed to repair a machine that is under warranty and that has been bought under sales tax exemption, that part must have its own order number, its own purchase invoice, its own invoice, and be sold to the farmer on invoice. If that is correct, it causes a lot of headaches. Not only does it cause headaches but, if a person has to bring in a special part for that, he could lose two, three, four or five days work. He could have one part sitting on the bench and yet another one would have to come from the United States. If the Machinery Dealers Association of Australia is correct on that matter, the Government had better do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another specific matter that I would like to talk about is vehicles in agriculture. At page 7 of the explanatory memorandum for the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Bill 1992, under the heading `Vehicles for use in agricultural industry', it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be an exemption for certain kinds of vehicles that are used in agricultural industry. The exemption will not include certain trucks.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what I mean by changes in rulings. There was a ruling made some time ago that a tandem drive&mdash;say, a six-wheel truck&mdash;was regarded as a four-wheel drive. After all, what is a four-wheel drive? I think it is a vehicle that is driven by four wheels. A ruling came out a couple of years ago that that was sales tax exempt if used in certain ways on a farm, but now that is specifically overturned by this legislation. Can anyone tell me why four driving wheels should be treated differently, tax-wise, according to whether two wheels are at the front and two at the back rather than the whole four being down the back, with two extra at the front to balance the machine? I have not been able to get an answer as to why it is treated differently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the reason this ruling was overturned by the legislation and the classification was changed is that all wheels had to drive to be sales tax exempt, why are six by sixes not mentioned in the legislation? Six by six is four wheels driving at the back and two at the front, as used in forestry and in farming for taking seed and super to the paddock. I do not know whether such vehicles would be exempt. I have tried to find out but I have not got an answer. Can someone tell me that? I could go on with those sorts of things, to which I have not got answers. I believe the whole legislation adds up to far more queries and questions than ever it was meant to simplify. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe, after all that, that if this Government wants to do anything about sales tax it has to start all over again. I believe that, rather than simplification, it set out to broaden the base. I ask: broaden the base of what? Not less for more and enough for the others; no, just to get more in. The financial impact tells us that. In conclusion, as Senator Short said, we will be opposing the legislation, and in government we will certainly be doing a lot more about it than that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The six Sales Tax Bills that are currently before the Senate were designed to simplify and improve the current wholesale sales tax system. This was indeed a very laudable objective. Unfortunately, the process has gone wrong. While I am not privy to some of the reasons, there is a lot of confusion out there so far as sales tax payers are concerned at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, it does appear that the issue at the last minute was rushed and, as a consequence, there were a large number of unintended consequences. The problems created are reflected in something like 140 submissions that were presented to the Select Committee on Sales Tax Legislation. Perhaps there were an equal number of letters, protests, phone calls and so on. Despite the Government's revisions&mdash;they are substantial, and we thank it for them&mdash;the question before the chamber at the moment is: will this legislation still achieve its basic objective of simplification? While the thrust is right and the direction is right and there have been quite a lot of amendments, there is still a lot of confusion about some intermediate situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to say that the review process, short as it was&mdash;and it was far too short&mdash;was a very necessary one and, I think, quite clearly demonstrates to the Australian people the value of a second chamber and the value of the process that we have here of referring Bills to a committee. Had these Bills not gone to the Committee, there would have been enormous additional problems because it would have taken a lot longer to expose some of the difficulties and to have had them rectified. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) announced, and we now have before us, a series of amendments to the amendments which reflect a revision of policy, but there are still approximately over 1,000 pages of new legislation and explanatory material and the law is still expected to come into effect on 1 December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give an example. It is fairly clear that charities will no longer be taxed in the three areas that were previously not intended to be taxed, and I think the Government has reasonably satisfactorily addressed five or six of the areas which were the focus of most of the attention of the submissions. But there are, I must say, a whole lot of intermediate areas. For example, there is still a dilemma in the minds of the natural gas industry, particularly that sector of the industry which uses natural gas vehicles. Let me explain by way of example: since 1985 compressors and associated equipment forming an essential part of a natural gas vehicle refuelling system had been exempted from sales tax. The industry is still uncertain about its position at the present time, despite the changes. This is what I say is unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990, home refuelling appliances, small compressors, were also granted an exemption. That was very satisfactory, but under the proposed sales tax simplification legislation the exemption would be removed and a 20 per cent sales tax would apply. In the event of this change, the whole natural gas vehicle fuel program throughout Australia would naturally be under threat. This additional and totally unexpected impost, without reference to the industry, would mean that the already marginal economics of natural gas as a vehicle fuel would become untenable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This uncertainty has not been fully addressed. Because of the pressure to go through the whole raft of amendments&mdash;I have had the amendments for only about 36 hours&mdash;I put it to the Government that the problem in this good industry is that we have an abundance of natural gas and we are going to tax it out of existence, which would be unfortunate, but I believe that the problem could be overcome by a simple amendment. I hope the advisers will take note of it, because we cannot afford to lose industries unnecessarily at this critical time of deep recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the decision could be reversed by amending proposed item 172 to include the following words: goods for use in the preparation and use of natural gas as a fuel, internal combustion engines, parts, accessories, attachments and fittings. This simple change would mean a continuation of the natural gas vehicle fuel program through Australia. I therefore ask the Government whether it can institute the amendment to reverse what has been an apparent anomaly and, I hope, an unintended consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That clearly demonstrates the intermediate dilemma in which a lot of industries now find themselves. These amendments to the amendments should have gone back to the Select Committee for further evaluation, further contact with the industry and further input. Then there would have been a lot more certainty. Sales tax, unlike income tax, is a transactions tax. It is paid up front. Technically it is possible to get one's money back but it is very embarrassing and very difficult and it is not good for customer-client relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will now be six Acts in lieu of the previous 27 sales tax Acts. That is welcome. In fact, the new sales tax law has been completely rewritten in a different style, with substantial changes in terminology. The thrust is very important. However, the Bill does nothing to overcome the inherent defects of imposing taxes at the wholesale sales tax level when nowadays that step in the distribution chain is rapidly disappearing. Also, the charges would add significantly to industry's input costs, quite unlike the coalition's Fightback policy, which is designed to remove such business charges as business input costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that sales tax is inflationary. It adds to the cost of living. It is a hidden tax. The consumers do not know what tax is in the price they are paying. In the past eight years, the total revenue to Government has grown significantly from just less than $4 billion to just over $9 billion at the present time, and it is about to jump again under the new measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of problems, but I acknowledge that perhaps the most blatant difficulties with the earlier sales tax simplification legislation have been attended to following Mr Dawkins's hasty revision. We thank him for that and we acknowledge the important role played by Senator Short and Senator Vanstone on the Committee and others in drawing attention to the problems that were created by this legislation. As a result of this change, there is another big problem that we must address if we are to have any pride in Australia as a nation. We have to encourage Australian ownership in industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original simplification legislation would have overcome a problem within the oil industry but, in overcoming that problem, it would have addressed a discrimination that operated against all companies that unfortunately had, by their structure, an Australian shareholding. I refer to Ampol and to Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original sales tax legislation, as a result of the removal of the deemed manufacturer provisions, would have overcome that inequity. When the Government decided to reinstate, for very good reason, the deemed manufacturer provisions, it recreated a problem for the industry in that there was an anomaly. There was not a level playing field. As a result of this anomaly, the oil refineries that were affected were the companies that had an Australian shareholding content. I think this was, indeed, unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One may say that they should restructure their activities to overcome the particular problems. But the question has to be asked: why should oil companies that are efficient worldwide restructure their operations simply because of the whims of governments in the way they structure their sales tax? The cost involved in restructuring to take advantage of the concession now, along the lines of the competitors, really cannot be easily quantified. In any event, there is no guarantee that the anti-avoidance provisions of the law would accommodate such actions because that is the way the legislation is written. That is unfortunate. It is difficult to restructure because the dominant purpose of restructuring is to overcome the sales tax problem, which is technically running into the problems with the anti-avoidance provisions of the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation currently excludes investment when used in conjunction with refinery exchange arrangements, even though refinery exchange is for all intents a part of the manufacturing operation. Briefly, to avoid creating a multitude of small, inefficient refineries in Australia&mdash;and this is basically what the Government is expecting the industry to do&mdash;each company manufactures products at one or two locations sufficient for its overall needs. It exchanges part of these volumes for products from its competitors' refineries interstate to satisfy markets remote from its manufacturing location. The practice of refinery exchange appears to be unique to the oil industry. Because it is a highly volatile fuel, about 5 to 10 per cent is lost through evaporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To exclude refinery exchange based investment from the manufacturing concession is anomalous, and it sends a signal to the market from the Government that efficient world scale manufacturing operations are actually not encouraged. I am sure that this should not be an intention of any government. But it is my job, I believe, to focus on a few of these problems at the moment. I put it to the Government that it must address these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An industry specific provision should be introduced; that is the way out. The specific amendment should be limited to those companies which are part of the group which itself manufactures petroleum products in Australia. If this proves impracticable, it should not be beyond the legislative drafters to come up with a solution to remove the inequity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at one particular case. In 1992-93 Ampol, for example, proposes to commit over $140m of new capital expenditure, the large majority being facilities fabricated and constructed in Australia, a not insignificant proportion of which may now be subject to sales taxes excluded from the concessions. This is surely an unintended consequence. The companies proceeded on the basis that the law was going to be changed with the removal of the deemed manufacturer provisions. They were right. But at least it put them on a level playing field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The oil industry is highly regulated, to the stage where the Prices Surveillance Authority controls the wholesale price which the industry is able to charge for its petrol. Therefore, any additional legislation, such as the sales tax simplification legislation as now amended, will cause problems of inequity. Surely, the purpose of simplification was to remove the industry. It is unique in its operation and it is at an essential time, and I think it important that we address this matter, because I feel that discrimination against companies that have an Australian shareholding content is quite abhorrent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic intention of the legislation was to stimulate manufacturing investment and to make industry competitive by reducing the incidence of sales tax on business inputs. We have a problem of inequity here, so far as the Australian companies are concerned. The refiner-marketer could be a deemed manufacturer. This would mean that storage, handling and distribution facilities would be exempt and this would be clearly in line with government policy. But the policy changes affect the five refiner-marketers unequally. That is caused, it is true, by their corporate structures, which have developed differently over the years. Consequently, three organisations are now able to obtain a substantial benefit while two&mdash;the two which have Australian content&mdash;cannot. Because the deemed manufacturer provisions have now been excluded from the proposed simplification of legislation they will perpetuate a previous inequity, and we have told the Government how it should overcome the particular concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now direct some attention to some of the amendments: firstly, the general anti-avoidance provisions. Fortunately, the proposals originally put to this Senate have now been changed and a number of conditions which the Commissioner must satisfy before the provisions can be applied have got to be examined. But a notable omission from these revised amendments is what I refer to as the safe-harbour provision for ordinary commercial dealings. Without this, there will be a great deal of confusion from this new legislation. In other words, despite all the words, the principal failing of the old provision would appear to be mirrored in the new provision. The provision could be even worse than this in the proposed section 93(2) as expressed in the comprehensive terms, and might preclude the Commissioner from having regard to the matters not expressed therein. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there are difficulties even with the revised general anti-avoidance provisions. It is true the draconian earlier content&mdash;some of it&mdash;has been withdrawn and revised, particularly the Commissioner's powers of reconstruction, but I put it to the Government that it should address this question of this notable omission in relation to a safe harbour for ordinary commercial dealings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The untaxed goods provisions, as foreshadowed, are not to be extended to those untaxed because of the small business exemption, and the proposed amendment does now appear to fully accommodate most concerns. Under the original simplified law, donations to exempt bodies&mdash;for example, goods which were donated to a charity which were to be used in a raffle or sold for the purpose of making money&mdash;did not qualify for the exemption. This was drawn to their attention; it has now been addressed. A new item, 193, is to be introduced to provide for an exemption of goods for donation or loan to an always exempt person and we welcome that. That was certainly an unintended consequence and caused unnecessary fear across the business community. In the case of property owned or leased to exempt organisations, the scope of the proposed amendments appears to be much more limited than was indicated in the Treasurer's press release of 11 August. Examples of the types of things not covered as intended are perhaps much more limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to short term leases: a number of new provisions are to be incorporated in the sales tax laws to provide a proportional sales tax exemption for goods which are subject to an eligible short term lease. A new provision, 15A, will set out the conditions under which the Commissioner may enter into an agreement to calculate a rebate percentage with a taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that there is still one minor problem with the proposed amendment. The Taxation Office has agreed on record that the agreements to be made under the new section 15 will mirror the agreements which taxpayers will certainly have with the Taxation Office. I think it is questionable whether the words of section 15A will really facilitate such agreements. For example, most current agreements are based on revenues rather than, for example, leasing periods under this context of short term leases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We thank the Government for the further revision in relation to goods used to repair exempt goods, because that proposed amendment does appear to cover adequately the new arrangements. Similarly, the deemed manufacturer provisions do appear to be in line with the Treasurer's press release. However, the requirement for wholesale sales will pose problems in the future as some businesses will tend to retail more and more. For example, magazine publishers will be marketing more and more by subscription and by direct mail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of sale of goods subject to approval, a new provision, section 15B, is to be incorporated into the Sales Tax Assessment Act to cover the circumstances where a person makes a loan on trial or lease of goods with the intention of subsequently selling or leasing goods to the user. The provision is aimed at situations where the goods are subject or sold subject to a trial or approved period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Government has seen fit to make a number of complicated changes to the simplified sales tax Bills&mdash;that is, I suppose, a contradiction in itself&mdash;the changes do not address all the issues raised before the Senate Select Committee. Therefore, I put it to you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that the best course is for the Government to put these issues, these further amendments and these outstanding issues, back to the Committee for a proper evaluation, because if ever there was a need for certainty in the law it is paramount in the area of sales tax. I put it to the Committee that some of those areas that do need to be looked at are the general anti-avoidance provisions, particularly the areas that I addressed earlier, and property owned or leased to exempt organisations. The provisions go only part of the way to satisfying the Treasurer's press release and certain of his concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the issues and the substance raised before the Committee have not been addressed. There is still a lot of uncertainty in the area of rulings. This is unfortunate. I refer to containers for takeaway foods: there is now a discrimination within the food industry. McDonald's and similar takeaway food outlets will be discriminated against. The original intent under sales tax law was that the containers have the same rate of sales tax that applies to the products that the containers enclose. A simplification process would have endorsed that concept. But no, we have a change whereby there is a discrimination and, instead of simplifying the area, the Government has added further confusion and is going to get extra revenue from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an anomaly with regard to the terminals used by authors and the typesetting of commercial publications. This is an area that I would have thought would have been addressed at the time. There is also the issue of equipment used by airline catering establishments. There is a confusion in the explanatory memorandum at page 136. That could be a trap for unsuspecting taxpayers. It would be fairly difficult for people making rulings within the Tax Office to perceive that perhaps there are reasons to ignore the words `no change'. So there are a number of difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there are still many defects in the legislation, the thrust of the Government's intention was needed. Unfortunately, it appears that in the end the officers who were responsible were asked to come up with a solution, despite a two-year long term evaluation, and with a hasty answer. We have lost a lot of the benefits in the process of that research. Had they been given additional time, perhaps another three months or six months, it would have provided them with the opportunity to put these new proposals to industry for evaluation and to have presented to this Parliament in the first place a comprehensive simplification proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not really the fault of those concerned, or of the Tax Office, which carried out its job in a very professional and very helpful manner. The responsibility must surely be sheeted home to the Government. It forced this dreadful timetable on both the Tax Office&mdash;those officers who were advising&mdash;and on this Parliament. I think it is unfortunate that the commencement date is 1 December. It is too early, given the significance of the change and the ramifications that the sales tax is going to have on industry. Given the fact that the Opposition has highlighted an entirely different approach&mdash;the Fightback approach, and a GST, which will certainly address all the issues about which we have major concerns&mdash;the Government should at least go back and have a thorough look at the question of rulings, the anti-avoidance provisions, the dilemmas that typesetters are faced with in the printing industry, the problems within the food industry, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a lot of annoyed people out there, people who will feel that they are being disadvantaged. People who felt that their problems were going to be overcome by the legislation will find themselves like a shag on a rock. In the case of those Australian oil refineries that have an Australian shareholding content, I think it is absolutely atrocious that any Government should allow, for any period of time, such companies, particularly as at least one of them is investing large sums of money, to be discriminated against in such an unsatisfactory way. I look forward to further debate on this matter when the Senate Select Committee on Sales Tax Legislation presents its report later in the day. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true, as I said, that a heavy responsibility falls on the Australian Democrats in relation to this. It is not as though they are opposed to indirect taxes. We have certainly seen that from the alternative Budget which Senator Kernot presented to the Australian people some weeks ago. It was strangely called, I would have to say, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Getting to Work</EMPHASIS>. Nonetheless, in that document Senator Kernot set out what she believed to be proposals that should be put before the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a number of occasions I have drawn attention to the former alternative Budget that was the vision presented by Senator Spindler. I used to come into this chamber to attack his proposals. Essentially, Senator Spindler felt that the Australian people should have another $6.4 billion of taxes imposed on them. I suspect that I reflect the feelings of the Australian community in saying that the last thing we need is more taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot's so-called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Getting to Work </EMPHASIS>document actually trumps Senator Spindler. She believes that taxes should be raised by about $7.2 billion on top of the already heavy burden of taxes that the Australian people are now paying. I am most grateful to Senator Lees for drawing my attention to that. I did mark that statement in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Getting to Work </EMPHASIS>document, because there is no secret that the Australian Democrats believe that Australians are undertaxed. There is no secret about that. In fact, Senator Lees is quite open in saying, at page 14 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Getting to Work</EMPHASIS>, that Australia, with the United States, has the second lowest level of taxation of OECD countries. So Senator Lees does believe that the Australian people are lowly taxed. This feature is highlighted in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Getting to Work</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the Australian Democrats want to impose a whole range of new taxes on the Australian people. They want, for example, to increase the income tax. The so-called jobs levy is, in effect, an increased income tax which will hit most families in this country. They believe in a fossil fuel levy which will hit just about every person who uses a power point, every factory that needs to rely on energy. It is a very heavy tax and a very heavy burden which will flow through to the costs of virtually everything produced in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees and her colleagues have proposed higher petrol taxes, in direct contrast to the sorts of proposals that are included in the Fightback program, which aims to cut the overall burden of petrol taxes by about $11 per tank of petrol. We also have proposals to lift the company tax rate, which I guess is a strange proposal in a period when we are actually trying to encourage companies to make profits to put on jobs! The response of the Australian Democrats is to increase company taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be said that the Democrats have a responsibility to look at their policies, which I believe are an invitation to the Labor Government to lift taxes in various areas. That is why I tend to feature those quite prominently in debates in this chamber. It is not as though the Democrats are ever going to be able to put through these taxes but the Labor Party, with its high spending program, is always sorely tempted to find new areas of revenue, to find taxes. The Democrat policies on taxation are an invitation to the Labor Party to bring in more taxes. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know what the Labor Party would have to do, because basically the Tax Office is fully in favour of a goods and services tax. We know that. Indeed, a number of Treasury officers have gone overseas to examine what has happened in Canada with a goods and services tax; and we know the sort of advice that is coming up. We know that the Treasury has installed a massive computer program to model goods and services taxes. We know that. But let me tell Senator Collins the overriding reason why the Labor Party will be bringing in a goods and services tax. The overriding reason is that, basically, the Labor Party is faced with a massive and exploding Budget deficit. In one of the rare bursts of honesty&mdash;we have to say this&mdash;Mr Dawkins indicated that, down the track, the Labor Party has got to find some more money. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One concern that has been drawn to my attention by a number of constituents which is worth bringing before this chamber is that the legislation we have before us will render virtually useless all existing rulings held by taxpayers as well as related case law. There is no doubt in my mind that the Bills before the Senate are complex. That was probably best shown by the inability of the Australian Taxation Office to provide quick answers to questions asked during the Select Committee hearings. Because of this complexity, taxpayers will have to seek rulings from the Tax Office to see whether they have incurred a tax liability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation even contains a provision to protect taxpayers from having to pay back taxes if the ruling happens to be incorrect. But the sting is that such private rulings will give protection only to those people to whom they are issued. This will leave other companies and businesses further down the chain exposed to uncertainty and potential tax claims. An example is a manufacturer who gains a ruling relating to the classification of his product. The manufacturer then sells the product to wholesalers and it is on-sold to retailers. I understand that the problem is that the ruling applies only to the manufacturer. If the ruling is found to be wrong or is reversed, only the manufacturer will be compensated. Customers who acted in good faith would then be liable for the tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way to avoid this problem is for each actor in the chain to seek an individual ruling. That means that the only way to guarantee commercial certainty is by going to the time and expense of seeking rulings from the Australian Tax Office. Not only will this so-called simplification add to business complexity and costs but it will bog down the Australian Taxation Office in a morass of individuals seeking rulings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An issue which has been raised in the media and which, I understand, still has not been satisfactorily resolved in the amendments that the Government has brought forward is the amendments that relate to retailers such as jewellers and marketers of photographic equipment who currently sell goods tax free to Australians going overseas and to international tourists in Australia. I understand that the proposed amendments will be extremely costly and cumbersome and will cause problems for retailers and customers. Under this Bill, it will be much cheaper for all tourists to purchase their duty free goods outside Australia.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the chamber's attention to this statement by the Executive Director of the Jewellers Association of Australia, Ms Kim Hillard:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed procedures were so cumbersome as to effectively mean that tax free sales to Australians travelling overseas would no longer be possible.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that the legislation before us will cause major problems in this particular sector, in addition to the other sectors to which Senator Watson and my other colleagues have drawn attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One aspect of the new Bills which has the prospect of costing much more is that of dual usage. Certainly where goods are used both by an exempt organisation and by a taxable organisation, exemption applies to those goods. For example, certain goods relating to the Sydney Harbour Tunnel project are exempt even though they are owned by private contractors. The Bills will ensure that an exemption will apply only where goods are leased or purchased by the exempt organisation. I understand from accountants that this provision will jeopardise many joint private sector and public sector projects and add costs to many organisations that rely on public funding. So much for the Keating Government's policy to involve the private sector in infrastructure projects!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One way to judge the worth of this legislation is to see how it matches the intent of the Government. The Treasurer, Mr Dawkins,in his press release outlining the simplification of the wholesale sales tax legislation, referred to the benefits of the simplified law. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new law will reduce the cost of administering and complying with the WST. The extension of the small business concession is a major initiative to reduce business compliance costs and will lead to a more efficient and effective indirect tax system.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe I have just illustrated how false these statements are and how poorly the Treasurer understands the issue of taxation reform. Even by the Government's own standards, this Bill is a failure before it has been enacted.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the comments made by my colleagues about the Sales Tax Assessment Bill 1992 and related Bills that we now have before us. We are told that the Bills have been introduced to simplify sales tax. But unfortunately, they have created more confusion. During my speech I will develop some aspects of this confusion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also declare, as Senator Panizza did, that as a primary producer I have a vital interest in this legislation for a variety of reasons. The first reason&mdash;certainly not the least important&mdash;is that in a taxation system there must be equity between and within industries. This measure has been touted as simplification, but it exacerbates that lack of equity between and within industries. I will also develop that point in a moment or two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Confusion has arisen about this legislation. I wish to develop what has been put before me, mainly by the Tractor and Machinery Association of Australia, and by primary producers, particularly farmers and pastoralists, and by miners. I have not yet been able to determine, from my examination of the amendments before us, whether the concerns of the Tractor and Machinery Association of Australia have been addressed. From what I have read of the amendments, those concerns have not been totally addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the unintended consequences of this legislation on the various machinery dealers and suppliers of goods and services, particularly to rural areas, will be that the actual cost of operating each item purchased will be greater than the sales tax. As a result, sales tax will be collected by default. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am cynical and suspicious enough to believe that the legislation has been designed in such a way as to increase the tax base while increasing the cost to the people in rural and regional Australia who supply those goods and services. These people are finding it very difficult to survive. For example, last week a local machinery dealer at Ravensthorpe told me that 60 per cent of the items that he sells have a value of $10 or less. The cost of administering the proposals before us will do nothing more than significantly increase the cost of those products beyond what the tax exemption is worth. Of course, the final user of the product will pick up the costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than the Bills simplifying sales tax and making it easier for people involved in those industries&mdash;whether in the wheat, wool or beef industries; mining, particularly prospecting; or any arm of the agricultural or mining industries&mdash;most of the tax will be collected by default. In the long run, this not being a simple or cost-effective operation will mean that our ability to compete, in an export sense, will be severely disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make reference to the haste with which this Bill, even though there has been some two years review in the development of it, was guillotined through the House of Representatives. The intention was to have it passed through this place before the winter recess. Fortunately, that did not occur. While one can be critical of the Democrats at times, one must also acknowledge that they did support us in having the legislation referred to a Senate select committee, although the way that the Committee was treated was most unsatisfactory. To have two days of hearings into what are essentially changes to 27 Bills, which was reduced to six Bills, to look at the various submissions&mdash;I believe there were around 150&mdash;and do justice to them in that time is certainly not satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to some of the comments in the report which I found interesting. The first comes from Coopers and Lybrand. I think it is a very important test and one which has been mentioned in many of the submissions. I certainly have read a number of the submissions, but not all of them. The report refers to the Coopers and Lybrand submission, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As sales tax is a self-assessing tax, it is imperative that this "new law", which replaces the existing sales tax legislation, meets all the tests of a good statute, ie simplicity, equity, efficiency and certainty. In generality, in our opinion, the legislation as it presently exists, fails all four tests.</PARA>
<PARA>Even with the amendments that have been put before us, I believe it still fails those four tests, for the reasons I have mentioned, and some others which I will mention in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at comments that indicate why this legislation should not be before us today, even though it was referred to the Select Committee on Sales Tax Legislation. The Committee, chaired by Senator Walsh, said at paragraph 78:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concerns raised are discussed in the body of this report. The Committee believes that the announcements made in the Treasurer's press release of 11 August 1992&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>legislation by press release, I might add, in the middle of a hearing&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the explanations and undertakings given by the ATO in relation to matters subject to the Commissioner of Taxation's discretion, address most of those concerns. The committee accepts&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the word `accepts'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that as witnesses have not seen the proposed amendments which give effect to the undertakings in the statement they reserve their position about whether the government's undertakings would fully satisfy their concerns. The Committee shares the concerns expressed by witnesses and believes that more time should have been available to consider the effects of matters raised in the Treasurer's press release.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Committee said in its report. I quote from what Senator Short and Senator Vanstone said in their minority report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The hearings revealed that the Government's new proposed Wholesale Sales Tax would include a tax on food, a tax on services, a tax on exports, a tax on tourism, a tax on farmers, a tax on many manufacturers, double taxation, a tax on infrastructure and a tax on plant and buildings. These taxes are all the result of the fundamentally flawed Wholesale Sales Tax system, that this Government seeks to retain.</PARA>
<PARA>Their recommendations stated further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new law for Wholesale Sales Tax as envisaged in the Bills is fundamentally flawed. Sales Tax is a tax on goods. It is a tax that has a significant cascading effect, which results in tax on all sorts of goods and services, that is not intended.</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that it is not intended. They continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is paid and borne by business. It is highly uncompetitive. It means that many Australian producers are left at a substantial disadvantage to overseas competitors, both in export markets and domestically.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The so-called "simplification" process has failed to deliver a substantially better sales tax system.</PARA>
<PARA>I will dwell for a moment on the disadvantages this has for Australian producers compared to our overseas competitors and highlight the particular aspect which has been drawn out quite correctly by Senator Short and Senator Vanstone. In the recent Budget nothing was done to ease the burden that exporters in this country carry. Until that burden is eased and broken down, and exporters are allowed to operate in a taxation system that is competitive and fair compared to what occurs in the rest of the world, we will continue to be disadvantaged and this country will continue to have current account problems, Budget deficit blow-outs and a number of other consequences which are not in our long term best interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Budget states that the Government has in fact accepted that the best that it can do if its predictions are correct&mdash;and recent history and longer term history would suggest that they are not going to be correct&mdash;is find that an unemployment level of somewhere around 10 per cent is acceptable. One cannot come to any other conclusion but that. Until such time as we have a taxation system which does not disadvantage our capacity to be competitive in an export sense, we will continue to have the sorts of problems that I have outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will move to the minority report by Senator Kernot from the Democrats. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are still a number of anomalies which apply in the Wholesale Sales Tax.</PARA>
<PARA>The report from the Committee as a whole, the minority report from Opposition senators and the minority report from the Democrats, represented by Senator Kernot, all justify in a very succinct way the fact that this legislation should be referred back to that Senate Select Committee for proper and full examination of the anomalies and the things that many of the witnesses raised, if this Government at this time is going to continue down the road of a wholesale sales tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also support very strongly the comments of my colleague Senator Kemp when he emphasised very strongly that if by some misfortune or injustice the Keating Government was to get back into power&mdash;which I do not believe it will&mdash;this legislation would be the forerunner of a goods and services tax by the Government. Many aspects that have been brought under the wholesale sales tax revision in this Bill indicate that very strongly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just move through a number of other points that I wish to raise in terms of this particular legislation. I have already mentioned the quotes from the Committee and I have mentioned the changing of the legislation by press release which the Treasurer did, as I understand it, on the eve of the first day of the two-day hearings. This was even before he had had an opportunity to have a look at the report that was to come down from the people who gave evidence. I presume that his officers in his Department did in fact take some note of some of the submissions that were put forward, but one will never know that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us just talk for a moment about the current wholesale sales tax system and what is wrong with it. The first thing that is wrong with it is that it is a hidden tax; it is a dishonest tax. People do not know what they are paying. They do not know what the cost of the cascading effect of the tax is through the system. For that reason alone, if we had a taxation system which in fact was visible, people would be able to assess the actual tax they were paying and would be able to make a much fairer judgment on governments, whatever their colour, in terms of the amount of tax they were paying. They would also be able to make a much fairer judgment in terms of the businesses they were dealing with. They would be able to see just what mark-ups were being placed on goods and services, or goods in particular, because the service costs from a wholesale sales tax are very minimal, but they do have a cascading effect as a result of its indirect impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before: what is wrong with it? It is hidden and, as a result of being hidden, it is dishonest. There is no greater example of that than the fuel excise and the way that has crept up over the last 10 years, from somewhere in the order of 6.5c to in excess of 25c a litre without anybody having a clue what was going on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon I wish to outline to Queensland residents, that is, those whom I represent in this chamber, why I no longer carry a particular credit card which I used for 15 years. I believe my remarks are pertinent to Queensland holders of the card only, but residents of other States may wish to check whether similar circumstances prevail for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The card to which I refer is American Express, well known throughout Australia and, indeed, throughout most of the world. In fact, I can recall only one place overseas where my American Express card was not accepted. The incident occurred in an out of the way centre in Germany and with only Danish currency in my wallet I met a few difficulties in paying for dinner. The card is not universally accepted in Australia, but with an American Express card and a Bankcard I have never been unable to charge accommodation and travel costs in Australia. The principal reason for applying for a card some 15 years ago was to pay for accommodation and meals, as well as for other purchases, when overseas. I later used the American Express card for a wide variety of purchases in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have, however, not renewed my annual subscription to American Express, not because of a small additional impost charged by the company but because of a matter of principle. Whenever I make purchases in Queensland&mdash;this is where the vast majority of my card purchases occur&mdash;I am charged stamp duty on each transaction except the first. At 10c a transaction this is a relatively small amount but, if all the cards being used in Queensland were taken into account, stamp duty charges would net a reasonable amount of revenue for the Queensland Government. I have no complaint with that. I am a Queensland resident and, as I mentioned, most of my credit card charge purchases occur in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year, however, as well as paying Queensland Government stamp duty I have been billed by American Express for New South Wales financial institutions duty. Although financial institutions duty is calculated differently, the duty for which I have been billed generally equates to the amount of Queensland stamp duty payable. I have asked the company why I should pay financial institutions duty, especially when most of my purchases occur in Queensland and when my American Express account was automatically credited from one of my Queensland bank accounts. The response was that, as my payments to the company were deposited in New South Wales, the company was charged financial institutions duty on its bank deposits and has now decided to pass this charge on to its members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that, under the conditions of use of an American Express card, the company can do this rather than accept the duty as a business expense, an expense which it has incurred because it entrusts its business to a New South Wales based bank. For users of the card in Queensland, however, it means that, even if their purchases are made entirely within Queensland, they have to pay New South Wales financial institutions duty. That is in addition to their Queensland stamp duty. I see no reason why Queensland citizens should prop up an ailing New South Wales economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have subsequently obtained, through the bank with which I deal, a Queensland based credit card which allows me to make domestic and overseas purchases. I still pay the required Queensland stamp duty but not New South Wales financial institutions duty. I informed the American Express company that, when my renewal of $60 became payable, I would not renew. That non-renewal has now occurred, breaking a 15-year association I had with the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I am recounting this today is to alert other American Express card holders in Queensland that they are subsidising the New South Wales Government. They would be able to find, as I did, that there are Queensland based credit cards which offer similar services to those of American Express and quite possibly cost far less than the amount charged by American Express for its annual fee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that I have an alternative card to my former American Express card, I am pleased that I took the effort to change. I see no reason why I should pay financial institutions duty to the New South Wales Government because a company I deal with happens to choose a bank in New South Wales with which to lodge its deposits. Those Queensland residents who carry American Express cards, or any other card which has a similar policy attached, should investigate the possibility of discarding their card in favour of a Queensland based card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an interesting postscript to the story about cutting my ties with American Express. As I knew that my association with the company was coming to an end, I discontinued using the card a month or two before my membership was due to expire. Even so, I received a final account from the company, an account for 26c. That was the financial institutions duty which the company had billed me for the last account which I had paid. I had a mind to ignore the demand for 26c but formed the opinion that the company would report me to a credit reference agency, and that my credit rating would be damaged, all for the want of 26c which the company had incurred but was intent on passing on. I duly sent a cheque for 26c. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To reiterate, I suggest that Queensland credit card holders check to see whether they too are paying tax to the government of another State, as well as to the Queensland Government. If they are, they have a remedy of discontinuing the use of that card and obtaining an equally good Queensland based alternative. </PARA>

It relates to the situation of the F3 freeway between Sydney and Newcastle not being completed, but just ending in the middle of a swamp, eight kilometres from the national highway that it is meant to feed into. The F3 is 150 kilometres long. It is just sheer stupidity to build all of it, except for the last eight kilometres. It is obvious that a major road that links the largest city in Australia with the sixth largest city in Australia would have huge traffic volumes, and that is true. The F3 caters for all the northbound traffic leaving Sydney, going through northern New South Wales and on into Queensland.

The roads in his electorate will be expected to take a lot of the burden of the dispersing freeway traffic, just as they have done for the last five years when the F3 finished at a point west of Toronto&mdash;again, in the middle of nowhere and without any proper links with other major roads.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To explain more fully to honourable senators who may not be familiar with the local conditions, the F3 is a federally funded road which is part of the national road system. The plan is for a network of major roads encircling the continent. The incomplete F3 has long been a break in the link. It needs to join both the Pacific Highway and the New England Highway. These roads, of course, are the major traffic routes to Brisbane. However, the F3 is going to stop just before it gets to these highways. The two northbound lanes of the freeway are going to feed into a single local road called Lenaghans Drive, eight kilometres short of the main intersection. This means that there will be a most horrendous bottleneck in peak traffic periods; peak periods such as Christmas 1993 when the connection is due to open. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authorities building the freeway are all aware of the fact that this bottleneck will occur. The project report from the Road Traffic Authority of New South Wales in Newcastle states that the average annual daily traffic, the AADT, on Lenaghans Drive is at the moment in excess of 8,000 vehicles. This is expected to increase substantially on the opening of the next section of the freeway to Lenaghans Drive, in December 1993. Current best practice indicates that dual carriageways should be built where the AADT reaches 8,000 to 12,000. To quote the RTA:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The perception of inadequacy will be heightened for the northbound traffic coming from freeway standards to a relatively short length of two lane road with entering traffic, before re-entering further dual carriageways.</PARA>
<PARA>If the situation is going to occur and the relevant authorities know that the result will be traffic disaster, the question is: why is Mr Brown, the responsible Minister, going to let this occur?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funding is needed urgently to connect the F3 both to the New England and Pacific highways with dual carriageway so that traffic flow can be smooth, efficient and safe and ultimately at a lower cost to private and public users. The freeway was started 30 years ago, but we are still waiting for it to be finished. At the moment, one could expect that this ridiculous situation with local traffic conditions could persist for another six years. It is more likely that we will be waiting for a further 15 years. Either way, it is simply not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government has to see this for the very high priority that it is. This F3 is the link between Sydney and the rapidly growing and increasingly urbanised and very popular holiday destinations along the north coast of New South Wales. With this traffic feeding into Lenaghans Drive, the results during peak periods like Christmas and Easter will be similar to the five-hour traffic jams that resulted six years ago when the tollgates north of Sydney were still in operation. It is simply unacceptable for motorists to go back to those miserable conditions again. But this is what the Federal Government expects us to accept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national highway is a federally funded road. The route is determined by the Federal Government and, therefore, it is responsible for this plan. Last month the Minister for Land Transport announced $600m worth of road projects for high unemployment areas, but the completion of the F3, one of Australia's major roads, did not even get a look in. Even the fact that this issue is vital to the electorate of the Minister did not seem to help. This is a prime example of the ineffectiveness of ALP members of parliament in the Newcastle area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to the result of the public consultation paper being conducted next month and the environmental impact statement being conducted on the options for the link of the F3 to the New England and Pacific highways. Lenaghans Drive is, surely, not the way to go. A completed dual carriageway for the national highway is necessary. To stop the construction eight kilometres short would be a national transport tragedy. </PARA>

The significant absence of deaths in police cells is something which affords us great hope that police practices throughout Australia can be improved in such a way that tragedies, such as the death of Paul Loughlin, do not need to recur. It is for this reason that I mentioned in my notice of motion that the Senate should commend the Western Australian Government and the Western Australian Police for this response to the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. It reflects a significant indicator of improved police practice in that State. I also suggest that we should note with concern that the same indicators of improved police procedures are not present in other States. I support the memory of that young man's death, two years ago yesterday, as a need for us to look further at the implementation of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to use this opportunity to express my concerns about the income tax rulings system, in particular the taxation draft ruling known as TR92/D24. After all the excitement and the media attention of the Budget, I believe it is appropriate that we should turn our minds to the processes by which this country is really governed and to the people who are in important in that process. Because we operate here in the full glare of parliamentary publicity, we tend to be beguiled into the belief that we are actually in control, that we get the results we expect and that when we pull these exciting levers, which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) refers to, we are in control&mdash;or he is in control.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I would like to remind the Senate that what attracts the passing attention of the Press Gallery does not always represent the real and the ultimate exercise of executive power. I would like to illustrate what I mean by reference to the income tax system, particularly the rulings. We have had cause whilst sitting on various committees, particularly on the most recent example, the sales tax legislation Committee, to reflect upon how public announcements by politicians can be executed by the Public Service in ways which effectively frustrate the intentions of the Parliament. I would like to illustrate this more specifically and, I think, more powerfully by reference to the process of taxation rulings, in particular the reference to draft ruling TR92/D24 which relates to deductibility of interest expense of Australian companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a sense, the draft ruling process can be even more insidious than the slipping through Parliament of egregious legislation. I refer specifically to that word to draw attention to what is sometimes shocking or sometimes horrifying legislation, in terms of its impact. At least with the latter case we have some opportunity to grasp the fleeting moment and stall the process, as we did in the tax legislation, to allow some proper examination, and that is quite appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming back to this ruling: firstly, the ruling will, through the creation of new levels of interference, add directly to the bill which the Commissioner will present to us to administer his office in the years ahead. More importantly and insidiously, it will add to the administrative costs of many Australian corporations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it will distort the international transactions of those corporations and it will make them a great deal more difficult. In other words, what I am saying is that through this ruling the Australian Taxation Office will make life tough for Australian multinationals. It will make it difficult for them to do business. They will have to look over their shoulders all the time as they try to build up the sorts of overseas investments which this Parliament considers to be beneficial to Australia. The injection of equity capital into overseas subsidiaries, which the Tax Office seeks to penalise, is really the only way to invest in many Asian countries, given their investment rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, and more broadly, I question whether this could be part of a continuing campaign by the Tax Office to make life more difficult for Australian businesses generally, in circumstances where frequently there is really very little revenue at risk as far as the Tax Office is concerned. We spend about $1.4 billion in collecting revenue. We use a substantial portion of this to harass the very people we are asking to improve their performance, to create more wealth, to take more risks, to invest, and to employ more people. So we have to make sure we have a system where the tax administration is not working against those very objectives. I do not say it is happening overtly, but it is happening as a result of some indirect executive power now increasingly available through the tax ruling system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We allow all this to happen because, when it actually comes down to giving effect to government policies, we simply do not yet supervise sufficiently well the activities of those officials who administer the policies which we proclaim so loudly in this chamber. In the case of the tax rulings, they do not even have to come to the Parliament; they are issued by the Tax Commissioner. Of course, there are companies which may challenge them, but it is the very brave taxpayer these days that attracts the attention of the Tax Commissioner through a legal challenge, and this process, although necessary, does impede the satisfactory administration of justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The draft ruling that I refer to is nine pages long and fairly complex. However, what is at the bottom of this is the question of what deductions companies should be allowed for interest on their borrowings. In essence, the Commissioner is seeking to deny companies interest deductibility in cases where a parent company may have borrowed money to capitalise a subsidiary located outside Australia. This ruling ignores the earlier legal precedent, including a case where the tax authorities lost in the full court. That is the worrying part about it. More importantly, it is another step along the way of the Tax Commissioner arrogating the power to tell these companies which of their commercial transactions he will treat as legitimate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This ruling, I would like to submit to the Senate, is perhaps the worst that we have received in many years in terms of its implications, particularly for Australian multinationals trying to invest abroad&mdash;not only for them, but I suppose they suffer the most severe ramifications. It shows the way in which the Tax Office, in its obsessive pursuit of revenue, can directly and comprehensively work against the general economic policies of this Government and what will almost certainly be the incoming coalition Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Draft ruling TR92/D24 will be expensive. In summary, it will work against efficient operation of this economy. It will work against the international operations of those companies which are brave enough to go overseas and to finance their operations accordingly. It will, therefore, be against the overall objective to internationalise our economy. It will be anti-business in very broad terms at a time when we are trying to encourage business activity. Worst of all, this Parliament will have no say whatsoever in the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to you, Madam Acting Deputy President, and to Senator Ray, that it is time that we in this place looked much more closely at how policy is actually carried out, particularly through the ruling processes in the Tax Office. We have had, in the last 10 years, Budget after Budget, economic statement after economic statement. All of them have proclaimed ringingly the need to improve our economic performance, the need to take the shackles off business and the need to push forward to higher levels of growth and efficiency. That was never more important than now and I use this occasion, in the Budget atmosphere, to raise this matter when our economic performance is so poor and when our levels of unemployment are so socially damaging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pulling the so-called policy levers will not get us out of the mess. We all know that. Only a private sector driven recovery has the potential to do so. Perhaps the discrepancy between the performance that we so earnestly seek in budgets and the performance that we see so starkly outlined in the Budget Papers has something to do with the gap between the noise that is made here and the actions that take place at the official level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust that the Parliament and, perhaps more importantly, the Minister will take note of these concerns. </PARA>

They happen to be in the new seat of Rankin, held very tenuously by the Minister for Small Business, or whatever he is, Mr Beddall. He is being challenged by Mrs Sallyanne Atkinson, who is rather a prominent person in Queensland and who will win that seat, in spite of the fact that the Government has tossed in $13m to try to prop up Mr Beddall. So I am glad that the honourable senator mentioned that; it is most appropriate that he should. In another Labor marginal seat, where a sitting Minister is about to be done over by Mrs Sallyanne Atkinson, in a desperate attempt to keep Mr Beddall there the Government has thrown in some money.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people suggest that this is a pork-barrelling exercise. The Chairman of the Country Mayors Association in New South Wales, Alderman David Johns, was bitterly disappointed by and criticised very strenuously the Federal Government's provision of funds for job creation schemes to metropolitan councils&mdash;just more evidence which I will come to later. Alderman Johns points out that Fairfield and Liverpool get $13.177m, while Dubbo, Wagga, Tamworth and Orange in the country, and many other country centres, receive absolutely nothing. People in Sydney suburbs such as Fairfield can travel to other parts of Sydney looking for work, but a jobless person in country centres does not have the same advantage. Alderman Johns quite rightly pointed out in his press release that the only country region to be given significant job creation funds in category 1 of the Budget allocation was that based around Lismore, which surprisingly just happens to be smack bang in the centre of two very marginal Labor seats which again the Government is desperately trying to retain!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Knowles has kindly given me a note indicating, as Senator Campbell did last night, that Labor's most marginal seat in Western Australia, Stirling, gets something like $7.1m, one of the highest figures in Australia, whereas other equally deserving areas get absolutely nothing. In fact, Alderman Johns in his press release points out that only $10.9m of the $73.65m allocated to New South Wales has gone to country councils, and none of these councils are west of the Great Divide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Non-metropolitan and coastal councils in New South Wales fare little better in the category 2 schemes. Cowra received a $344,000 grant, presumably to compensate for the recent loss of 150 jobs with the closure of Edgells. But Tamworth, which recently lost 220 jobs when East-West Airlines closed its maintenance facilities, received absolutely nothing. Alderman Johns points out, quite rightly again, the absolute inequality of Government support for unemployed people in country areas. Alderman Johns perceives, as many others perceive:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You can't help but feel the funding allocation has been politically motivated.</PARA>
<PARA>The social effects of unemployment, especially in country areas, are hurtful to individuals as well; and there should be no reason why only city people get the benefit of the Government's largess. Much of the money which the Government spends on these schemes comes from the wealth created in country areas, and it is unfortunate that the Government has not seen fit to send some of that back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is evidence coming in from right around Australia. My colleague Mr Philip Ruddock, the member for Dundas, has pointed out that the Ryde City Council received absolutely nothing from the Government's local capital works program, whilst councils in Mr Keating's electorate received, according to their figures&mdash;and I do not think they are right&mdash;some $20m in taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment is hurting people just as much in Ryde as elsewhere in Australia. In fact, 2,422 people were registered for unemployment at the Ryde office in the month of July. It is amazing that that area gets nothing but, just across the way, Mr Keating's electorate gets a huge sum of money. Mr Ruddock has pointed out to me that there is gross discrimination on the Government's part against the northern districts.

It is interesting to note that the Cairns City Council looks after part of Cairns and the Mulgrave Shire Council looks after another part of Cairns and surrounds Cairns. The huge unemployment problem in the Cairns city area&mdash;not in any particular shire&mdash;has been recognised by the Government, but it has been recognised in only one of those local authorities. Cairns city, quite rightly, and good for it, will receive nearly $1.7m for job creation projects and the local authority right next-door, where at least half of those unemployed people live, will receive&mdash;I could ask honourable senators to guess how much&mdash;absolutely zero, zilch, nothing.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can someone explain to me the fairness of that situation?</PARA></TALK.START>

He is outraged that the Government should be so stupid and inequitable in the way it has distributed its money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer of Queensland, Keith De Lacy, who represents one of the Cairns seats, has bought into the deal too.

A lot of the money goes to the State electorate that Mr De Lacy represents and he is under real threat of losing his seat to the Liberal candidate there, Mr Kel Ryan. So maybe the Federal Government was trying to prop him up. The other two seats which surround Cairns and which just happen to be in the Mulgrave Shire area are seats which Norm Millhouse and Scott Sturgess for the Liberal Party could well win from the present Labor incumbents. Maybe there is some interest in that. It is pure speculation and I do not want to indulge in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suffice it to say, however, that the Mulgrave Shire Council is North Queensland's second largest local authority, it is one of the fastest growing areas in the State of Queensland, it shares that unemployment tally with its neighbouring municipality in the Cairns City Council, yet Cairns gets a large sum and Mulgrave Shire gets absolutely nothing. These distributions by the Government are simply unfair. The Government really does not know what it is doing. It is grabbing at any straw to try to save itself as a government and to try to save that one job&mdash;Mr Keating's job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government does things on the run and in an ad hoc way, with no vision for the future, no long term plan, no proposals towards the end of the century which Australia really needs. It just grabs at what it sees as politically attractive schemes to try to overcome the recession that it created, with the two million people that it caused to be unemployed. The Government grabs at these things in an ad hoc fashion and then, because of that, it gets into trouble. We have been shown by example today that when governments do things on the run we get into all sorts of unfair situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst local governments, when they receive the money, will spend it wisely&mdash;and I have every confidence in that&mdash;that is not really what Australia needs. People do not need these artificial jobs that are created and are only very short term. These projects all have to be finished by December 1993. So in 12 months they have got to be there; then they are finished. Whatever jobs are created will be gone again by December next year. What really needs to be done is for real jobs to be created. That is not done by throwing millions of taxpayers' money, which this Government does not have, at problems in politically sensitive areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support briefly the comments of my colleague Senator Macdonald. I particularly make reference to the situation which has occurred in Western Australia with regard to this capital grants program. The first point that I want to make in this regard is the discrimination that has occurred against country shires as far as this capital works program is concerned, and the formula that has been used.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As one works through the list of those shires that have not received any assistance from the capital works program, one finds that they predominantly, but not exclusively, come from country areas. There is a fundamental reason for this and that is that the Government, leading up to an election, has suddenly found that unemployment is a serious problem as far as its electoral prospects are concerned. Of course, in the country shires the recession has hit a lot earlier and a lot harder, and those people who fell into the unemployed category have long left. In fact, it goes back two or three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But also there are some enormous discrepancies in metropolitan Perth. This shows up very clearly when one starts examining the question: why is a formula devised which allows, for example, the Stirling City Council to receive what is effectively a grant of $7m, yet the neighbouring shire of Wanneroo receives nothing&mdash;and nobody can tell me that unemployment stops at local government boundaries? Go to the other side of Stirling to the shire of Bayswater and one finds that it also receives nothing. I wanted to make the point that when one starts doing the breakdown under the formula that is put forward, it is interesting to find where the majority of the money falls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly we find in the paper released from the office of the responsible Minister, Mr Simmons, that in such cases as Stirling there has been an enormous distortion of the figures. For example, Stirling has been counted in five electorates for the $7m, which is five times seven. It makes it appear that there is $35m and there was equity of treatment. But when one breaks it down and allocates, as best as can be estimated, the areas of the shires and where they fall, we find in Stirling, for example, which is held by Mr Edwards, something like the sum of $6.5m will be spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then go to Fremantle. If we break it down once again on an area basis, we find that the sum is somewhere around $5.5m. We then go to Canning. Once again, breaking it down according to area&mdash;and I am sure that Senator Ray would be well aware that Fremantle is held by the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, and that Canning is held by Mr Gear&mdash;we find that the figure is $4.5m. We then move across to Perth, which is currently held by Dr Charlesworth. Mr Stephen Smith is the candidate for the Labor Party, and we find that there is an allocation in the order of $4.5m. </PARA>

We then go to Swan, which is currently held by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), or, as he is known in Western Australia, the Minister for Unemployment. We find that the allocation is in the order of $3.8m. We then go to Brand, which is held by Ms Fatin, and we find that the allocation is $3.5m. We then hit the first Liberal seat, that is, Forrest held by Mr Prosser; and that is some $1.2m less, at $2.3m or in that order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this is not a blatant political exercise in pouring money into Federal marginal seats in Western Australia, I do not know what it is, and it should be condemned as such. If the Government had any decency it would re-look at this particular formula and would take into account all shires that have this particular problem as far as unemployment is concerned and would get a formula which is much fairer. There is no justification for what has been done as far as this capital works program is concerned. I say good luck to those unemployed people who are going to get some assistance. It is long overdue. But I condemn the Government for the way that it has put this formula together and the unfair way in which the money has been allocated in Western Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable senators would have seen in the press, the UK has announced that it does intend to contribute military aircraft to patrol a no-fly zone in southern Iraq to protect the Shi'ite. Prime Minister Major has said the Security Council resolutions provide the legal authority for this action to be taken. It is expected that similar decisions will be taken shortly by both the United States and France.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the Australian reaction to this, as I said in the Senate on 18 August, a couple of days ago, the Government is greatly concerned that Iraq has persistently flouted the authority of the UN resolutions right across the board and in particular in relation to the Shi'ite. The special rapporteur appointed by the Commission on Human Rights to inquire into the human rights situation in Iraq briefed the Security Council last week. In a scathing critique of Iraqi repression of civilians, he confirmed that Iraq was flagrantly in breach of the human rights provisions of resolution 688, particularly as they affected the Shi'ite and the Kurds. Again, as I said in the press release on 16 August, the Australian Government calls on Iraq to end its repressive military action against the Shi'ite and to allow humanitarian aid to the wounded and displaced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in light of that, against that background of concern and statements, we would support the UK proposal to patrol a no-fly zone in southern Iraq to protect the Shi'ite from attacks by Iraqi aircraft. We are awaiting final details, but we expect that the prohibition would prevent Iraqi aircraft from flying south of the thirty-second parallel. It would supplement, of course, another prohibition which has been in effect for more than a year on Iraqi aircraft flying north of the thirty-sixth parallel to protect the Kurds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the likely effect of all this, we certainly hope that the declaration of a no-fly zone will not lead to renewed hostilities with Iraq. The no-fly zone in the north of the country has operated for more than a year without leading to military clashes. That gives some grounds for confidence in that respect, but it is really up to Saddam Hussein. Again, as I said a couple of days ago, Saddam Hussein would be very ill-advised to underestimate the determination of the international community in seeing him comply with UN resolutions in all respects, including his treatment of the civilian population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not been asked to contribute militarily to this proposed operation, but approval has been given for three Australian Defence Force personnel serving with US and UK forces to deploy to the Middle East with their units if required&mdash;and I would expect that to be the extent of any involvement by Australia in this exercise.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Patterson says, `Do something'. In fact, this Parliament has done something. As Senator Patterson will know, in both the social security and health areas, legislation has passed through this chamber which provides for an offence equivalent to receiving stolen goods. In other words, a person who solicits another person to go out and obtain this information from, particularly, government agencies is himself guilty of an offence. That has been a particularly good and innovative part of those statutes, although it may well be that a more comprehensive statute could be put in place. I understand that we will get reports from Mr Lavarch's Committee in relation to that umbrella offence. It may be that Sir Harry Gibbs's committee also has some worthwhile things to say in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler also asked about making the wrongful disclosure of confidential information a criminal offence. Already in relation to government held information, it is a criminal offence to wrongfully disclose it under section 70 of the Crimes Act, and under specific statutes that wrongful disclosure is also dealt with. I guess Senator Spindler's question relates to whether in fact there might be a crime created for situations where private organisations holding information which it could be anticipated should be kept in a confidential manner disclose it without the permission of the person concerned, and Senator Spindler suggests the telecommunications power might be used in that regard. This can be taken into account by the Government; it will be taken into account.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I might deal with the last part of the question first, the program has been set up through the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority. We introduced legislation in 1987 for that Authority and amended it again in 1991. In that legislation we provided for assistance for firms adding value to raw materials in Australia. That legislation was supported on both occasions by the Opposition and it was under that program that this process was set up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason this assistance has been offered to BWK is that throughout the world at the present time it is recognised in the textile industry that there is a shift going on from Europe to the Asia-Pacific region. A number of companies are considering new investments in further wool processing plants in this part of the world and there is a window of opportunity for Australia to win new investments in further processing of the woolclip. But we have to compete with other countries in this region to obtain those plants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one takes the BWK example referred to in the question, substantial offers of assistance were, I understand, made to it by other countries. It is because we are the largest producer of wool in the world and because we should be processing more of our wool&mdash;currently we process only 5 per cent of the woolclip, which is a disgraceful performance in international terms&mdash;that the Government saw the need for us to take advantage of this window of opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been quite clear from scattered statements by Opposition spokesmen and so on that the Opposition would let that window of opportunity close and let those plants go to other countries. The Government is not prepared to do that, consistent with our general view of industry policy, which we have developed over a number of years, in terms of assistance to industries like steel, which might have closed down under Opposition policies but which have been very successful under the Government's policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new plant at Geelong is an $85m investment. The Federal Government will support that investment through a taxable grant of $5m and a loan of $15m. A number of claims have been made&mdash;particularly in the Geelong region, I notice&mdash;by Opposition spokesmen that the Government is discriminating in favour of this company and against other wool processors, particularly Australian ones. These claims are absolute nonsense. Any company planning to invest in such a plant can apply to the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority in the same way as this company did. It is generally accepted that, to be economically viable, these plants have to produce at least 4,000 tonnes of wool per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program to which I referred earlier in my answer to this question gives the flexibility to provide support through a combination of loans and grants, unlike the grants-only part of the TCFDA program, which is supported under different incentives.

There were 27 years of low base, right throughout the 1970s, and one per cent growth in manufacturing a year&mdash;an extraordinarily bad performance. As a result of neglect over many years, the wool industry, which is one of the great industries of this country, slipped over a period of years into decline. The result of Australia's poor performance is that Australia misses out on export income. A tops making plant adds 35 per cent to the value of Australian wool. By 1996, this plant will increase the proportion of the clip processed here to 8 per cent, and investments in other companies, which I am confident will take place, will increase that proportion further.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a singularly misinformed or ignorant interjection on the basis that this was a proposition from the Government to the ACTU and the matter, if it is accepted, will then go to the IRC for determination. But at this stage it is only a matter for discussion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision of the ACTU yesterday was a decision that took note of the social wage component of the Budget. It is important once again to reiterate that what the Government is concerned about and what the ACTU is concerned about through the accord is not simply the matter of wages. It is actually the matter of living standards. Living standards are determined by the level of wages, by the level of taxes and by the social wage&mdash;that is, the public goods supplied to households and the cost of supplying them. So the basic issue here is living standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACTU Executive gave the Budget a big tick. It approved the social wage component in the Budget and it recognised that the Budget focus is a focus for jobs and more jobs, and a focus to take care of those Australians who are not in a position to take care of themselves because of their low incomes, their health, their age or some other disability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the ACTU Executive said to us, by virtue of its decision yesterday, was that a new wage system will now be introduced into Australia. This will be a decentralised wage system&mdash;a system that will be built on enterprise or workplace bargaining&mdash;and the ACTU will put its shoulder to the wheel as a first priority in delivering that system. This is exactly in conformity with the second option that we put to the ACTU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACTU has also said to its affiliates that if it is not appropriate or if it finds that employers, as is their right, do not choose to enter into a workplace bargain, they should file an application to amend their awards for the $10 and the $10, meaning that those applications can be brought on at an appropriate time for the Industrial Relations Commission to deal with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this response by the ACTU, which has also asked for some further discussions on this matter and wishes to talk the matter through further with its affiliates, as a very positive response, a good response and a response that should be hailed as that by all the commentators. We are now constructing a once-in-a-century shift in wage fixation&mdash;a movement from centralised to decentralised wage fixing in a managed way, smoothly, without a big bang and without following the course that the Opposition would choose to follow of increasing taxes, lowering wages and engaging in cultural cleansing by conducting an ideological campaign against the union movement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Justice. I refer the Minister to efforts made by Australian law enforcement agencies to locate the Gillespie children who were recently taken from Australia in breach of an order of the Family Court. Is it true that Coastwatch and the Australian Navy monitored a disabled boat off Australia's northern coastline a week or so after the Gillespie children were reported as missing? Why were Australia's Federal Police still informing the Government on 24 July that the Gillespie children were still in Australia when it now appears that they had left Australian shores by boat off northern Australia about a week earlier? Was there any communication between Coastwatch and Customs authorities and the Federal Police, who had the principal responsibility for the search? Will the Government release a full report on the search for the Gillespie children, including the nature and level of resources committed and the nature and extent of communications between the Australian Federal Police, Immigration, Customs and Coastwatch authorities?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="349" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A series of questions was asked by Senator Hill in relation to this important matter. There was Coastwatch and Royal Australian Navy involvement in responding to Mayday calls which were picked up by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. That did take place. The AFP itself was not aware, during the course of the Coastwatch response to those Mayday calls, of the Coastwatch interest in a particular vessel. Coastwatch had not been tasked by the AFP or by Customs in relation to any particular vessel, because there was no identification or description of a vessel which would enable a task to be given to Coastwatch in relation to a particular search related to the abduction and disappearance of the Gillespie children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were other questions asked by Senator Hill. I was not able to note them all, but I can assure him that very considerable resources were allocated by the Australian Federal Police and the Customs Service for the search. From personal knowledge and from conversations I had with the Deputy Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police&mdash;and staff of my ministerial office have had many conversations with those holding operational responsibility within the Australian Federal Police&mdash;I understand that very considerable resources were dedicated to this search. Unfortunately, they were not effective in locating the fact that the Gillespie children, with the prince, escaped the Australian jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This happens from time to time. There are other such occasions and one occurred a few weeks ago with the abduction of a child in Bondi. In that case, the tremendous cooperation between the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Customs Service and the New South Wales police led to the speedy location and return of the child. In the Gillespie case the cooperation did not lead to the identification of the fact that the prince and the children were going to be spirited away as they were. How they were spirited away is still a matter of operational sensitivity. Investigations are still continuing and, whilst I offer Senator Hill or the relevant spokesman a briefing on these operational matters, I believe that it would be most unwise to elaborate further on the situation. I think I will eventually be able to satisfy Senator Hill that considerable resources were devoted to this very important search, but it still failed to prevent the removal of the children from Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was first asked what the cost would be. I do not have a briefing note on cost and, if I may, I would like to take that part of the three- or four-part question that I have been asked on notice and reply later. The Bureau of Mineral Resources has had a key role in providing advice to governments on resource matters, as well as being an advisory body carrying out strategic mapping aimed at providing the geological knowledge necessary to support the success of our mineral and petroleum exploration industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are two discrete functions and, contrary to some media report, the resource assessment function is not primarily focused on servicing resource companies. Its main role is to provide the essential petroleum and minerals assessment input to advice to government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, this function is being transferred to the new Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Sciences, which is now to be called ABARS. The direct number of staff involved is about 55, with some additional clerical support staff, compared with the total current BMR complement of about 550. A physical transfer of these staff will most likely be required. The cost is currently being investigated. Although I will provide Senator Bell with details on this matter later, I am advised in this brief that it is not expected to be a major cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategic research and mapping function carried out by the remainder of the BMR will continue to be carried out by the Australian Geological Research Organisation, AGSO, while the review announced by Mr Griffiths and Mr Crean on 13 August runs its course. I can table the joint announcement by Ministers Crean and Griffiths about the new arrangements for the Bureau of Mineral Resources which may help an understanding of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is correct that a considerable number&mdash;126 in total&mdash;of representations were made on this matter to the Prime Minister and relevant Ministers prior to the announcement of the review.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What the situation thus described reveals, I think, in relevant part is as follows. In August 1988 Mr Burke purchased two duty free vehicles, a Toyota Corolla and a Toyota Starlet. The Department's records show that approval was sought on 6 January 1989 from the Irish Foreign Ministry to import duty free, as a third duty free vehicle, a Mercedes Benz 230E.

That is not a matter that has been in the public domain hitherto, but it does explain, I think, a great deal about what subsequently happened. The Toyota Starlet, in respect of which he had thus sought to pay outstanding taxes and duties, was then written off in an accident on 16 February, after this application was lodged and before&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To anticipate Senator Knowles's inevitable request for the release of that and other relevant documents related to the Toyota Starlet, I am happy to put those documents now on the public record. The documents relating to that particular car were, in fact, not produced in response to the FOI request. The decision maker in my Department&mdash;without any reference to me, as is appropriate in these things&mdash;took the view that as that particular car had, in effect, become privatised, or been the subject of a duty payment, it was not, therefore, properly the subject of the FOI request because it did not relate to anything, any more than the purchase of a toilet roll did, done by him in the pursuit of any privilege attached to his office.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the identity of the officer who was involved in that termination process at the Canberra end, it was Mr Forrester. Mr Forrester did talk to Mr Butler, certainly. Mr Forrester also communicated directly with the Bangkok officer concerned and the officer in Bangkok, the husband of this woman, was in no doubt whatsoever that Mr Forrester was the officer concerned making the decision about his future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nor was the wife, in the context of her sexual harassment complaint, in any doubt about the identity of Mr Forrester as the person handling, in the first instance, that complaint; nor was she in any doubt about Mr Forrester's role in relation to her husband. That was something that was open to her at any stage to express concern about and to go down any one of the other routes that were available to her for resolving this matter if she thought, for whatever reason, including the identity of the officer engaged in this conciliation process, she was not going to get a fair go. That remains the case. None of those options has been excluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to take this opportunity to put further on the record my understanding of the advice that has been given to me about the precise procedures that have been followed. None of this is inconsistent with anything I said yesterday or the day before but it just adds another point or two to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say this: since the complaint was first brought to the attention of my Department&mdash;I am talking now about the sexual harassment complaint&mdash;it has been handled, on all the advice available to me, and I endorse this conclusion, in strict accordance with the Public Service Commission's guidelines. One of the most important principles that the Department sought to observe contained in those guidelines is that of confidentiality in order to protect the privacy of both parties. Might I, in that respect, refer, as I should have yesterday, to page 44 of the guidelines on eliminating sexual harassment, which state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Privacy principles require that internal disclosure should be limited strictly to those staff who need to have access for official purposes, e.g. those investigating a complaint or taking follow-up action.</PARA>
<PARA>Those strictures obviously apply with even more rigour to someone seeking to put this into the public domain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In following the guidelines, my Department has done the following things: it has ensured that the complainant was fully aware of all the options available to her from the time she first reported the matter to a departmental workplace harassment contact officer. I have spelt out previously&mdash;I do not repeat them&mdash;what those options were. The Department has provided the complainant with copies of the Public Service Commission's guidelines on eliminating sexual harassment and the departmental policy statement on workplace harassment, the relevant part of which I tabled yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department sought advice on several occasions in fact&mdash;this is the question I left not specifically answered yesterday because I was not clear what the answer was&mdash;from the Merit Protection and Review Agency, as is required by those guidelines, to confirm the correctness of the process being followed. Again, my Department maintained regular contact with the complainant in order to provide further opportunities for her to discuss any concerns that she might have. This contact included meetings between the complainant, her spouse and two female members of the Department's workplace harassment group. Two additional meetings were attended also by Mr Forrester. Mr Forrester and one of the workplace harassment contact officers maintained contact with the person against whom the complaint was made, as one would expect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to my own role in this, let me say just once more and, again, in slightly more detail, that I am aware that ambassadors are appointed by the Executive Council on my recommendation. This does require me to satisfy myself in this particular case, where the person against whom the complaint has been made is an unattached officer of the Public Service, that these matters are being handled in accordance with the Public Service Commission's guidelines. Mr Forrester has reported to me twice now in writing. There has been some supplementary oral reporting in the last couple of days. It is for those reasons that Mr Forrester has reported to me on progress and he will continue to do so while he remains involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would, however&mdash;and this is the key point&mdash;be quite inappropriate for me to intrude further into the actual handling of this matter. I am sure that point would be understood by anyone who has any sensitivity or understanding about the way in which these delicate personnel matters should be handled. I hope that that is a sufficiently complete answer to put this matter in the public domain to rest once and for all unless, of course, the complainant should herself choose to raise it in some other public forum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I am afraid that the explanation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) raises more questions than it answers. First of all, I think it is important to know why this matter is on the public record. It certainly was not me who put it there. This matter came on to the public record as a result of a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> article on 29 July, written by John Lyons, the Herald's correspondent in New York.</PARA></TALK.START>

He then chose, after two more articles&mdash;one in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> and one in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>&mdash;to have an interview with <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>.

Just as he did in answer to Senator Knowles's questions on Brian Burke and just as he did with the Marshall Islands affair, he has given one answer and had to change it each time he has come back into the chamber.

What disturbed me in the first instance was that there were reports that a woman had made a claim of sexual harassment against a very senior bureaucrat. I immediately saw a situation of strength against weakness&mdash;I say this with respect to some honourable senators&mdash;in the power struggle within the bureaucracy. I read a response in the newspaper that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was seeking to conciliate the matter. That seemed to me&mdash;and we have since had explanations as to the statutory background for it&mdash;to be a pretty unusual response.

I thought that the Department would establish an inquiry to see whether the case had been made out and, if so, to take certain actions that would follow therefrom. That is why the question was asked in the first instance, as I understand it, by Senator Bishop the other day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then information came to light to suggest that in fact the woman's husband&mdash;who also turned out to be a DFAT employee in Bangkok&mdash;was returned from Bangkok to Canberra by the Department, allegedly for incompetence or some other breach. That complicated the matter considerably, because here we have a negotiating process taking place within the Department whilst the husband of this woman apparently has some action hanging over his head. That concerns me. I immediately ask whether there can be a proper process within the Department as to whether this woman's claim had been made in circumstances where something was being held over her husband. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then, further evidence has come to light suggesting that the action being taken against the husband was really quite serious. Today, the matter has been further complicated by the fact that we find that the same bureaucrats are involved&mdash;and have been involved&mdash;in the process concerning the two parties at that early stage. I think that raises many questions as to whether the Department is handling this sensitive matter properly and whether the Minister is meeting his responsibility to ensure that the Department handles this matter properly. It is quite within our rights to ask questions relating to those matters, and if we did not do so we would be failing in our responsibility. </PARA>

My contention is that he has not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to look at the chronology. This event occurred in February 1992. Six weeks later the husband of the woman concerned, who is a Thai national and may not understand the nuances of Senator Evans's guidelines&mdash;and I will come back to those in a moment&mdash;was returned to Australia after a telephone conversation took place between Mr Butler, that is the person who is alleged to have perpetrated the harassment, and Mr Forrester. During the process of that conversation, I understand that a ground for his return was discussed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans says that the husband was given the grounds for his termination of that position in Thailand. My information is that he was not given the grounds for that termination prior to his leaving that were in fact subsequently cited as the grounds for his termination. Senator Evans has said that the husband was given grounds prior to his leaving Thailand. He has not told us whether the grounds that allegedly were told to this man prior to his leaving were the same as the ones that he was given when he returned to Australia and told that his position in Thailand was terminated.

The Minister did the same with the Burke matter and the Marshall Islands affair, and he is doing the same with the Butler affair. It just will not do. All mates together: we have one rule for mates and another for everybody else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I told the Minister yesterday that I was very concerned about this matter for the simple reason that I have raised in this chamber another issue concerning a woman who raised a complaint.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have here the potential for pressure to be placed on this woman and/or her husband to make them abandon the claim. If it is abandoned, it can be neatly swept under the carpet and there will be no findings, nothing known about the outcome and no criticism of the way the Minister has handled or has failed to handle it. To try to say that the Minister has dealt with it properly, when every day he has had to come back into the chamber and correct himself, when every day new information has had to be dragged out of him&mdash;and his only response has been to play not the issue but the woman and to use insulting, unpleasant language and think that that absolves him of any responsibility&mdash;quite frankly, I do not find acceptable and neither do people who listen in either, be they in the building or elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a serious matter. It deals with the competency of the Minister.

He tries to tell us that he did not know of any of this information because nobody told him.

We are not discussing a matter between two clerks who sit on the second left-hand side of a room in a large departmental building. We are discussing a matter that is affecting a person who was appointed on the recommendation of the Minister by the Executive Council, and a lowly stenographer. That is what we are discussing.

As I said, in his response to me earlier the one thing that he said that I took great delight in hearing was that he is responsible.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister representing the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Kemp on 19 August 1992, relating to the provision of Budget estimates and forecasts.</PARA>
<PARA>The point at issue here is that Senator Button was responding to my question yesterday as to whether the Government would be prepared to table in the Senate the forward estimates of outlays and revenues, particularly revenues, through to the year 1995-96. He said he would find out whether that information could be tabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button said in the chamber today that it was the practice of the Government not to include such projections in the Budget Papers. In a technical sense, of course, Senator Button is right. However, in relation to the One Nation statement which was brought down by the Government this February, the Government did put down its forward estimates of revenues and outlays, and I suggest that it did this for a very good reason. The reason it did this was to attempt to argue that its tax cuts were affordable. On page 149 of the One Nation statement, we see the very table which I have asked the Government now to update and to present to the Senate so that we can see whether the tax cuts which were proposed in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> and which were, to a certain extent, confirmed in the Budget Speech of Mr Dawkins on Tuesday night are still affordable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, you will be aware that this has become a matter of important public debate. We know that the Treasury has prepared these forward estimates of outlays and revenues and we know that the Government has a problem, because the Government itself has told us in the Budget Speech that there is a problem. It has signalled that it is possible that a number of taxes will have to be raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to you, Mr Deputy President, to the media and to the Australian people that it is vital that if we are going to properly evaluate this Budget and see what hidden time bombs this Budget has in store for us, we must know now, and the Government must tell us, what its forward projections of revenues are. In an attempt to justify the One Nation statement, the Government was quite happy to put forward such projections. It is not happy to put forward such projections now and I suggest that the very reason for this is that it would show a huge black hole in the Government's prospective budgets in the years ahead. I suggest that this can mean only one thing&mdash;further sharp rises in taxes as the Government itself has hinted at in the Budget Papers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not asking something which is unreasonable, because the Opposition has outlined in the Fightback statement its year on year projections to show how the very substantial income tax cuts which we have proposed can be afforded. Therefore, as we go towards the next election, it is not unreasonable that, through the Government's great resources, Mr Tony Cole and Dr Preston&mdash;who spent such time going through the forward projections of the coalition's Fightback program&mdash;turn their minds, as I am sure they already have, towards encouraging the Government to publish these forward estimates so we can make a direct comparison and the Australian people can be better informed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand, on our view and from other sources, that a huge black hole has emerged in the forward projections of the Government's Budgets in the next two or three years which will make it impossible to afford the income tax cuts it promised without further sharp rises in other forms of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we get these figures. Senator Button has refused to table the figures in the Senate today, but I urge the Senate, the media and the Australian public to put as much pressure as possible on the Government to come clean and show us how big this black hole is and what sorts of taxes will be imposed on the Australian community if by some mischance Mr Keating was elected Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report on radiological services in relation to Medicare benefits was tabled by the Standing Committee on Community Affairs on 28 April. It was an important report in many ways and led to the repeal of regulations which were due to commence a few days later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has accepted all of the Committee's recommendations and I would like to comment on the implication of this. In effect, the Government has acknowledged that the processes and time frame of the proposed reforms were totally inadequate. The original intention was to make quite substantial changes in the operation of radiological services, without having much idea of the impact of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the Committee's belief that such a procedure was impractical and could have substantial effects on the community. It was clear that a number of the organisations and involved groups had not been consulted adequately about the proposed changes and that even a number of radiologists believed that they had not been given sufficient information on the issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One consequence of this high-handed approach was the failure to recognise the important role played by rural general practitioners providing radiological services in remote areas, and the need for out-of-hours services in certain locations. Another consequence was the amount of opposition to the proposed restructure that surfaced during the Committee stages. This illustrated the wide-ranging and potentially devastating effect the restructure would have on many. It also points to the need for adequate consultations with groups likely to be affected by reforms in the area of health services in order for the provision of radiological services to meet the differing needs of the community. The Committee recommended that further consultations were essential and I was delighted to see that the Government has recognised the importance of consulting with those groups which will be affected by new regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believed that it was essential for any changes that were to be made to be made as part of a comprehensive reform. There seems to be little logic in a piecemeal approach with a drastic cut to the income of some practitioners, an increase in the fees of other practitioners and little idea of either the short or long term effect of such changes on the availability and cost of services in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult to understand why any change of this magnitude would have been undertaken in the atmosphere of misinformation, poor planning and general disorder which marked the process. It was evident from the number of submissions to the Committee&mdash;and in fact the number was 96&mdash;and from the public hearings that there was no rational structure to the reorganisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This piecemeal approach was also manifest in both the research undertaken during the planning of the restructure and the limited consultation that occurred during this phase. For a policy that was supposed to provide a cure to existing problems and to prevent any reduction in the quality of future radiological services, it was surprising how little evidence was marshalled to demonstrate the nature and causes of those alleged problems, and how little research was conducted to understand what sort of radiological services would be needed to meet the future community needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Answers to these complex questions depended on systematic research and consultation with a range of organisations. However, these issues were foreclosed by a narrow and simplistic approach adopted by those who prepared the restructure. Even the findings of the consultants employed to prepare the costing models of radiological practices&mdash;for instance, that cross-subsidisation was untenable&mdash;were ultimately eschewed in favour of arguments of only one of the groups involved in the provision of radiological services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For these reasons I am pleased that the Government has endorsed the Committee's recommendations that further research be conducted into a wide range of issues relating to the provision of flexible and possibly more specialised radiological services, including after-hours services, and that those responsible for planning the reforms consult more widely on the matters which impact on patients, State government services, medical practitioners and the other professionals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also should be noted that the Government has recognised the Committee's concern that the issue of overservicing, as it relates to radiology, needs to be thoroughly researched and its causes understood before any changes are made to legislation already in place which is designed to address this issue. Suggestions were continually made that overservicing was rife, that it was a major problem and that the implementation of the new fee structure would put an end to this type of fraud. However, no evidence was put forward by the Department or the Health Insurance Commission to substantiate these allegations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, the Committee was concerned at such charges and has requested the Department to provide a report on the matters to see whether there was any such relationship between overservicing and the growth and provision of certain types of services. The Committee believes that this process would be more sensible than developing further legislation, as there was no proof that the legislation already in place was ineffective. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as this Parliament is concerned, the interest is not necessarily in just the base information but also in our recommendations, of which there are a significant number. The Government has responded to them all; it has responded to some positively, put some on the back burner and specifically rejected others. If we are to make anything of the value of Senate committees in this country, we should follow the pattern established by a few other committees in the past and ensure that our reports are followed up by government; ensure that debate takes place with government on those issues where, for example, we disagree; and ensure that, where there is agreement, we assist government to fulfil the obligations that it is prepared to accept as a result of these recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to go into all the recommendations because a number of other members of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training wish to speak. However, I want to make a couple of in-principle points that relate not only to this report but to education as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, there is a tendency&mdash;and I note it in the Government's response&mdash;for a significant number of major movers and shakers in the education industry in this country to separate what they call vocational training from personal development. Personal development courses have been called other names, but basically such people have attempted to split the two as appropriate parts of the educational activity spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make it quite plain today that the biggest mistake we can make as a country, which is now starting to be much more interested in training than we were about 10 years ago, is to accept that false dichotomy. There is no major split between vocational training and personal development teaching or education. If we placed certain attributes into the category of personal development, we would see that those attributes are an essential springboard to what is described as strict vocational training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, a course which has been described as one which creates in the learner confidence, self-respect, personal development, a capacity to work with others and a capacity to solve issues as an individual or as part of a group, has already done a great deal to prepare a person for further training. Yet so many responses&mdash;it is, unfortunately, implicit in some of the Government's responses&mdash;to the big educational questions do make that distinction. They say, `Yes, there is strict vocational training, which is what we have to get people into, and then there is other personal development stuff'. Ballroom dancing, flower arranging and those types of activities are used as examples to indicate that personal development courses are less important than what they see as the very important strictly vocational courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two are part of the same spectrum. People who walk into a Neighbourhood House and learn to be competent at a skill&mdash;learn to relate to other people around them, learn to problem-solve, feel more at home with themselves and their community and feel more self-confident&mdash;are on the way to becoming educated people. Without those basic attributes it is very difficult for someone to be a successful learner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a bit like teaching children to ride a bike. The first thing to do is to get them to be slightly adventurous, physically competent and confident. If you walk alongside  them and say, `The penalty for failure is this', `I don't think you can do it', or other such phrases, you inevitably inhibit their capacity to learn that skill. So when government bureaucrats in Canberra, for example, say we should be putting our money into vocational training rather than personal development courses, it is obvious that they are blind to the absolute connection between personal development and the successful learning of skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report quite clearly shows that there is a continuum and that getting people back into education and training starts with courses which, in traditional terms, may not be described as educational with a capital `E', but for many people they are a first step back into the educational process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting to look at three of the major companies in Germany&mdash;Mercedes, Siemens and Bayer. Like most major German companies, they have a very well organised program for training their employees. The vast majority of their employees are being continuously trained throughout their working lives. Those companies regard the training of their employees as an essential responsibility of a major company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting that, when outlining their corporate goals, these German companies say quite clearly that the training of workers is not just about teaching them how to use a lathe better, handle electronic equipment better, or work on an assembly line better. They quite clearly push the line that workers ought to improve their own self-confidence and learn how to do things for their own sake&mdash;set goals for themselves and enjoy achieving those goals. They want their workers to do that because they know that a fully developed, rounded, confident worker is someone who can be trained in specific skills later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Breakdowns were taken of German industry and figures were examined.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that came out quite clearly was that for every person who was doing a specific skill retraining course in those four major companies that I mentioned, there was another one doing some course related to personal development and recreation, with the company's full support. It did not matter whether it was bushwalking, abseiling, repairing motor cars or whatever. The aim was to get people to be competent in something that they chose and that was of interest to them. That was the first step. After that, if they wanted to, they could move into areas of specific skill training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the message I want to leave today. It is very easy for bureaucrats in Canberra who have to spend money in the most appropriate and responsible way, in a time of scarce dollars, to plump for what they regard as skilled vocational training. At the same time it is very easy for those bureaucrats to neglect the essential springboard value that personal development courses have in getting people into the education spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with those bureaucrats who, for example, say that if people are unskilled, they are likely to be unemployed and are likely to be unemployed more often than other people; that if people are unskilled, they will have less value to the gross domestic product and to themselves. That is true. There is no doubt that many unskilled jobs in this community and in a number of other OECD countries have gone by the board. They have simply been phased out. Therefore, the need constantly to re-skill people and to upgrade their skills is paramount and obvious to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I make, along with a number of people from this adult education area who came to our Committee, as distinct from a number of these bureaucrats&mdash;although we all see the same problem&mdash;is that you have to have a springboard into particular skilled training that starts by making people feel keen, confident and able to relate to their peer group. One of the key things is that most education never occurs in an atmosphere of loneliness and isolation. Learning occurs, generally speaking, in consultation and in cooperation with other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that some bureaucrats have the notion that education of the future will involve a person sitting in front of a modem, probably surrounded by a wall, a la Port Arthur model prison chapel, tapping on a keyboard, putting in questions and getting responses and vice versa and ticking off the number of successes one gets to the questions asked. That is a very isolated operation. I have been into schools and I have seen this sort of thing happening. Young people put their headphones on, go into the booth and then spend an hour isolated with their thoughts, and in some cases the teachers are not working with them before or after or even during that process. All one has is an isolating experience, not an extending experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer in regard to young people learning French or adults learning French or German or Swahili or Chinese or Japanese is not to use isolating techniques of learning like that. It is to get people to work together, to get from a group that which you cannot get from a book or from a video. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer in future to upgrading the skills of our society will not necessarily be a technological one. If that were the case, many years ago we would have had every kid in this country strapped up to a modem with earphones on, punching away at a keyboard or doing things by using television. That has not happened, for the simple reason that human beings prefer to learn in a situation which is a mixture of individual activity, quiet study and group activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone in this chamber knows that most of what they have learnt has been precisely as a result of that mixture of activities&mdash;what we do as a group and what we do individually as we read or watch videos or television. The Government must examine this response and it must examine other documents that come before it. We have to ask ourselves a basic question. Are we artificially creating a dichotomy between personal development and vocational training? If we are, we will end up funding and running programs which take into account only half of a person's learning potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is easier to say, `We only fund what is strictly vocational and that personal development courses are to be paid for by the user'. If we make those distinctions, we isolate a significant number of people who ought to be coming back into the education area. I refer, for example, to people who had bad experiences at school and do not want to know any more about education. We have to get those people back again because they are the ones who, in a changing society, are usually most at risk in terms of their economic potential, their capacity to get jobs and to hold jobs and their capacity to deal with their own lives&mdash;literally running a household, bringing up children and relating to each other. Some people are more vulnerable than others and the ones who left school early are generally, according to virtually all the studies I have seen, the ones most likely to get into difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we believe in fairness and equity and giving everybody a chance to fulfil their potential, we have to look at our education system becoming more relevant. If we do not, firstly, it will fail a significant number of people in our community and that is unfair; secondly, we will waste a lot of talent that ought to be available to our society; and thirdly, people will walk away from the education system. They will say, `I do not want to know about it'. In many cases these are people who would love to send their children to school and have those children reach the highest levels of attainment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The middle classes will start to walk away from public or publicly funded education, and they have already begun to do so. One has only to look at the figures. I believe Tasmania has the lowest percentage of students in private schools compared with students in public schools. To some extent that is because the education there is better, or was better than in other States, because it has had more money spent on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To take the point further, no formal education system at the moment seems capable of educating all the people who come into it. There will be many people who do not realise their potential within the formal education system. They may be the very brightest ones who are simply bored, the bright ones who are not taken to their full potential; or they may be those with lesser abilities or those with some social handicap which makes it difficult for them to learn. Both of those groups miss out under the current formal education system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The adult and community education area has and always will have a vital role to play. It picks up those people. It also picks up the people who have gone through the formal education system and who need to know more for their own personal benefit or for the increased capacity to get on in their jobs, to get new jobs, to change jobs. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we translate what is lacking in this chamber to what is happening out there in the community at large, we can see that the improvement of particular skills by a wide section of people in the community can only benefit the country, let alone individuals. Our children, the ones who are 19, 20 and 21 years of age, on the whole have been a bit better trained than we have in terms of the overall skill pattern. But, nevertheless, at high school or, for that matter, at primary school or even at university, one cannot give students all the skills they are going to need throughout their lives. So adult and community education will always fulfil a major need in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big question is whether the Government can make the departments responsible for reacting to this report; whether the Government is prepared to force them to make a 100 per cent effort in moving these recommendations forward. They have all-party support. We spent a lot of time on them. They represented the attitudes and ideas of a very significant number of people throughout this country. They represent the hopes and aspirations of a lot of people who previously have been cut out of the education system, who will not have what they want given to them by universities or by the TAFE system, who are going to have to look at the adult and community education providers for the skills and the personal development that they need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a pioneer activity because governments have traditionally shied away from funding or being involved in adult and community education. No government likes to pick up commitments which will cost it more and more each year. But if the clever country is going to be just that&mdash;a clever, comfortable, happy country&mdash;and if we are going to move towards those sorts of goals, then the development of adult and community education will be absolutely vital. It will not be done through TAFE, universities and high schools alone. There is an absolute requirement for this flexible sector of the education industry. It will require a rethink on the part of governments of all persuasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefit from this joint party Committee's unanimous recommendations is that, regardless of what party is in government here next year, there will be a group of people who will be able to pursue an agenda, and the agenda simply says: `No. 1 right through to No. 30'. Adult and community education is a vital part of the whole education industry&mdash;of the educational spectrum&mdash;and it has to be supported in a way that it has not been supported in the past. This Parliament has a responsibility to do something about that. If governments get laggardly over this issue; if they get conned by the bureaucrats, who will do as little as possible; if they get conned by hypotheses and theories, and ideas that are half-baked and that, for example, separate vocational from self-development courses; if they get conned by those sorts of notions, then it is the role of this chamber, in particular, to make sure that they are brought back to reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is a challenge here for the chamber&mdash;to make sure that we make our reports work and that governments not only have to respond in terms of the written word in a formal report like this, but that they actually carry out the propositions that we put forward. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to address a few remarks on the tabling of the Government's response to this report because I think it is important to do so. The timeliness of this response is to be acknowledged. By way of further endorsement of the Chairman's remarks, I can only say that I was fortunate to be a member of the recent parliamentary delegation to South America. On that trip, I was reminded of the very sorts of things that Senator Aulich, as Chairman of the Committee, has just been speaking about; that is, that there is, and should not be, a distinction between vocational education and the development of people's personal skills. It was self-evident, particularly in Brazil, where we were fortunate enough as a delegation to visit the office of the TNT transport company, an Australian company which had made an investment in Brazil. Part of that investment was for the company to meet the need of its work force in basic workplace education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the education was necessary was not only an indictment of the education system of the country but also an acknowledgment of the personal skills that are required to work in any industry. One can imagine the chaos which would be caused in delivering parcels from one end of Brazil to the other if the literacy of the deliverers was in question. As well as that, one can imagine the further inability of workers to perform the most basic functions of a worker in the transport industry if there was little knowledge of geography and the clerical skills required to ensure that the right parcel, package or item was delivered to the correct consignee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was made apparent at the most basic level to those of us who visited the company that there was a need for adequate education and that, because this was not present in the country, the operating company had to provide for that need. In doing so, that company was then able to develop loyalty to the company based on what it had provided for its workers. Of course, the workers' appreciativeness was reflected in the fact that, unique or at least uncommon to the companies in San Paulo, this particular company had a loyal, longstanding and fairly static work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I use that example to endorse the Chairman's remarks.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REVIEW OF THE AUSTRALIAN CENTRE FOR INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH CONDUCTED BY THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DEFENCE AND TRADE, AUGUST 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">BACKGROUND</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) was established as a statutory authority within the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Act 1982 (ACIAR Act 1982). That legislation provided for scrutiny and review by way of a sunset clause limiting the life of the organisation to 12 years (June 1994), subject to a review at the 10 year stage, ie. by June 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to arranging for the mandatory sunset review, on 18 October 1991 the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator the Hon. Gareth Evans, formally referred the matters of ACIAR's effectiveness against its charter and its statutory authority status to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for review and report. The Minister requested that the review be concluded prior to May 1992. In requesting that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade conduct the inquiry, the Minister hoped to expose the Centre's operations and performance to public scrutiny and also to help obtain a wider understanding of ACIAR's role.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To examine and report upon:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a.the effectiveness of ACIAR as an element of Australia's official development assistance program against its charter embodied in the ACIAR Act 1982;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">b.the desirability or otherwise of the continued existence of the Centre as a Statutory Authority after the expiration of twelve years of operations (June 1994), the maximum length of existence specified in the current Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The JCFADT report was tabled in April this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This document addresses the individual recommendations of the Committee, according to the order and topic groupings in which they are listed in the Committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government congratulates the Committee on its extremely thorough approach to the review. The Committee has made careful and considered recommendations on the matter of the continued existence of ACIAR and has made a number of valuable recommendations for improving ACIAR's efficiency and effectiveness in the future. Their implementation will lead to enhanced performance of ACIAR as an important element of the aid program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees with the fundamental recommendation that ACIAR continue as a statutory authority, located within the foreign affairs and trade portfolio, and that the sunset clause limiting the life of the Centre be removed. ACIAR performs an important function independently in the aid program in improving the well-being of people in developing countries and Australia through collaborative research partnerships aimed at the development of sustainable agricultural systems and the design of appropriate natural resource management strategies. ACIAR's projects mobilise Australian research expertise, thereby contributing to building research capacity both in Australia and developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees that the Centre should continue to undergo external reviews at regular intervals, as required of all statutory authorities, but considers that such reviews should be conducted by appropriate persons selected at the time of review and with the objectives of the review in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommended that the role of sunset clauses for statutory authorities be investigated by the appropriate Parliamentary Committee. The Government notes this recommendation and suggests it would be appropriate for the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to draw the matter to the attention of the Presiding Officers of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees that ACIAR's functions and mandate should be expanded further to include responsibility for the administration and disbursement of funds to the International Agricultural Research Centres, the conduct of project-related training and administration of the relevant training scheme and funds, and the carrying out of modest project-related development activities where practicable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee made two recommendations concerning the Centre's governing bodies. The Government agrees with the Committee's recommendation that ACIAR's Policy Advisory Council be reduced in size, but considers it to be important that, in its advisory capacity, the Council have a substantial number of members from countries other than Australia. The Government also considers that ACIAR's Board should be a five-member board which need not necessarily have AIDAB representation.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee made several recommendations concerning, or with implication for, funding within the aid program, namely an increase in ACIAR's budget to 3.5% of the aid budget by 1997, an increase in core funding for the International Agricultural Research Centres (IARCs) to 1.5 of ODA by 1997, and the creation of an establishment along the same lines as ACIAR with responsibility for research and development assistance in areas including manufacturing systems and human resource development. The Government considers that ACIAR's performance and the importance of the IARCs' programs warrant a reconsideration of their funding priority within the aid budget. Further consideration to a body similar to ACIAR to deal with non-agricultural sectors will be given.</PARA>

It is recognised, however, that this will vary from country to country, institution to institution and project to project, having regard to the level of science and technicality in projects and the internal capacity of the partner country institutions.

<PARA>On many occasions Reserve Bank reports have provided an insight into a different level, nature and style of official advice which is given to the Government. It is unfortunate that ever since Mr John Phillips appeared to take a considerable role in the preparation of reports a couple of years ago, the Reserve Bank annual reports have tended to echo much more the evident attitudes of the Government rather than express what one would have hoped might have been strongly individual views or a strongly independent view of the monetary authorities. </PARA>

I would have thought that at the moment it would be very difficult to find a unanimity of view about the level of the present Government's incompetence. Certainly, there is a widespread view that it is incompetent, that its management of the economy has been monumentally incompetent. It is curious to find that the Reserve Bank, apparently, has very little disagreement with anything that has been done by the Government in leading this nation into the most appalling, disastrous and largely unnecessary recession. This recession has been influenced to only a relatively small extent by external factors, unlike the 1982-83 recession which was basically drought driven. The Reserve Bank deals with that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report the Reserve Bank says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1988 and early in 1989, a strong world economy and buoyant terms of trade underpinned an excessive rate of domestic spending.</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose it is all very well for the Reserve Bank to say that now. But what was the Reserve Bank doing at the time; what was Government policy at the time? The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . policy has been pursued with an eye to the implication for activity and employment, as well as the need to achieve a breakthrough in perceptions about inflation.</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose the million unemployed could wonder whether the eye of the Reserve Bank is like that of Nelson's because it certainly has a blind eye on the question of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reserve Bank mentions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Real interest rates as conventionally measured have remained relatively high throughout the downturn, suggesting a firm monetary policy.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that real interest rates have remained high and maybe this is one reason that there has been such a very slow recovery from recession. The bank notes in its report that there has been a reluctance on the part of corporations to extend their indebtedness. It may well be, of course, a reluctance by the banks to extend credit. But the continuing very high level of real interest rates clearly is a factor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note, too, in the context of the Victorian State election that the bank recognises that there have been different economic results in different States. The bank notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effects of falling asset prices and the associated impacts on financial stability and confidence were concentrated most heavily in those areas which had become most overextended. Victoria (and more lately South Australia) suffered the worst falls on most measures of economic activity. . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is significant, as the Reserve Bank said, that Victoria and South Australia became the most overextended States. It is interesting to note that the State banks in both those States played a key role in that overextension. The State banks, under the policy directions of their Labor State governments, have played a key role in the disasters from which these two States are now suffering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the Reserve Bank in effect underlines in its comment almost the culpability of the Victorian State Government, which owned the Victorian State Bank&mdash;this also applies in the case of the South Australian Government. This led to a ludicrous situation in which Victoria became overextended and, as a result, it is now suffering the most. I hope that the Victorian electorate recognises the role that its State Government played in this overextension as a result of which it is now suffering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bank also says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An early return to a solid rate of growth is not inconsistent with the maintenance of low underlying inflation. Indeed, employment growth needs to be restored promptly. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know that the Budget is going to do that. All we see in the Budget is in fact an absence of any major, or even minor, programs that will encourage the generation of real and lasting private sector jobs, and this is the only place which can provide genuine increases in employment. So it appears that, despite the Reserve Bank's enthusiastic remarks about employment growth needing to be restored promptly, this Government is doing nothing about it except creating temporary jobs paid for not by the taxpayer but as a result of increasing debt&mdash;paid for on Bankcard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of the dramatic differences between the nonsense of the Government's approach and the sorts of genuine assistance and encouragement for the private sector which are contained in the Opposition's Fightback policy, which takes taxes off business, helps generate jobs in the private sector and provides a real solution to Australia's problems. The One Nation package is now a clear failure. Mr Hawke, the former Prime Minister, quite properly identified it as containing such ludicrous forecasts and statements of expectation that it has in fact damaged the Government's credibility. Mr Hawke, of course, is quite right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one thing the Reserve Bank has stressed that I think is very important and that is the difference between this recession and the 1982-83 recession. We keep hearing from economic imbeciles on the other side&mdash;from the front bench in particular&mdash;who try to pretend that somehow things were worse in 1982-83 and that their problems are all because of what happened then. The Reserve Bank makes a very significant statement about this. It points out that the major recession in the early 1980s `had been exacerbated by the effect of drought on rural output'. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contraction in the non-farm economy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, in the current recession&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">on the other hand, appears to have been larger than in 1982-83.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us get this clear: the Reserve Bank acknowledges that the fall in the non-farm economy in this recession has been larger than in 1982-83. In other words, this Government has managed to do this without the savage impact of drought which, of course, decimated the Australian economy in 1982-83. Let us hear no more of these nonsensical comparisons, because the Reserve Bank is demonstrating that the Labor Party has simply been misleading the people of Australia on this score. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fall in aggregate employment was similar in the two episodes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>both in 1982-83 and in this recession the fall in aggregate employment has been similar, despite the fact that in 1982-83 there was the massive impact of drought&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">with employment declining by 2 3/4 per cent between mid 1990 and the end of 1991, but the latest cycle has been more protracted&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, than in 1982-83&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and full-time employment noticeably weaker.</PARA>
<PARA>So this recession, on the Reserve Bank's evidence, is deeper, more protracted and worse than the 1982-83 recession. It is about time those sitting on the Government front bench recognised the reality and stopped spreading the Labor lie that somehow things were worse in 1982-83. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suggest that before the Minister keeps reiterating the word `rubbish', he should go away and, if he can understand the Reserve Bank, apply what is left of his mind to it. The Reserve Bank made another interesting point about another damaging impact of this incompetent Government on the economy. This might have slipped through to the keeper. It had not struck me quite as forcefully as it appears to strike the Reserve Bank. It notes that one of the reasons for this instability and these problems in the economy is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A period of political instability around the turn of the year added to general uncertainty about both short-term economic prospects and the stance of policy.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a polite way of saying that the Keating coup was another bit of icing on the cake of his contribution to the destruction of the Australian economy, and that that coup helped damage the economic recovery. I suppose it is only a drop in the bucket of the disasters that Mr Keating has brought to this nation, but it is certainly worth recognising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had also failed to pick up, until the Reserve Bank report did so, that the increase in consumer demand for retail goods, which rose in the June quarter, was largely a recovery brought about by this Government by handing out loot. In other words, it can fiddle the national income figures with taxpayers' money just as it can fiddle the unemployment figures, and it has been doing both. The Reserve Bank says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consumer demand for retail goods. . . rose further in the June quarter, helped by the one-off supplementary payment to families in April.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have a situation where, clearly, if a government puts its mind to it, like this Government, it can fiddle the consumer demand element of the national income figures by paying out taxpayers' money, or borrowed money&mdash;which has now been demonstrated because of the huge size of the deficit&mdash;to fiddle the accounts. It means that one must take the national income figures with even larger grains of salt when the Government quotes national income figures to demonstrate economic recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I want to make refers to the Reserve Bank's comments on the balance of payments. It points out that the net income deficit declined to $15.7 billion, down from $18 billion, in 1991. But then it reveals something else that I must admit I had not noted sufficiently well, that is, that this fall reflected a decline in the cost of servicing foreign liabilities mainly as a result of lower interest rates on foreign debt. It notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the year to March 1992, the annual interest burden represented around 17 per cent of the value of exports of goods and services, around 3 percentage points lower than two years earlier.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there does not appear to be a fundamental basic improvement in the balance of payments at all. On the contrary, it is simply because of lower external interest rates that the cost of servicing our debt diminished. That eased the burden and gave the false appearance of things being an awful lot better, and that the Government was somehow doing something to fix up the balance of payments crisis that Australia is in. It is simply not true. It is another indicator that does not really indicate that things are getting better at all. It certainly does not indicate that this Government is doing anything to improve the situation. As the Australian dollar falls, the servicing costs will increase, and I notice that in the Budget Papers there is a clear indication that the current account balance will worsen yet again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point that I want to make relates to another element of the Reserve Bank's annual report. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To recover from the recession without a permanently higher level of unemployment, but with the external accounts structurally improving and inflation low, is a considerable challenge.</PARA>
<PARA>It sure is, because the Budget Papers themselves show that external accounts are going to get worse this year and that there will be a permanently high level of unemployment. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minimising the fallout of the recession on the labour market will require balanced macro-economic policies, acting on the demand side of the economy. It will also require further micro-economic policies aimed at increasing flexibility on the supply side. In particular, successful competition in the international market place ultimately requires a highly skilled and adaptable labour force.</PARA>
<PARA>What is the Government doing about these vital objectives that the Reserve Bank says must be achieved? I guess we could say that it is trying to improve the skill levels and the adaptability of a labour force, because it is trying to increase the numbers of people who are unemployed who are able to pick up skill levels. To that extent, I suppose we could say, `For heaven's sake, at least the Government has recognised part of the problem'. But it has not recognised what the Reserve Bank points out first&mdash;that we have to have balanced macro-economic policies acting on the demand side of the economy and, further, micro-economic policies aimed at increasing flexibility on the supply side. What is the Government doing in these areas?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that my colleague Senator Short, who will be following me, will demonstrate that this Government has really done nothing in terms of any micro-economic policies on the supply side and is doing very little in terms of macro-economic policies on the demand side. It would be useful if the Government, instead of sneering at the Fightback package, had a good look at the positive measures that can be taken to fix this disaster that we are now putting up with in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reserve Bank notes that there are problems with the public sector borrowing requirement. It says that the current financial situation `will make it more difficult to wind back the PSBR than in the 1980s, as well as limiting the scope for further discretionary increases in spending or cuts in taxes'. Here we have the Reserve Bank saying that the economic situation will limit the scope for further discretionary increases in government spending and this Government is, in fact, increasing government spending by borrowing&mdash;unfunded schemes and a massive deficit. The report then says that it will also be more difficult to introduce cuts in taxes, yet the Government says that it is going to proceed with cuts in taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the two issues where the Reserve Bank says `There would be great difficulties in going down that track', the Government is going down those very tracks. It is going to cut taxes, even if it has to increase taxes to pay for the cut taxes. That is a rough translation of what Mr Dawkins said in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Reserve Bank's annual report is not as clearly a source of different, independent advice to the Parliament and to the Government as one has seen in the past, it does, nevertheless, reveal some clear failures of this Government. It clearly indicates that the Government is not undertaking a course that appears&mdash;if one reads between the lines of the Reserve Bank's report&mdash;to be one that the Reserve Bank would favour in some instances. The report clearly indicates that the present disaster in Victoria, for example, is directly attributable to the sorts of policies that allowed the financial institutions controlled by the governments in Victoria and South Australia to over-extend themselves and to over-expand. For all that, the Reserve Bank report is a useful document, but it would be nice to see it more of an independent one in terms of its general policy thrust and advice than it appears to be at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extraordinary that, in this time of crisis, there appears to be, at least on the surface, a sort of unanimity of policy advice between the Treasury and the Reserve Bank&mdash;if in fact statement No. 2 is the Treasury's statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say a few words about this report, and endorse the comments made by my friend and colleague Senator Michael Baume. I want to touch on two main aspects of the bank's report. Firstly, I would like to point out that net profits made under the Reserve Bank Act&mdash;profits which basically relate to the activities of the bank&mdash;amounted to $2.6 billion in 1991-92. This was approximately $1 billion up on the amount of $1.6 billion&mdash;or near enough to it&mdash;in the preceding financial year of 1990-91. I would also like to make the point that those profits have been appropriated essentially to the Commonwealth Government. That $2.6 billion was very important in enabling the Government to produce a Budget deficit for this year of $13.4 billion instead of the much higher underlying deficit that really exists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has published in the Budget the figure of $13.4 billion as its bottom line deficit. The true deficit is, in fact, closer to $20 billion. Indeed, it is $20.5 billion. The most important single element in bridging the gap between that $13.4 billion and $20.5 billion&mdash;namely, $7.1 billion&mdash;is the very large Reserve Bank profit of $2.6 billion. It is not a cooking of the books by the Commonwealth Government in terms of its Budget formulation; nevertheless, if we are making an accurate assessment of the Government's true budgetary position, that figure should be set aside. Therefore, the Reserve Bank has once again, as it did last year, made a significant contribution towards allowing the Government to publish a much lower Budget deficit figure than the true figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the published figure is already horrendously high at $13.4 billion. That is something like 40 or 50 per cent higher than the far too high $9.3 billion deficit last year, which was, in itself, one of the important contributing factors in the continuing growth in the tragic level of unemployment in Australia. That deficit was also the reason for the level of economic growth&mdash;particularly in the private sector&mdash;being much less than it should have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point I want to make about the Reserve Bank's annual report&mdash;and in this I endorse the comments of Senator Baume&mdash;is that there is an eerie similarity this year between the assessments of the bank and the assessments of the Treasury about the economic situation and the prospects for the future. Like Senator Baume, I would like to see a more full-blooded and independent assessment by the bank of the economic situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bank has had a very proud record of objectivity over many years&mdash;for most of the past years, anyway&mdash;in terms of its analysis and the frankness with which it publishes material. Senator Baume referred to the era when Mr Phillips was the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank. There have been previous occasions when, under Governors such as Bob Johnston, Harry Knight and Jock Phillips&mdash;as well as some of those other great Governors of the Reserve Bank&mdash;the bank was fearless in the advice that it provided to government and to the wider community. I detect a lessening of that in recent years. </PARA>

It is extremely important that the Reserve Bank, as the central bank of this nation, is not only independent and fearless in the advice it gives to government and in the information it publishes for the community but also is seen to be independent. I hope that that situation of apparent independence, which I think has lessened in recent years, will be restored because it is of very considerable importance.

<PARA>That statement would have to err, if anything, on the optimistic side. I do not know that there has really been any recovery at all in the economy. The national accounts figures show very halting growth. Much of the anecdotal evidence that is available to us indicates that in most major segments of the economy there has been no recovery, but a continuing deep recession and continuing major lay-offs of people in jobs. So `recovery' is a word that ought to be used very cautiously. The words of much greater significance are that any action or development that has occurred has been very weak overall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reserve Bank is less than fulsome in its views about the prospects for the next 12 months. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the next 12 months, subject as always to developments abroad and policies at home, the prospects are for a faster pace of growth.</PARA>
<PARA>That really is not saying too much at all, given the snail's pace at best that we have had in the past 12 months. Indeed, it has caused unemployment to continue to escalate in Australia to more than 11 per cent. In the Government's own Estimates published in the Budget only two days ago, the Government forecasts that the average rate of unemployment in this current financial year of 1992-93 will be 10.5 per cent, which is higher than the figure for 1991-92 on average of 10.4 per cent. So the Government itself is admitting that the average level of unemployment this current financial year will be even higher than the average level of unemployment in the last financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a statement by the Government in the Budget that there is an expectation that over the course of the next 12 months unemployment will fall to below 10 per cent. But it is talking about a fall of about one per cent in the unemployment rate, achieved at a very great cost through a massive pump-priming spending spree designed to try to get the Government over the line at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There should be no doubt at all about the motivation for the structuring of this year's Budget. It is a Budget simply designed to try to buy votes to get this desperate Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and this desperate Government re-elected at the next election. It has gone down like a lead balloon, both in the financial markets and in the general community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the next few days we will see the decisions in the Budget sink without trace. Instead, we will be left with a massive tax threat hanging over the head of every Australian because even the Government was forced to acknowledge in the Budget that it will almost certainly not be able to balance its books by the mid-1990s unless it imposes savage increases in existing taxes and/or imposes new taxes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It acknowledges that it will not be able to balance its books by 1995-96 on all reasonable expectations unless it increases the level of taxation. There is no way that the taxes that it nominates for increase, namely, fringe benefits, withholding and prescribed payments&mdash;as Senator Cook should know but obviously does not&mdash;can provide the necessary increase in revenue to fill the void unless the Government savagely increases those taxes. Even then, the Government probably would not make it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The certainty would be that if the Government were re-elected, it would finish up with a goods and services tax in the next couple of years. This would happen without any of the offsetting tax cuts, the $13 billion of tax cuts in personal income tax, the $20 billion of cuts in the taxes that are so onerous on business in Australia today&mdash;none of the generous compensation measures and provisions contained in the coalition's Fightback proposals to go with the major restructuring of the taxation system of which the goods and services tax is only one part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this Government is re-elected, which will not happen, there is no doubt that there would be a savage increase in the total level of taxation over the next few years. That is obvious, given the amount by which it is putting itself into hock. This year the financing requirement of the Government will be $18.5 billion. That is the amount of money it has to find out in the money markets either here or abroad, simply to meet the extent to which its expenditure this year will exceed its revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That puts the Government into increasing hock. It means that the public interest payments&mdash;the interest bill that has to be met by taxpayers this year&mdash;will go up by 26 per cent, to quote the Government's own figures. Next year, it will go up by 33 per cent. Even the year after, it will go up by another 15 per cent. All of that has to be paid for out of taxpayers' funds even before one starts to pay off one cent of the actual massive increases in borrowing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the next three or four years, we will see a cumulative deficit in this country of a figure which could well approach $50 billion. The Reserve Bank's report talks about the size of deficits. It does not express quite the degree of concern that I certainly would have about the deficit over the past couple of years. It does make a statement that is important because it conflicts completely with the actual situation that we will face in this country. It says that for a variety of reasons, `temporary large deficits do not themselves pose a serious problem'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point to be made about that is that the deficit that we face as a nation in the Commonwealth Budget accounts is not temporary. It is an enormous deficit of an ongoing nature which the Government itself has acknowledged will continue well into the 1990s. That imposes structural constraints on the economy which are highly detrimental to the growth in GDP, investment, savings and, therefore, unemployment. The whole policy approach enshrined in the Budget of two days ago is a policy approach which is absolutely contrary to the requirements of this nation if we really do want to get back and be a dynamic, growing, job creating nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same section of the annual report the Reserve Bank says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Looking further ahead, the economy still faces a considerable adjustment task over the next several years.</PARA>
<PARA>That would have to be the understatement of the year. As Senator Baume said in his remarks, to date no adjustment has been undertaken. That is the reason why this nation is in its present dreadful mess, with its tragic level of unemployment, desperately low growth, and an abysmally low level of savings and investment. If it is said that the economy still faces a considerable adjustment task over the next several years, all I can say to that is, it sure does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The longer that the adjustment task is delayed, the more intractable that problem will become and the more deep-seated our fundamental underlying problems will be. The bank says&mdash;and it is wrong here&mdash;`some progress has been made in the balance of payments area'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year's Budget forecast was for a balance of payments deficit on current account of $15 billion compared with $11.9 billion in the year just ended. That $15 billion deficit is probably optimistic because it is based on what I think can reasonably be described as an optimistic forecast for the growth in exports, given the uncertain situation that faces us in the major export markets that we rely on. Sixty per cent of our exports go to the Asian region, of which Japan is a very important part. The Japanese economy, as we all know, is pretty rocky at the moment and has some considerable problems of adjustment ahead. That will have an impact throughout the Asian region, and some of the individual major countries in the Asian region are undergoing their own readjustment problems, with lower growth rates than they have had in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without being too pessimistic, if we were to make a more reasonable assessment about the prospects for Australian export growth over the next 12 months, I think it would be reasonable to assume that the balance of payments deficit now forecast of $15 billion could end up being closer to $17 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also says that the lower inflation environment can only be good for overall savings performance and for the process of allocation of these savings. I agree with that in theory. In practical terms though, we now have almost the lowest level of savings as a nation that we have had certainly in living memory. One of the essential reasons for that is that the Government, through its budgetary policy, has been drawing on the nation's savings at an unprecedented rate. While I agree with the bank in its report that a positive overall savings performance is what is needed&mdash;of course it is&mdash;if the Government were to believe that, it would be taking steps through its Budget policy and other policy measures to ensure that it encouraged that performance rather than, as it is in fact doing, detracting from it very severely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public sector borrowing requirement, to which I think Senator Baume referred in his comments about the bank's report, is a fundamental problem for us at the moment. There has been a turnaround in the public sector borrowing requirement as a proportion of gross domestic product of no less than 7 per cent in the past three years. So far as I am aware, never in our history have we had a turnaround and deterioration of the public borrowing situation of that magnitude. This year will compound the problem even further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reading very carefully between the lines of the report's assessment of the prospects ahead for the economy, I think the bank is really pointing the way quietly&mdash;and I would have liked to see it come out more forcefully in the report&mdash;to several major fundamental problems that underlie the prospect ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sooner we get on with the task of restructuring this economy, tackling the real areas of great need&mdash;reform of the taxation system, as well as of the industrial relations system, shipping, transport systems, the telecommunications system, the power generation system&mdash;all those key so-called infrastructure industries which determine very importantly the level of productivity overall for our economy, the better. The longer we delay in undertaking the necessary reforms in those areas, the longer we will be condemned to a decade of low growth in the economy, low investment, low savings and&mdash;as I have said and as has been said all too often&mdash;a tragically high level of continuing unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a prospect that we as a nation, with all the potential advantages and attractions we have, should not allow to continue. The sooner a change of government occurs in this country, with the present Government succeeded by a government which is absolutely committed to achieving those reforms and changes, the better it will be for us all. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The report is interesting because the tobacco industry is in a state of flux. I note the comment that Mr Arthur Graham, Chairman of the Advisory Committee, has made on page 5 of the report, where he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The value of the Australian dollar has shown remarkable resilience despite the adverse economic climate in Australia in recent years. While the advantage to the growing sector of a depreciation of the Australian dollar is obvious, any sustained appreciation would only compound the challenge of trading without any market regulation and the continuing decline in tariff protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great problems the tobacco industry faces is that it is competing against countries where there is no free float of the currency. In fact, one of the major competitors of the Australian producers is Zimbabwe. That country principally has one cash crop, and that is tobacco leaf. The consequence is that every time growers in Australia or the United States become competitive with the growers in Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe devalues its currency. Zimbabwe then can still get good returns in soft currency, but of course it drags down the price that it is fetching on the world market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem for us is that we do not devalue our currency every time we want to give a boost to the cash crop. In fact, some people would say that the currency at the moment is far too high. The great challenge for the Australian industry is how to compete with this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the figures in the Budget and from the portfolio profile of our foreign denominated debt, it seems very clear that Treasury expects the Australian dollar to appreciate against the US dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a real challenge because this year tobacco growers in Zimbabwe are selling their leaf for prices denominated in US dollars. So if the Australian dollar increases against the greenback, the consequence will be that, even if the price of tobacco leaf as sold in Zimbabwe stays the same, it would come in here much cheaper. Of course, the other problem is that Zimbabwe could well do a devaluation of the sort of magnitude we saw at the end of last season, which would throw huge amounts of leaf, sold at well under what is a realistic price, into the market and wipe out Australian growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This industry has a net value of leaf of about $80m, which does not seem like a lot. Of that, $47m worth is grown within almost a stone's throw of where I live on the Atherton Tablelands, so of course it is a major concern for me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that it is almost inevitable that tariffs in the tobacco industry will come down&mdash;although it does not really make much of a substantial impact on prices&mdash;I believe that we should take a serious look at the definitions of `dumping' and `countervailing'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although neither a dumping action nor a countervailing action should be used as a form of non-tariff protection, we have to be very aware that some countries do not have a clean float of their currency. We also have to be aware that, if we express the prices in perhaps the black market price for their currency rather than the official price, there is de facto dumping of the goods into the international market&mdash;and, most importantly, dumping of the goods into the Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at possible dumping we should be looking at expressing the price at which it is sold in the parallel marketplace for that crop rather than the official exchange rate in the country in question. If we did that, we would really wipe out the advantage in terms of selling into Australia that countries such as Zimbabwe had last year by their dirty devaluation. All I am asking is for the Government to go away and look at this problem. It is a very real problem&mdash;not just from Zimbabwe but from many other East African countries&mdash;which will remain with us until we take some positive steps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question I put to the Senate is: whether one smokes or not, does one want to throw away a $80m industry and deprive a town like Mareeba of $47m of income in the next financial year?

In speaking to this report, I want to respond to an attack on the integrity of the Institute and its past Director of Research, Dr Paul Wilson, by Senator Harradine in speaking to this document during the last session. I believe it was actually in March, but it has taken a long time to reach the top of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reference to the annual report of the Institute, Senator Harradine attempted to show that there had been some impropriety regarding the Institute's payment of $3,618 towards the cost of bringing a Danish criminologist, Dr Berl Kutchinsky, to Australia to speak at the Institute's Conference on the Sex Industry and Public Policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine's objections seemed to focus on the fact that Professor Kutchinsky's findings that there had been a 30 per cent decrease in sex crimes in three European countries since the legalisation of adult erotica were opposed to his personal beliefs that non-violent adult sexual depictions lead otherwise normal human beings to rape or even to kill. I attended that conference and recall that Professor Kutchinsky's contribution was very well received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine quoted Dr John Court and Dr Judith Reisman as criticising Kutchinsky's research and therefore calling into question his suitability to address the conference. I would like to inform the Senate of what the British Royal Commission on Pornography had to say about Dr Court. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We reject his&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is Court's&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">evidence and to the extent that they rely on it, those who quote him.</PARA>
<PARA>From my own experience of Dr Court's published work, I would concur with the Commission's view. Senator Harradine also claimed that the Institute had failed to invite any of Dr Kutchinsky's critics to debate his findings. That puzzles me and perhaps Senator Harradine has begun to re-evaluate his traditional allies, because both the Reverend Fred Nile and Senator Shirley Walters attended the conference, and it is my recollection that both were invited speakers. Senator Harradine also claimed that the selection of funded speakers was made solely by Dr Wilson. This is incorrect as all speakers were approved by the Director of the Institute who was kept informed through all stages of the preparation and the conference itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Kutchinsky's work was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">International Journal of Law and Psychiatry</EMPHASIS> where it was of course peer reviewed and should therefore be beyond reproach. It was also extensively quoted and praised throughout the Williams Commission. I will seek leave to incorporate the conclusion of Dr Kutchinsky's contribution. I regret that the contribution itself is too long and not in a suitable form to incorporate. I will also seek leave to incorporate a letter from the coordinator of the largest file on sex crime in the world in Michigan in the United States, who says that he can demonstrate a stronger correlation between sex crimes and alcohol than he can between sex crimes and sexual depictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research like Kutchinsky's answers narrow-minded and prejudiced calls for prohibition and censorship of a wide range of material made by Senator Harradine and his supporters. I personally wish that those who favour prohibition would focus on areas such as extreme violence and extreme sexism which, from current research, have been shown to be more likely to cause harm and offence in the community than the non-violent depiction of human sexuality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the work of the Institute of Criminology, as I have before, for its research and for the opportunity it provides through conferences and seminars, such as the one Senator Harradine attacked and the more recent one on homicide, which I also attended and which enabled informed debate on issues that should concern us all. I condemn the Opposition who are happy to distort Institute research results for their own purposes, for example, in their recent leaflet on violent crime and the aged. I believe the Opposition proposes to axe the Institute itself as part of the Fightback package. I seek leave to incorporate the material I referred to. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aggregate data on rape and other violent or sexual offenses from four countries where pornography, including aggressive varieties, has become widely and easily available during the period we have dealt with would seem to exclude, beyond any reasonable doubt, that this availability has had any detrimental effects in the form of increased sexual violence. Especially the data from West Germany are striking since here the only increase in the sexual violence takes place in the form which includes the least serious forms of sexual coercion and where there may have been increases in reporting frequency. As far as the other forms of sexual violence are concerned, the remarkable fact is that they decreased&mdash;the more so, the more serious the offense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The finding is not so strange. Most other research data we have about pornography and rape suggest that the link between them is more than weak. And our knowledge about the contents, the uses and the users of pornography suggests that pornography does not represent a blueprint for rape, but is essentially an aphrodisiac, that is, food for the sexual fantasy of persons&mdash;mostly males&mdash;who like to masturbate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy implications of this conclusion are, of course open to debate. But as mentioned earlier, the mainstream attitude would seem to be a combination of two movements; (1) To reduce the area of total prohibition and censorship to a minimum, and (2) to implement a variety of restrictions, suitable of each form of pornography, in order to obtain maximum protection of children, and of adults who want no confrontation with the material.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My office has received an order request from the Michigan State Police study on pornography and it's impact on sex motivated crime. This is truly the most distant request we have ever received. For several years I have responded to requests from all over the United States and Canada. This study was allegedly conducted by a former member of this Unit and presented in various public forums. Since his retirement, several attempts were made to locate this study. After years of investigation, the truth is that no such study was ever conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The promise of the study was supposed to show that pornography causes sexual assault. Anyone who has ever studied human behaviour knows that this is extremely difficult, if not impossible to say that one things causes certain behaviour. The best one can show is a correlation. The Michigan State Police maintain the largest computerized sex motivated crime file in the world. This file was initiated in 1955 and continues to be present, with almost 75,000 cases on file. The information that we can glean from these reports is greater today than during the time that this study was allegedly conducted. I have attempted to replicate the information that was being offered about pornography. There is insufficient data to indicate anything other than a weak correlation between pornography and sexual assault, and even less information to suggest that pornography was used prior to or during sexual assault.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the criminal personality profiler for the Michigan State Police, I can offer that pornography is used to enhance sexual fantasy and for arousal. That this material would cause one to work themself up into a frenzy and then commit a sexual assault would be a giant leap indeed. In fact, one of the most popular magazines in prison amongst child molesters is the J.C. Penney catalog (retail store), because it features young boys and girls in their underwear.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again the Senate is presented with a report courtesy of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, NBEET, which, thankfully, will be abolished after the coalition comes into government at the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As NBEET is one of the most prolific producers of asinine reports in the Public Service system, it was with some relief that I read this report and discovered that it is actually looking at a very useful issue and had some very useful comments on HECs and educational profiles. Needless to say, the opinions expressed by the Higher Education Council through NBEET are just a continuation of the sort of rhetoric that we have come to expect from this organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A perfect example from the report is that NBEET states that `There is strong support for the profiling process'. This opinion has been obtained by going around the various universities and asking them if they approve of it. This is not a very sound method of assessing the feelings for the education profile process or anything else. No university vice-chancellor is about to bite the hand that feeds the university. When the report says, `There is generally strong support for the profiles process overall', the praise seems to have a somewhat hollow ring to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have moved around universities in Australia and talked to senior staff, this is not what they are telling me. They see it as a huge imposition and a drain on their resources. I noted in visitations to various educational institutions by the Higher Education Council that they were not meeting with staff. The question immediately arises, therefore, as to how accurate their claim of general acceptance of the profiling process actually is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main groups affected is academic staff, and they were not given an opportunity to express their opinion. Staff are particularly affected by the profiling process and suffer significantly under the bureaucratic nightmare established by the bane of Australian education, Mr Dawkins. Data collection and educational profiles are an extreme waste of time and resources. Staff are often subject to tedious bureaucratic data collection when time is desperately needed in other areas of their work. It is no wonder that the education sector in Australia is unable to attract and keep a lot of academic brilliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Data collected is often refined to such an extent that comparisons between institutions are not possible. Changes in criteria often increase the time taken by staff to collect data. As this report states, some comments were received that more data was collected than was used. Questions were raised in this report regarding the quantum, manageability and usefulness of data collected through the profiling process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another criticism examined by the report is the legislative basis of the profiling process. The legislation governing the process does not indicate the purpose to which the profiles can be put or limit the content, and there is no opportunity for public scrutiny of the profiling arrangements. This leaves open the way for the process to become increasingly regulatory in character.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report dismisses these concerns as it considers that the process is open and subject to multiple levels of scrutiny. All these levels of scrutiny are from within. The only external scrutiny received is through the Parliament, and the decisions for negotiations and advice from HECs are tabled. This is not adequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the need for higher education institutions to comply with the profiling process in order to obtain funds, constantly in fear of failing to meet the Government's hidden agenda, is a major threat to institutional autonomy. How can universities operate with autonomy and determine their own academic agenda without undue influence, when this agenda is subjected to such a high level of scrutiny by government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report concludes that the education profiling process is working well and that it is generally accepted by the institutions. I reject this proposition. Our higher education institutions are restricted in what they can do by the dictates of this Government's policy, and the resources wasted on putting together institutional profiles could be put to infinitely better use.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to say a few words about the report on the state of the automotive industry which was produced by the Automotive Industry Authority. It says a number of interesting things about the state of the industry and where it is heading in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the seventh report by the Automotive Industry Authority, whose principal functions are: firstly, to encourage the industry to develop in a way consistent with the policy of the Commonwealth Government; secondly, to promote change within the industry directed at improving its efficiency; thirdly, to monitor the performance and outlook for the industry; and, fourthly, to provide information and advice on the industry to government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that three challenges face the car industry in the run-up to the year 2000. The first is the reduction of tariffs to 15 per cent by the year 2000. The increase in automation, which will improve productivity but which will have a detrimental impact on the number of jobs, is really a second major challenge that the industry must face, and one that must be recognised by the public and government when seeking to increase job prospects in the industry in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, a change in consumer demands will clearly impact on the kind of product that the industry will produce. The environmental concerns expressed by consumers through their purchasing power will, in the long term, affect the car industry in a very real way. That is a challenge that the car industry in Australia must face if it is going to retain a viable industry into the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tariffs have been substantially reduced already from 57.5 per cent in 1984 to 35 per cent to date, and will be reduced to 15 per cent by the year 2000 under the Button car plan. The Government is using this strategy to force the car industry to make improvements in price, quality and efficiency. It has certainly been a very effective tool, if that has been its major goal. The reduction in tariffs in the eyes of many has resulted already in the closure of one car factory and the loss of many thousands of jobs with Nissan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really impress upon the Government how poorly regarded within the industry the tariff policy is. One would not find one person in the car industry at the moment who welcomes and embraces the Government's car tariff policy, especially given the very tight economic circumstances surrounding the economy and the car industry as a whole. Many are really wondering whether it is this Government's intention to simply kill off the car industry altogether by its headlong rush into lower tariffs. Certainly the car industry has made every effort to meet that challenge, but it is a real struggle and, certainly in the current economic situation, it would welcome a 12-month pause in the tariff phase-down, which would help it to restructure in this time of economic stress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our view, the key to a successful car industry is improved productivity, innovation and meeting the needs of customers. Interestingly enough, this report states several times that one means of improving productivity is to increase investment in automation and advanced manufacturing technologies. It must be remembered that automation will not result in more jobs. If anything, automation will result in fewer jobs as robotics increasingly take the place of those skilled workers who once performed those functions. The Government must be aware of that and make plans to take up those workers by way of training programs and so forth, so that they are not just left on the unemployment scrap heap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also states that the difference in productivity between Australian and overseas car companies is due to our low level of automation. I find it interesting that it is not due to restrictive work practices, as one would be led to believe by other senators in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third challenge facing the industry is changing consumer demands. I find it interesting to note that there has been a marked increase in imported small cars over the last few years, which indicates that consumers are not looking for large six-cylinder vehicles but smaller cars with fuel efficiency. This will become more important for the industry over time as the impact of the Californian emissions regulations come into effect. They will have a ripple impact throughout the car industry around the world as vehicles will be produced that will have lower emissions and will be much more fuel efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is vitally important for the Australian car industry that manufacturers and components manufacturers recognise that these developments will eventually impact on what happens here in this country. Long term plans must be made to ensure that the industry restructures. </PARA>

<PARA>In the Budget Speech of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) the other evening, at page 13 it was pointed out that, in the absence of new measures, revenues are likely to decline over the period to 1995-96. He said that if the fiscal position nearer to the time is not stronger than is now projected, the Government will consider and implement a number of tax changes to maintain the revenue structure. These changes, referred to in the Budget statements, would allow for the 1995-96 deficit to be between one-half and one per cent of gross domestic product&mdash;in other words, about $2 billion to $4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely clear from all the evidence available that the Government will be forced to implement those tax changes, those tax increases, if it is to even get anywhere near meeting its so-called promise to cut personal income tax by 1994-95 and 1995-96, as it `promised' to do in the One Nation statement in February, a promise that it reiterated in the Budget Speech the other night. It is an ironic situation, is it not, that the Government is now virtually admitting in this Budget that it will have to increase taxes over the next few years in order to give the personal income tax cuts that it had promised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big question that arises from that, and the question which I posed in the Senate today and which Dr Hewson and Mr Reith and my colleagues have been posing very strongly in the House of Representatives, is: just what will be the size of those tax increases and what new taxes will have to be introduced to meet the revenue needs that the Government says it will require?  It will require those and more unless it can do far more than it has demonstrated in the last nine years to keep its own house in order on the expenditure side. What new taxes will it introduce and why on earth will it not come clean with the Australian public and with this Parliament and give us those details?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a fundamental difference between, on the one hand, this deceitful Government, this Government that is not prepared to be honest and open with the Australian people, with the electorate, and, on the other hand, the coalition&mdash;the alternative government, the next government&mdash;which has so clearly articulated in great detail both the expenditure and the revenue proposals that a Hewson-led government will implement. Those proposals in the area of taxation are very wide ranging indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They involve a reduction averaging 30 per cent in the income tax to be paid by every Australian personal income tax payer. They include the abolition of $20 billion of taxes that are now imposed on the cost of doing business in Australia, the cost of making goods and services in Australia, the cost of employing people in Australia&mdash;taxes like the wholesale sales tax, the most inefficient, archaic indirect tax system in the world. We will abolish that. We will also abolish the tax on jobs&mdash;payroll tax. It is absolutely ridiculous that a country such as ours, with the unemployment problems that we have facing us, should tax jobs, should tax employment, by having a tax on payrolls. We will also abolish a tax which has become an absolute milch cow for this Government over the nine years it has been in office&mdash;namely, fuel excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Hawke Government came into office in 1983, fuel excise was 6c a litre; today it is 26c a litre. That money has not gone into building roads or anything to do with motorists or transport. It has gone towards feeding the insatiable demand, the insatiable diet, that this Government has for spending, spending, spending. That policy has cost Australia very dearly indeed. It has cost jobs, jobs and jobs. It has cost economic growth and it has cost investment. It has reduced savings in this nation to the lowest level in our history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will abolish the fuel excise tax completely because it is such a major burden, not only on domestic motorists but, more importantly, on the transport industry in Australia&mdash;an industry that goes to the core of virtually all areas of economic activity in this nation of ours, huge as it is in terms of land mass, so highly dependent as it is on road transport for the distribution of goods. The transport system enters into every facet of production in Australia. It is mightily burdened by that excessive fuel excise and we will abolish it. Those are the differences between this Government and the alternative government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alternative government, the coalition, the next government, has put right up-front in the Fightback proposals of last November what it will do. We have spelt it out chapter and verse; we have detailed it dollar by dollar. What does this Government do? This Government says in the Budget that it will run out of money in effect in the next few years if it is to balance its books. It is going to increase taxes, but it is not going to tell people how it will do it. It is not going to tell people which taxes it is going to increase, other than naming two or three in the Budget which would have no hope on earth of providing the necessary revenue required to balance the books. It sneaks those ones out or buries them right down at the back of the Budget Papers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is not prepared to say anything else at all about what additional tax increases will so obviously, so clearly, so indisputably, be required in the next two, three or four years if it were to be re-elected&mdash;and thank heavens that is a very unlikely prospect. But if it were re-elected, as the Government said to the Australian people on Tuesday night in the Budget, `We are going to tax you more, but we are not going to tell you how, where or how much'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We even had the deposed Prime Minister, Mr Hawke&mdash;the Prime Minister that the current Prime Minister, Paul Keating, so brutally assassinated politically last December after working on undermining his own Government for two or three years&mdash;last night saying publicly, to his credit, that the Government's proposals and forecasts were all of a nature which would make one question the bona fides of this Government in terms of where it is going and what it is doing to the Australian people. That is the bottom line of what Bob Hawke was saying last night in his well publicised comments and that is why I have brought this motion to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion notes that the Government will have to raise taxes for its unfunded personal income tax cuts promised for 1994-95. To that should be added&mdash;and it is in fact included in a notice of motion that I have on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> which was the subject of a question here in the Senate today&mdash;that it is not just to pay for the unfunded personal income tax cuts promised for 1994-95, but also to pay for the absolutely irresponsible profligate blow-out in government spending that has occurred over recent years, notably last year and even more notably and regrettably this year when there will be an increase in Commonwealth government spending of the order of $9 billion. In real terms the figure will be about $6 billion. That comes at a time when the private sector is struggling to find an economic environment in which it is able to save, invest, grow and create jobs. There has not been a more irresponsible Budget introduced into this Parliament since the Whitlam Budgets of the 1970s, and we all know what those Budgets did to the economy and this great nation of ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, on some measures, this Budget is worse than any of the Whitlam Budgets. The deterioration in the Commonwealth's budgetary situation in the last two years has been unprecedented. It well exceeds the deterioration that occurred in the years of the Whitlam Government. It is only three years ago that the Budget was in surplus to the tune of $8 billion&mdash;thanks not to this Government but to cyclical events. I must say also that at that time there was some greater expenditure constraint than is evident or available to the Government, quite obviously, today. But we had an $8 billion surplus in the Budget in 1989-90. That surplus fell to less than $2 billion in 1990-91 and was totally reversed in 1991-92 to a deficit of $9.3 billion, despite the fact that only 12 months ago, when the 1991 Budget was introduced, the deficit for the year was forecast to be $4.7 billion. That deficit forecast had to be revised four times in the course of the year and the actual outcome was $9.3 billion which was a 100 per cent error on the original forecast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently we have a deficit which is published at $13.4 billion, but when we take account of the creative accounting involved in that, the figure is really closer to $20 billion. Indeed, on my figuring, the actual underlying Budget deficit this year will be $20.5 billion. I am not alone in making that forecast. The very respected economic commentator Alan Kohler says $21 billion, I think, and another very respected economic commentator, Max Walsh, puts the figure at around the same level. So I am not on my own in making that estimate of a $20,000m hole in the Government's finances this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does that do to the economy? It does a lot of very serious things. It means that the Government has to borrow that money; it has to go out into the marketplace and find the money to fill the hole&mdash;and that is what it is going to do. If any of the Government's rhetoric about a recovery in the economy being under way is to be believed, it follows automatically that that Government borrowing requirement will thwart and chop off at the ankles any recovery in the private sector that could occur, because the private sector will be out there in the marketplace having to compete for funds for investment, for job growth and for increased production. The private sector will be out there competing with an avaricious, greedy government that is unable to control its own spending proclivities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inevitably that means either a potential major increase in interest rates, if the money is to be borrowed domestically, or, if the Government reverses its policy of recent years and goes overseas to find some of the funds required, pressure on our exchange rate and the balance of payments and an increase in the already horrendous debt that this nation owes to the rest of the world. Australia has a net debt to the rest of the world of about $150 billion. Our gross debt to the rest of the world is about $180 billion. That figure compares with only $30 billion or thereabouts when this Government came to office in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The really soft underbelly of the Australian economy has been massively exposed and damaged by the actions and policies of this Government. That underbelly is, of course, as it has been for a long time, the external account&mdash;our balance of payments, our ability to compete in the world, to be able to afford to buy what we want to buy from the rest of the world by selling to the rest of the world. We are unable to do that. Taking everything into account&mdash;goods and services and also all of the invisible items like profit flows, interest payments on accumulated debt and so on&mdash;Australia is in hock to the rest of the world again this year by an estimated $15 billion on the Government's own figures. That is a worsening of more than $3 billion on the year just gone by. Indeed, that $15 billion is an optimistic estimate; the more likely figure is about $17 billion, but I will not argue about a billion dollars here or there. The overall fact of great concern is that Australia will be going into debt to the rest of the world again this year by a figure approaching $1 1/2 billion dollars&mdash;certainly well over a billion dollars&mdash;every month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That will all be compounded by the fact that, as the decade progresses, the Government will have to find more revenue to meet the hole in its Budget. That will come from new taxes. It cannot come from anywhere else unless there are absolutely savage increases in the level of existing tax. Where will those new taxes come from? What form will they take? One can only speculate on that. It depends on whether the Socialist Left faction of Senator Bolkus&mdash;I see him coming back into the chamber&mdash;holds sway. If there were to be another Labor government, you could be as sure as eggs that a fair chunk of it would come from that hoary old Labor notion of a wealth tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A wealth tax has to be on the cards in any re-elected Labor Government because the Left is increasing in strength, as Senator Bolkus satisfyingly knows. His prospects within his own Party of getting Labor to agree to a wealth tax have increased quite startlingly and worryingly in the last couple of years. A wealth tax has to be on the cards if Senator Bolkus's faction sees the light of day in terms of overall control of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also find a big increase in tax revenue&mdash;a rip-off of taxpayers&mdash;through another old Labor favourite of bracket creep. This Government refuses to give back to taxpayers the amount it has ripped off them simply because they have paid more tax through moving into a higher tax bracket as a result of an increase in prices&mdash;that is, inflation. Bracket creep is a time-honoured device of this Government for raising revenue and, obviously, that will continue in bigger measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government is going to honour its so-called promises to provide personal income tax cuts in 1994-95 and 1995-96, there are two other sources of revenue to finance those cuts. One would have to be an increase in the taxes on business. This Government has taxed business blind over the last nine years. All the portents are that it would have to continue to do so in the next few years if it were re-elected. Of course, increased taxes on business, particularly on the cost of doing business&mdash;on the cost of producing goods and services&mdash;automatically means a tax on investment and a tax on jobs. How on earth can we expect to get job growth in this country if we continue to be saddled with a government that believes it can milk the cow of the private sector dry, and not expect it to suffer in terms of employment, profitability and investment as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final new tax that would obviously be a near certainty if this Government were re-elected would be the introduction of what Paul Keating, as the most articulate exponent ever, I think, of such a tax, pushed in 1985 before he got rolled by the trade union movement&mdash;that is, the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax or, to use our parlance, a goods and services tax. Paul Keating knows, and the Government knows, that the only long term solution to getting an efficient tax system in this country, where the burden of taxes on business is reduced and the burden of tax on individuals is reduced, therefore restoring incentive, encouragement and reward to them, is to massively restructure the tax system. That has to involve adopting a tax of the nature of a goods and services tax, which virtually every other developed country in the world has and which more than 100 other developing countries have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of the high growth countries in the world, and all the economies of the western world, have a goods and services tax to some degree. We are the laggard.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference between our proposals and what the Government will inevitably be forced to do through its goods and services tax is that our goods and services tax proposals are accompanied by massive tax reductions in other areas, as I have outlined earlier. They are also accompanied by very generous compensation measures to take account of the one-off 4 per cent price impact that would occur from the introduction of a GST. Never has there been any indication from the Government that its introduction of a GST, or a value added tax, would be accompanied by that massive restructuring. It would simply use it as a continuing milch cow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the reasons why I move this motion on behalf of the coalition. We now have a Budget before this Parliament which has to be debated over the weeks ahead which is a totally irresponsible, spend-now-pay-later Budget. `Get the few goodies now'.

For 10 long years Australians have been fed lies, misinformation and broken promises. We have had J-curves, Priority Ones, One Nations and even Budgets that were meant to bring home the bacon. We have had 17 economic statements by this Government, cumulatively achieving a legacy of gloom and hopelessness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Budgets have regularly contained Prime Minister Keating's glib one-liners and false promises about greater things that lie ahead. I remind you, Mr President, of Mr Keating's 1990 Budget Speech. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. . . the current account will markedly improve and employment will pick up. . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is what he said in 1990. This was delivered without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage recession. Today it sounds like a sick joke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prime Minister Keating, the architect of the recession `we had to have', retains no credibility at all. Australians will no longer believe the man whose Government has put nearly a million people out of work; who has bankrupted thousands of small businesses by enforcing impossibly high interest rates; and who has crushed the living standards of low and middle income earners by high taxation. This credibility problem of Mr Keating overshadows the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But first, Mr President, let me put the document in context&mdash;the Australian scene after 10 years of hard Labor. Trevor Sykes, writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> recently in an article titled `The recession we didn't have to have', presented a scathing picture of Labor's policies. He said that Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">now has one in nine of its people out of work; where regional unemployment is high enough to be labelled depression rather than recession; where a large proportion of our youth has been condemned to the dole queues for so long that they are probably permanently unemployable; where greater inequality of income exists than ever before in Australian history; and where large sections of Australian manufacturing industry have been dismantled.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, what a sad legacy; what a tragedy for Australia. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures do not lie. Under Labor, per capita real income has fallen to 6 per cent below the OECD average. That is the Kelty contribution to productivity in this country. As a trading nation, we continue to slip. We are now nineteenth in terms of our share of exports. And, of course, our foreign debt stands at a massive $144 billion&mdash;up from $40 billion when Labor came to office; an increase of over $100 billion in just 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just look for a moment at the worst manifestation of Paul Keating's incompetent economic management, and that is unemployment. Unemployment rates are around 11 per cent, the highest since the Great Depression. When we add the underemployed, those who have given up, those who have been forced on to training schemes who actually want to work, the figure is, of course, substantially higher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Youth unemployment at somewhere around 35 per cent, and in some places even higher, is a calamity. Even more serious than youth unemployment is the picture for the long term unemployed. Long term unemployment is projected to reach 300,000 in 1994 from 190,000 in 1993. Further, 680,000 Australian children are now living in families where neither parent has a job. One in six Australian children aged 14 or under have no family breadwinner with a job. Seventy-five thousand Australian children are now on the street. Remember the promise&mdash;no Australian child will live in poverty? We do not just have a financial crisis in this country; we have a massive social crisis as well. And this Government has the nerve to refer to itself as a `caring government'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that appalling background, what Australians had a right to expect was a government which addressed the need for sustainable job creation and, linked to that, an economic framework within which business might be more competitive and, thus, encouraged to rebuild and employ. On both counts Mr Keating has again unambiguously failed the Australian people. The massive spending in this Budget of Whitlamesque proportions is being directed towards rectifying the political effects of inappropriate economic policies rather than the fundamental causes of our economic malaise. Instead of embracing a comprehensive program of major economic reform, as the coalition has done in Fightback, to address honestly Australia's serious problems, the Labor Party is applying a bandaid to the consequences of its policy failures&mdash;that is, unacceptable levels of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two statistics in this Budget which demonstrate its failure in stark terms. The first is that the current account deficit is expected to rise from $11.9 billion last year to $15 billion this year. The second is that the Budget forecasts yet another fall in business investment. In other words, despite all the pain Australians have had to suffer under Labor, we remain uncompetitive and there is still little incentive for business to invest and grow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose we should not be surprised by the former statistic as the 1992 World Competitiveness Report prepared in Switzerland rated us just sixteenth out of 22 OECD countries on a scale of competitiveness. Australia did not have to have a recession. There were other policies open. But within the constraints of Labor Party politics, an arrogant and incompetent Paul Keating drove up interest rates to impossible levels. This `scorched earth' economics of the man the Labor Caucus subsequently rewarded drove thousands of small businesses to the wall, with horrific unemployment consequences. But now, rather than tackle the fundamental weaknesses, he attaches this bandaid of make-work schemes in a short term effort to improve the figures&mdash;schemes which have been found deficient on so many previous occasions. It is another example of Paul Keating's incredible arrogance,  because to do otherwise would have required him to admit error. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This credibility gap is vitally important. If the community cannot believe the Prime Minister, it logically follows that they will not have confidence in his policies. Only a few months ago this Prime Minister, in his One Nation statement, estimated a Budget deficit of $6.8 billion. It ended at $9.3 billion and now we are expected to find an extra $13.4 billion to put on the tab. In fact, it is at least $16.1 billion. The Government will sell a few assets and transfer some Reserve Bank profits in an effort to fund just a small proportion of this annual deficit. I think the sale of Qantas will reduce its Budget deficit for this year by about 8 per cent, and Qantas will be gone forever. Some commentators argue that without the Prime Minister's creative accounting, the real anticipated deficit is nearer or just over $20 billion. This is why the people cannot trust Paul Keating; it is why they do not believe him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only a few months ago, again in One Nation, Mr Keating predicted growth figures for this year of 4.75 per cent. Now he estimates growth at 3 per cent. He let Australians believe that highly optimistic forecast&mdash;I think today Senator Button referred to it as a `scenario' rather than a `forecast'&mdash;which he claimed would magically produce jobs, surpluses and tax cuts. He let us believe that it had some independent bureaucratic sanction. Now, of course, we know that it came out of the Minister's office. Cruel, false expectations created for base political motives&mdash;that is the style of Paul Keating, and Australians are unimpressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only this week we read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> that in the preparation of the 1989 Budget the Prime Minister's staff directed the joint economic forecasting group to reduce the current account deficit forecast from the Treasury's estimate of $21 billion to $18.5 billion. The figure turned out to be $22 billion. What was Mr Keating's response this week to such an allegation of political manipulation? The typical Keating response: he attacked the journalist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I say that the whole Budget has to be looked at in the context of the background of this man, promoted by his mates&mdash;a man who has never been endorsed by the Australian people as the expected Prime Minister. This lack of credibility makes understandable such a grossly irresponsible Budget that does nothing to rebuild Australia's competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a secret tax Budget. Apart from the increases in the Medicare levy, tobacco excise and fringe benefits tax, there is a raft of other increases, many of which have not yet been concentrated upon. Budget Paper No. 1 notes that the Government has made tax increases in 22 other different areas. What plans for tax increases does this Government have after the election? We have already had a hint of new taxes not detailed in the Budget further down the track. We are told:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the fiscal position is not stronger than is now projected, the Government will consider and implement a number of tax changes to maintain revenue structure.</PARA>
<PARA>What does that mean? It means further tax hikes and most likely the introduction of a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister must know how imperative it is to reduce taxes on production, because all other industrialised nations have already had to make the shift from taxes on production to taxes on consumption. He must know that, without Australia reforming its tax system likewise, our businesses&mdash;those who employ&mdash;suffer a competitive disadvantage. He argued for such a restructuring of the tax system in 1985. But rather than tell the truth, which would be for him to abandon his opportunity to engender fear in the forthcoming campaign, he says that the new taxes will be on business. Surely not even Paul Keating would be so crazy in Australia's current dire economic predicament as to increase tax on those who employ and provide long term sustainable jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing is surer than that Australia, in these days when the world economies are so interdependent, will have to reform its taxation system to be competitive. This will mean a tax on consumption as taxes on income are reduced. The difference is that on one side the coalition is being honest and on the other side&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;Paul Keating is not telling the truth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not the first time. In this Budget the Government has provided for a range of temporary make-work schemes and training programs costing $3.5 billion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, you will note from the document that the make-work schemes end in two years time. Job creation projects should have been focused on increasing the economy's productivity and encouraging business investment through changes in the tax system rather than electorally motivated symbolic gestures. One wonders how many people under these schemes will end up with skills which can be utilised in the work force in the longer term; or will it be a case of employed one day, permanently unemployed the next? There is a place for training schemes, but even then they can only provide assistance to a very small proportion of the unemployed. </PARA>

Similarly, for Jobstart, only about 15 per cent of jobs created were new jobs. Does anyone remember the Government's Priority One: Young Australia, a youth traineeship scheme?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters will remember that advertising and promotion cost half a million dollars. But how many jobs did it produce? How many traineeships were created out of the scheme? The Government boasted in 1985 that 75,000 traineeships would be created. Did it reach its target? Where are these people now? Are they some of the casualties of the current recession?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essential problem is lack of demand from employers. Until such time as this issue is addressed, job creation schemes of the sort announced in the Budget can be only superficial bandaid measures and training schemes will have minimal effect in overcoming Australia's unemployment tragedy. It is this issue of lack of demand from employers which should have been principally addressed in this Budget. The Government should have addressed the burden of still uncompetitive infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Micro-economic reform has stalled under this Government. The waterfront, transport and communication industries are still not efficient. Elsewhere the results are similar. For example, while the power industry has now improved productivity, the massive debt of electricity utilities has caused power prices to remain high. Then there is the issue of the insidious on-costs which have risen significantly during this Government's period of office. The accord may have delivered some wage restraint at the expense of productivity, but businesses have been lumbered with the superannuation levies, training levies, fringe benefits tax, workers compensation changes, payroll tax and a raft of other imposts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Business Council of Australia survey of May 1992 noted that on-costs add 40 per cent to the wage bill. Is it any wonder that business is struggling and investment spluttering? Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that between 1989-90 and 1990-91 superannuation costs increased by 18 per cent, fringe benefits costs by 17.3 per cent and payroll tax by 11.5 per cent. The Government's disastrous increase in the superannuation levy will only add further to business costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the taxation system. Not only is Labor's taxation system biased against business, as I have outlined, but the total tax take is uncompetitively high and is further increased by this Budget. The reason it is uncompetitively high is that Paul Keating refuses to cut government expenditure because it might cost short term votes. Sadly, under the Keating economic regime, it is easier for businesses to retrench and relocate than it is to invest and remain in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time that the Government encouraged business instead of putting road blocks in its path. Until such time that policies are introduced which lift the burden from our producers and exporters, the misery of high unemployment levels will continue; yet instead of opting for courageous economic measures the Government has opted for easy ones, for the status quo over reform, and for its own self-interest over the public interest. Therein lies the stark contrast between Labor and the coalition's Fightback program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor has put down five economic strategies in the last 18 months as it has fumbled in its search for survival. By contrast, our strategy is clear. It is designed to boost economic growth by building a more competitive and productive economy and a more attractive climate for investment. We have committed ourselves to creating two million new jobs by the end of the decade by reducing business costs and other impediments to growth such as the inflexible labour market. Our strategy of widening the taxation base by introducing a goods and services tax and reducing government spending will create a more productive environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already said that we will cut taxes on business by $20 billion. Payroll tax&mdash;an insidious tax on employment&mdash;will be abolished. That measure alone will create 200,000 new jobs. Similarly, abolishing the training guarantee levy and freezing the level of compulsory employer contributions to employee superannuation will save a minimum of 50,000 to 100,000 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will speed up the pace of micro-economic reform of national transport, shipping, telecommunications, aviation and utilities infrastructure which currently impose cost disadvantages of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent on Australian producers. Our anti-inflationary strategy and reductions in the size and cost of government will significantly lower real interest rates and produce competitive exchange rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our industrial relations policy will provide wide-ranging labour market reforms to encourage voluntary employment agreements and to allow workers and employers to negotiate at the workplace so that wages are based on productivity. We have also committed ourselves to a youth training wage which would create over 100,000 new job opportunities. Additionally, Austrade will provide the long term unemployed with a chance to re-enter the full time work force and gain valuable on the job training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the contrast that the country has before it. Labor: unfunded programs, spending that does not improve competitiveness, short term, make-work schemes and hints of new and expanded taxes.

Add to that a Prime Minister, Paul Keating, who more than any one person is responsible for Australia's unemployment tragedy, who has lost credibility and who does not deserve to be trusted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. I thank Senator McMullan for those remarks. I would hope that Senator Kemp observes the niceties of this chamber. As I said, this Budget reminds one of guilty parents who buy presents for their children, the children they have abused, but who book those presents up on a credit card that they have little hope of ever paying off. They do it in part because they have a commitment to their children, but they do it also because the social worker's review is almost due and they do not want their children taken away from them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not doubt Labor's historical concern for the people of Australia, especially for the poor and disadvantaged. Indeed, it was Labor which instituted most of the great social reforms of the nine decades since Federation. Curtin, Chifley and Jack Lang were stars in the firmament of Australia's reform history. Universal suffrage, social security, sickness and hospital benefits and free education are rights and privileges that we owe to Labor. But now Labor is tired and run down, like the metaphorical parents of whom I spoke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor has deserted its roots and its support. Instead,  since 1983 it has embraced trendy economic ideas which now have turned sour. Labor has abused its children. For those Australians to whom its brand of moderate socialism once brought hope and opportunity, Labor has now led to the dole queues, to bankruptcy courts and foreign takeovers. Australians are bewildered, disillusioned, alienated and angry. The land of opportunity has eluded them, the welfare state has withdrawn, and now the god of economic rationalism has failed. We find in this Budget little acknowledgment by Labor that its god has forsaken it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level playing field is still the Labor icon of the 1990s, along with deregulation and privatisation. So is reliance, though cautious and sober, on the econometric forecasting which has let Labor down in the past and which is still, as David Clark said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . pretending to know what would have happened if what does happen hadn't.</PARA>
<PARA>Although the big picture has not changed greatly, there are token attempts in this Budget to clean up the mess that economic rationalism has left behind. There is, after all, a judgment day just ahead. Labor is once again courting the Australian people&mdash;not with the reforms which once won the allegiance of the workers, but with token handouts designed, probably in vain, to pacify people into voting Labor once again at the next election. There are not as many of them as we expected and some of them, in any case, we strongly support, although we would like to have seen them two years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of health, the Australian Democrats welcome the Budget's reaffirmation of the Government's commitment to a publicly funded health care system, a commitment which we have consistently shared. We too</PARA>
<PARA>have consistently called for an increase in the Medicare levy to strengthen the public health care system. Just the same, we are disappointed that the Budget once again fails to initiate structural reform of Medicare which could remedy its problems. It is therefore difficult to see the Budget's health measures as much more than a belated and somewhat ad-hoc effort to reduce hospital waiting lists immediately prior to the Federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In social security, we obviously welcome pension increases, however illusory, although young unemployed people have once again missed out. The Government has finally extended eligibility for pensioner concessions to all part pensioners&mdash;a measure we have been advocating for some time&mdash;but we would extend it further to all retirees over 60 with an income of less than $15,000 per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am happy to say that our repeated calls for welfare rights centres have finally penetrated the Government's somewhat deaf ear. In fact, several of the social security measures have been the subject of Democrat amendments or Democrat urging over the past two years. We could have saved a lot of heartache and hardship had Labor's guilty conscience regarding its traditional constituents surfaced much earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In agriculture, the farm sector is one of the most neglected of Labor's children. Even now, guilt-tripping has led only to modest gift-giving. We are pleased to see an increase in funding to the rural adjustment scheme, even though it drops dramatically in a year. We note the $800,000 for rural counselling services and the $1.8m to rural community services. But will honourable senators now consider these amounts paltry in view of the crisis in the rural community and the need for substantial social and emotional support? In this area we are also appalled to find no mention of tariffs. Labor's insistence on their reduction has reduced the farmers to beggars. We, on the other hand, want them frozen until a formal inquiry can decide on the protection of our primary producers from cheap imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In manufacturing, we are relieved that the Government is assisting the beleaguered textile, clothing and footwear industry, the pharmaceutical industry and the food industry. But we are disappointed at other spending cuts in manufacturing. In research, increased funding, however minimal to scientific research, development and commercialisation is always good news, although the Budget substantially has recycled the One Nation statement in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We note, however, that the Government has reversed One Nation's proposed cuts in tax concessions to private sector R&amp;D, and its retention of support for rural R&amp;D. The Government has repeatedly identified the biggest failure in the `clever country' not in our scientific enterprise but in the commercialisation of the appropriate fruits of that research. In the absence of enough large indigenous companies in Australia, there is a role for direct government investment in this commercialisation. This Government is neither clever nor wise in its failure to see this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After years of neglect of rail transport, Labor has finally carried out the promises made in One Nation to boost rail funding. This, we have demanded for years. But there is not enough, and it is perhaps far too late. Rural branch lines are threatened with closure&mdash;many have already closed&mdash;and massive job losses are likely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As income tax rebates in remote area zones are increased they are another guilty concession to a much abused sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tobacco excise has increased, as we have advocated for years, but again it indicates a tardiness on the part of Labor as it timidly waited until the non-smoker component of the electorate increased beyond the size of the smoker component so that that concession was electorally acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the environment, it is clear that this Government does not understand ecologically sustainable development and that it certainly has no commitment to it. Having spent a considerable amount of money and taken a great deal of the time of industries and the conservation movements, the Government has now shown up the whole ESD process as an expensive vote-buying smokescreen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent days we have seen a two-day meeting organised by the Government break up at the end of the first day when it became clear to both environmental and industry groups that they were wasting their time and that the Government had no intention of implementing the good and practical recommendations that had come from the ESD committees. Similarly, we have seen the Federal Government quietly drop its commitment to the 20 per cent Toronto greenhouse target, even though there is abundant evidence that this could be achieved without detracting from Australia's economic performance. Indeed, many commentators say that there could be considerable economic advantages in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is solid evidence like this on the record that convinces me that the present Budget allocations to ESD and greenhouse are merely further window-dressing and will not result in any real moves on either front. ESD funding is commendable in any case, but only when it is spent in an environmentally responsible manner. That seems unlikely, for instance, if national forest policy&mdash;a recipient&mdash;allows continued logging in old growth forests and in wilderness areas and no protection of native forests. The national forest funding is, moreover, pitiful. I heard just yesterday that the Wilderness Society and forest conservation groups&mdash;voluntary bodies&mdash;will spend more on forest protection in the next four years than will the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We welcome increased spending on energy conservation and renewable energy, but the plain fact is that the amounts are trivial in relation to the size of the problem. For some years now the Democrats have proposed a modest levy on fossil fuels, with exports exempted, to raise $750m for the development of a sustainable energy industry and the upgrading of urban public transport. This is the sort of money that is needed. It is the sort of money which is not allocated in this Budget. We welcome the planned injection of $25m to establish a national energy grid, but deplore the fact that there is no indication that the planning of generation options will conform at all to the principles of ecologically sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to education, the open learning scheme is a step in the right direction, but the claim that all Australians will be able to benefit from tertiary study if they have access to a television set and a letterbox is farcical unless the open learning program is free of charge. We reject a user-pays element in education, whether it applies to Austudy, voluntary student loans or English as a second language programs. We congratulate the Government, however, on its increase in post-graduate awards, which it clearly adopted after reading our <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Getting to Work</EMPHASIS> document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to women, we are pleased to see increased funding for the Affirmative Action Agency and continuing expenditure on child-care, although it clearly needs to be increased further. We are not so pleased to find no incentives for private and public enterprises to establish work-based child-care programs. Where are the measures to make child-care, parental leave, job-sharing and sick leave adjustments for the care of a sick child, part of the minimum standard for any workplace bargain agreement?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On consideration, we believe that some of the Governments gifts are a little shop worn. Some recipients do not score much at all, even in an area such as trade where there is much more to be done.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where are the tariffs? Where are assertive bilateral trading policies? Where are the streamlined anti-dumping procedures that are so vital for the protection of Australian producers? Where are the simple, inexpensive remedies, such as the mandatory `Buy Australian' labelling scheme we have been promoting?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We commend the Treasurer for the offers he has made, but they are certainly too little. We hope they are not too late. It is precisely this tardiness of timing that is suspect. Pension increases scheduled for March are being brought forward to January; the remote area income tax rebates go into effect in January; a tax on car parking fringe benefits, which we applaud, is postponed until April; and the increased Medicare levy is postponed until next July. So there are no prizes for guessing the election date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these recessionary times, however, the aim of the Budget, the primary objective of any government, must be to provide jobs for the one million Australians whom Labor's policies have deprived of the right to work. This is where the erring parents have finally tried to make amends, although whether it is too late is difficult to say. In any case, Labor has at last distanced itself from its economic rationalist mentors enough to initiate a broad program of public spending which it claims will create tens of thousands of jobs in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program is linked, as we have suggested for years, to local government bodies. Obviously, we support this link, although we also encourage all public and private bodies to apply for job creation funding when they have appropriate projects in hand. The Budget's new jobs will cost Australia $742m in the first year. We consider this money well spent. But the Australian Democrats recently released a plan to provide, conservatively speaking, 150,000 new jobs. This would have cost a total of $2.5 billion which we would raise by means of a jobs levy of 1 1/4 per cent on the employed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We commend the Government's jobs initiative, therefore, but feel it does not go far enough. It is not reducing the unemployment rate by much at all, and this is admitted by the Government. I can well imagine the feelings of unemployed Australians with families they cannot support, mortgages they cannot pay and fading memories of the lifestyles they are unlikely ever to enjoy again, when they hear that unemployment will be more or less constant over the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor is to be congratulated on its honesty, but certainly not to be congratulated on its policies. A 10 per cent unemployment rate is simply unacceptable. The fact that the Government cannot bring it down means that Australia's economy is in a disastrous state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us examine the economic fundamentals. The Budget projects a fall in business investment of 2 per cent. Investment is going into housing instead of into productive plant and machinery. Under the present deregulated banking system, this could lead simply to another property boom and another boom-bust cycle. The desperately low level of household savings will slide even further. Import penetration is rising in many sectors. Growth is estimated at only 3 per cent, but our current account deficit will increase by 25 per cent and our foreign debt will continue to grow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I wish to be clear. I do not criticise the Budget deficit per se. The tragedy is that the warning signs were not heeded earlier. We do criticise the lack of a sustainable funding base for job creation&mdash;and the emphasis there is on a sustainable funding base for job creation, such as we have provided in our <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Getting to Work</EMPHASIS> economic package. Without such a base, this Budget can deal only&mdash;and this we have seen already&mdash;with short term job creation. It cannot set guidelines for long term policy at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">High levels of unemployment are here to stay, unless we create permanent jobs in both public and private sectors. One-off labour market programs in one Budget will not address the underlying problems. That is why I repeat that we need a jobs levy to fund at least 150,000 jobs a year over five years. We cannot afford to run large deficits forever. In living on tick, as we do, we are selling off the farm. What do we do when our creditors foreclose?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the rationalists have lost the battle over job creation programs, unfortunately they have won the war to accelerate the dismantling of the public sector. We object to the acceleration of privatisation. In addition to the airlines, it is indefensible to sell Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Ltd and the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. They are saleable because they are efficient and profitable. Why can the country not continue to reap the benefit? We opposed privatisation of the gas pipeline and the Housing Loan Insurance Corporation the first time the Government proposed it. Our view has not changed. Labor's insistence on this betrayal of its socialist heritage is just another demonstration that economic rationalism, though reeling, is still ruling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government appears unable to free itself of its failed theories, it seems equally powerless to shake off the shackles of a costly Cold War mentality. The defence budget demonstrates graphically that Labor is unable to reorder its priorities to meet the challenges of the 1990s. The 1992 defence policy is essentially the same one put forward five years ago&mdash;a policy inspired by fear of the Soviet Union's naval and air base in Vietnam, and by the suspicion that the USSR and Libya were infiltrating the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in 1992, the real threats to our security are not military threats. It is not an armed attack that Australians fear, but unemployment, national debt, environmental degradation, violence and crime. As our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, has said, Australia's security environment is benign and there is every prospect that it will remain that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not to say that we do not need a defence force; we do. We need a true defence force. We need to monitor and protect our territory and our fishing zone. We need to guard the security of shipping on the high seas, and we need to participate in United Nations peacekeeping operations. But we do not need to build and buy submarines and frigates whose primary role is to defend United States aircraft carriers in a war with the Soviet Union. We do not need F111 bombers which Mr Beazley, our Cold War Minister for Defence, had earmarked for bombing the Soviets out of Cam Ranh Bay. And we certainly do not need to keep throwing money at security threats which do not exist while claiming we cannot fund solutions to the real challenges that face us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It remains an unpalatable fact that this year the Government will spend $1.2 billion on new submarines and frigates. That is almost four times the amount to be spent on our 10-year Landcare program to combat degradation costing us upwards of $1 billion every year. I give another example. The amount allocated to military research this year alone is more than $200m. But the Government is putting little more than one-tenth of that amount into renewable energy and energy conservation measures. Investigation of the greenhouse effect, the most serious challenge to our way of life that we face today, runs a very poor second to our quest for new and better ways of killing and destroying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Getting to Work</EMPHASIS> statement we propose defence cuts of $1.25 billion, eliminating the submarine and frigate programs. Much of this is either capital intensive or involves foreign labour. Some $450m of the savings would be used to help companies and workers convert to civilian production. The rest would go into restructuring industry and funding badly needed public infrastructure programs&mdash;on shore in this country, employing Australians in peaceful work. These savings, plus the revenue from the jobs levy, would therefore net us nearly $4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our colleague Dr Hewson in the other place this week described the Government's proposals as a `Bankcard Budget'. But it is economic rationalism, of which Dr Hewson is an even more ardent advocate, that has created the social and economic chaos that made a Bankcard Budget necessary. Let us make no mistake. Under Dr Hewson's anorexic economics, the pain would be even greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to accept some degree of living on tick for the moment, but we must set up programs and structures that will eventually lead this great country out of recession and into solvency. This Government must stop neglecting its primary responsibility to the citizens of Australia and the environment in which they live. Like the Opposition, it has for too long fanatically embraced the religion of economic rationalism, and it has regularly sacrificed the people of Australia to this cruel god. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time for the Government to rekindle the flame of the light on the hill, snuffed out by the `econocrats' of Treasury and Finance through their willing pupil the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), formerly the Treasurer of Australia. It is the Government's responsibility to look beyond the next few years. It is the Government's responsibility to establish structures and implement programs which will deliver prosperity and sustain it in the long term. It is the Government's responsibility to serve not the ideology of economic rationalism but the people of Australia. We do not believe that this Budget discharges that responsibility. </PARA>

Since the 1991 Budget that spending has increased by 5.9 per cent. With growth in the economy forecast to be between 2.75 and 3 per cent, government spending is taking place at twice the rate of the growth of the economy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's emphasis is all wrong.

Interest rates were kept too high for too long by this Government, crippling our vital rural and small business sectors. We have become used to the Government's rosy growth predictions.

After a hue and cry from the farming and scientific community, the Government has fortunately done an about-turn on its short-sighted approach to save $24m by reducing funding to all rural research and development. The Government should be condemned for threatening the long term future of rural industries and the supporting scientific community by a short-sighted grab for $24m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Party and the Liberal Party commend the Government for reading the Fightback package and introducing a similar 25 per cent increase in remote area zone allowances. This will result in new levels of $338 in basic zone A, $1,173 in special zone A and $57 for zone B. While the $8m funding to encourage doctors in rural areas is welcomed, rural areas and country towns are also suffering from the distress of excessive unemployment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the Government released the new national drought policy and flagged the direction of the new rural adjustment scheme. The last major drought we had was in 1982-83. The breaking of the drought coincided with the election of Mr Hawke as the new Prime Minister. He was able to capitalise on this and form the basis of his Government's growth when agriculture was able to bounce back after the drought. Agriculture grew at the rate of 45 per cent, contributing to growth after that recession of 6 per cent. This was possible because, during the last drought, the National-Liberal Party Government stood by primary industry with policies that retained our breeding stock and other fundamentals so that rural Australia could grow and bloom again after the drought was broken. The Government spent $244m in those days on keeping the national herd and flock for the future, thus protecting Australia's nest egg and enabling the economy to be kick-started once the drought had ended. In today's values that would equate to $415m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, the present Government has provided a total RAS funding of $157m in 1991-92 and promised $166m for this year, which is an increase of $9m for an industry providing 28 per cent of Australia's total exports during a period of depressed commodity prices and when rural Queensland and New South Wales are absolutely drought stricken. In a nutshell, this stark comparison demonstrates this Government's lack of commitment to agriculture compared to the Fraser-Anthony total commitment to rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's scheme of assistance has been poorly targeted and never ahead of the game; it has rarely hit the mark and has been purely reactive. Today's national drought policy is long on rhetoric but short on what counts&mdash;money. In 1989, the Labor Government removed drought from the national disaster arrangement, which meant that the Federal Government ceased funding for drought from that time on. Despite widespread severe drought across most of Australia, which continues in New South Wales today, funding from the Commonwealth has been in a state of uncertainty since then&mdash;until today. Proper and fair access to the rural adjustment scheme and drought funding are vital to maintaining our internationally efficient export earning industries, yet the Budget forecast a further deterioration in our net export position and no improvement this year in our terms of trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A prosperous Australia has always had mining and agriculture going for it in a very strong way. We have developed this expertise over the last 100 years or more and it is recognised worldwide. We have internationally efficient and competitive rural industries, but they are in a mess because of the Government's high interest rate policy and massive international subsidies which are depressing world prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final flaw in the Government's approach in this Budget is that it does not even begin to address increasing our export levels, despite this being the only way that we can begin to reduce our horrendous deficit of $13.4 billion and our forecasted excess of imports over exports of $15 billion. The Government boasts that manufacturing exports have increased at a rate of 10 per cent this year to June last, but research shows that growth has been from a low base. Most of the export growth has been with elaborately transformed manufactures, and 60 per cent of these have received government assistance. Much export growth has been recession driven as many companies are forced to export to maintain factory viability. When the domestic market improves, these exports, sold at under cost, will reduce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our top seven manufacturing exports are either motor vehicles or parts, aircraft parts or other iron and steel products, which have all received, or are receiving, assistance from the Government. This export growth has really been government driven and assisted and paid for. While manufacturing is important and should be supported, that support should never be at the expense of our great primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's One Nation statement in February this year represented a Budget deficit of $9.3 billion and growth rates of 4.75 per cent. In six short months, the Government has managed to lead Australia into 11 per cent unemployment, a deficit of $13.4 billion and a forecasted growth of 2.75 per cent. At this rate of deterioration, how many more months of the Labor Government must Australia endure before an election leads to a change of government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Budget has been totally irresponsible in the way that it has overspent to fund short term jobs. The deficit was to be reduced by 1995 under One Nation. The deficit is now promised to be reduced only as soon as possible. Sadly, this irresponsible Budget will have to be paid for, at great cost, by all Australians. Inflation is expected to rise to 2 per cent; the Medicare levy is to rise to 1.4 per cent; fringe benefits taxes are to be extended; the tobacco excise is to be increased by $5 a kilogram; higher interest rates are predicted. What sort of Budget is this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New taxes are inevitable. In fact, they are even predicted. The Government has foreshadowed increased taxes in 1995-96 if the deficit is not reduced to $5 billion or $6 billion. The Government has once again taken the wrong track. Through this Budget, the Government has deliberately not taken up opportunities to assist Australia to be competitive and to create real jobs and sustainable economic recovery. The vote buying potential of $1.2 billion for job creation schemes has been offered at the cost of neglecting to create real and sustainable jobs through the Government's encouragement of a climate for increased business investment and growth in our export earning industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Budget has ignored the very sector that could brighten Australia's future. In this Budget the Government has ignored the rural sector, the manufacturing sector and the small business sector.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this evening I was responding to a claim in Senator Short's motion that there had been a blow-out in the level of government spending in this Budget. I was referring to the historic record, which shows very clearly that that claim cannot be substantiated. In fact, the level of government spending this financial year in relation to our gross domestic product is 27.0 per cent. That is shown very clearly in table 3 on page 5.6 of Budget Paper No. 1. In 1982-83, the last year in which the Liberals were in power federally in this country, government spending was 28.8 per cent of gross domestic product. That is a much higher figure. Hardly can it be said, then, that government spending has blown out in this Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note the very sloppy drafting of the motion moved by Senator Short. At point (b) he refers to what he says are&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those people opposite sit there time and time again and throw at us policy questions and so forth. As soon as we get up to reply, they become very sensitive; they cannot stand the heat and they ought to get out of the kitchen. I refer&mdash;and I am going to really dish it out&mdash;to point (b) in Senator Short's motion where he refers to what he says are new taxes. Then he goes on to talk about bracket creep, which is also known as fiscal drag&mdash;the phenomenon of wage and salary earners being propelled into higher income tax brackets through the effect of inflation on prices and wages. Bracket creep is hardly a new tax. It is simply an aspect of an existing tax that is the phenomenon of people moving into higher personal income tax brackets as a result of inflationary pressures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I well remember the last Liberal Government which went to the people saying that it would act on bracket creep, it would act on fiscal drag. Mr Fraser went to the people and said that he would end taxation by stealth. That Government pledged itself to adjust all the income tax brackets for inflation. It actually pledged itself to every year increase the tax threshold for each bracket by the inflationary factor for that year. I think that lasted for about 1 1/2 years. After this very strong promise by the Fraser Government, the Liberal Treasurer at the time&mdash;I think it was Sir Phillip Lynch&mdash;then ditched it. He halved the factor; therefore saying that it was not important to adjust the tax brackets for inflation. Finally, we saw Mr Howard, the present spokesperson for industrial relations in the conservative Party, actually ditching the inflation adjustment completely&mdash;I think in the 1978 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let us not have Liberals coming into the Senate in 1992 lecturing to this Government about bracket creep and fiscal drag. The record shows them to be extremely wanting on this subject. The Liberals went to elections promising to adjust the tax scales for this phenomenon and they could not handle it. They got rid of the whole adjustment within about three or four financial years. They did it for a very clear reason. They did it for the reason that they believed there were more votes in it for them if they made discretionary income tax cuts every now and then. Instead of having tax cuts by adjustment of brackets every year, they thought there was more mileage in it for them to adjust the brackets just before an election and have very clear discretionary personal income tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing I find totally nonsensical about this is that people in the conservative party are still going on about bracket creep when we have inflation in this country down to the rate of 2 per cent. Hardly anybody is getting pushed into higher personal income tax brackets in a situation where we have single digit inflation of almost the lowest possible magnitude. I can understand interest in adjusting income tax brackets for inflation when we had inflation running at 11 1/2 per cent, as it was under the Liberals when they were last in power. I can understand the imperative of talking about adjusting tax brackets in those situations for inflation. But the reality is, as I pointed out earlier, that inflation in this country is now in single digits. It is very low at 2 per cent per annum. One can hardly say that bracket creep is a major problem facing the Australian community when we have the inflation rate at such a low level and therefore very few people moving between tax brackets for illusory reasons&mdash;reasons of inflation rather than because their real incomes have increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short claims in point (d) of his motion that the Federal Government is discarding the Budget's return to a surplus position in 1995-96. Point (d) of his motion is totally hypocritical when one looks at the record. The claim in point (d) is a classic case of the pot calling the kettle black. Again, all we need to do to check these claims made by conservative politicians is look at the data appendices to the Budget. In Budget Paper No. 1 at page 5.6, table 3, we can find some delicious data going back into history which shows just how poor has been the performance of Liberal governments in this country on the question of Budget surpluses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short was lecturing us earlier tonight about not having a Budget surplus in this country. He was saying that this Government had discarded the effort to have a Budget surplus in 1995-96. As a front bench member of the conservative coalition in this Parliament, he was lecturing the Labor Government about not having a Budget surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the record. Let us look at the data on page 5.6 of Budget Paper No. 1. There on the record we can see the outcome of all Commonwealth Budgets going back to 1953-54. There is data for 39 financial years. We can ask the question: how many Budget surpluses appear in that table, which goes back to 1953-54, the golden era of Menzies? Out of 39 years there were four years in which the Commonwealth Budget was in surplus. How many of those four years were years when the Liberals were in government?  None! Not one of those four years in which there was a Budget surplus saw a Liberal Government in power at the Federal level in Australia. In not one year were the Liberals able to bring in a Budget surplus. Yet they came in here earlier tonight lecturing the Labor Party about not having a Budget surplus three years into the future&mdash;in 1995-96. In the period after 1953-54, those people opposite could never deliver a positive balance, a positive outcome in the Federal Government in Australia. In that 39-year period there were 27 years of Liberal Government and in not one of those years was there a Federal Budget surplus. Meanwhile, Labor delivered four consecutive years of Budget surplus in this Government in the 1980s. So let us not have any more lecturing by honourable senators opposite, by conservative members of the Federal Parliament, about Budget surpluses, about Labor not having a Budget surplus three years into the future, in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short also made the rather extravagant claim that this was a spend now, pay later `Bankcard' Budget&mdash;another case of the pot calling the kettle black. I have just pointed out that in a period of 27 years of Liberal Government there was not one Budget surplus at the Federal level in Australia. In every financial year of those 27 years, the Liberal Treasurer of the day spent more than was received in revenue by that Government. There was no Bankcard then; I do not think Bankcard existed in the golden age of Menzies. There was what we used to call hire-purchase. Australia paid very dearly for those years of Liberal governments. Basically, we paid on the drip-feed basis, not on the Bankcard basis. We paid on the hire-purchase system. As a result, public debt mounted up at the Federal level as the Liberal Party in government for 27 years in two periods delivered Budget deficit after Budget deficit after Budget deficit. Opposition senators came in here today and lectured us on not having a Budget surplus in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to look at Senator Short's claim in his motion that we are going to introduce a raft of new taxes. Let us look at the history of taxation at the Federal level in this country. It is very revealing. In Budget Paper No. 1, for example, on page 4.59, for those Liberals who are present who wish to check it, Federal Budget taxation revenue as a percentage of Australia's gross domestic product, as a broad percentage of our national income, is expected to be 22.2 per cent this financial year. In the last year of the Liberal Government in this country, in 1982-83, the percentage of tax to our gross domestic product was not 22.2 per cent and it was not 23.2 per cent; it was in fact 24 per cent. So, while we have Senator Short lecturing us about so-called new taxes, the record shows that the percentage of our gross domestic product accounted for by taxation now is 1.8 percentage points lower than at the time the last Liberal Government was in office at the Federal level in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see from those very clear figures that the share of our gross domestic product taken by government revenue is well below the share taken under the last Liberal Government. In fact, if we look at the concept the other way around, we can say that a great deal more revenue would have to be collected simply to reach that level obtained by the Liberals in 1982-83. In other words, conceptually, there is much room for extra revenue to be collected at the Federal level before this Government would see the proportion of gross domestic product taken by taxation rise to the level achieved by the Liberals in government in the early 1980s. Of course, we do not intend to take taxation up to that 24 per cent share of gross domestic product that the last Liberal Government had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are some of the points that needed to be answered tonight. I think it is very clear that we have some very hypocritical points being made in this debate by members of the conservative parties who claim that somehow Australia is letting down the side by bringing in the Budget that it did on Tuesday night. Certainly, the objective facts show very clearly that this particular Budget is well in line with the historical trends in this country. It is a Budget where government spending has not blown out, as claimed by Senator Short; where government spending as a proportion of gross domestic product is lower now than it was at the time the last Liberal Government was in power; and certainly where government taxation revenue as a proportion of gross domestic product is lower than it was when the last Liberal Government was in power at the Federal level. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This, of course, is an election Budget. It is certainly not an economic Budget, a rational Budget or any other kind of Budget. It is simply an election Budget. My views about that were reinforced yesterday morning when I shared a breakfast seminar for a Sydney accounting firm, Duesburys, with a former Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, John Phillips.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paraphrasing his interesting address, he clearly indicated that the Budget was a political document that has only short term objectives and that it certainly did not look beyond the next election, although I must say that he did indicate that he thought the assumptions underlying it were much more credible than, say, those in One Nation. Many of the comments made in Budget Statement No. 2 were quite gloomy and, to that extent, quite reasonable. He did, of course, raise other matters such as the problems involving the Reserve Bank perhaps getting itself locked into set interest rate positions. But, in general, he confirmed the view I had that this Budget is a very short term Budget and is a very politically oriented, next election Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is a next election Budget, what are the messages in it about when the next election will be? There is no doubt that if the basic messages of gloom are there, and are to be taken seriously, there is something to be said for Mr Keating perhaps taking the risk of having an election immediately. There is nothing in this Budget which shows that by next May there will be any basic improvement in the situation. Not even the multi-millions of dollars being spent buying short term jobs will resolve the problem. So we have to decide whether Mr Dawkins is the Artful Dodger, as Paddy McGuinness said, or whether Mr Keating is Mr Micawber. Mr Micawber-Keating is waiting in hope that something will turn up by next May to help his election prospects. Apparently, according to Paddy McGuinness, the Artful Dodger has come up with a lot of politically expedient stuff in the Budget which, of course, does nothing for this economy and really does nothing to create any lasting jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at these two Dickens characters, I suppose we have every right to say, `What in the dickens is really happening?'. I fear that looking at this Budget for any kind of indication of a real sense of recovery or real prospects of improvement is not a very fruitful exercise. It was dramatic tonight to see the difference between the manner in which the Budget was brought down earlier this week by Mr Dawkins with its feeling of gloom, disaster and no real sense of any kind of progress towards resolving Australia's major problems, and the response by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) which gave a feeling of real excitement, direction, enthusiasm and hope for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is there in this Budget to make this Government's election prospects look any better? A bit of fiddling the books, I suppose; a bit of buying a few jobs; but, really, there is nothing there that does anything to improve the economy. The assessment of the accountants, Duesburys, in its Budget reaction paper was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Budget does nothing for the private sector either by way of taxation concessions or rate reductions or by providing meaningful incentives such as for exporters. A great deal could have been done to provide stimulus to the private sector by such measures thereby enabling real incentive, real growth and real jobs that would last beyond the term of the next Government. In summary, the Budget was as we expected but ignores the need to stimulate real economic recovery.</PARA>
<PARA>KPMG Peat Marwick, another major accounting firm, in its Budget analysis said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has failed to provide any significant stimulus to business investment and it can be expected that there will be no significant growth in employment in the private sector.

Of course, Mr Hawke has pointed to those false expectations which have destroyed whatever credibility was left in the man who created this recession&mdash;the man who, in fact, engineered this recession&mdash;Mr Keating, who has proudly said that he engineered it. It is interesting that the Budget Papers state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Experience in Australia and Europe during the 1980s suggests that it will take considerable time to reduce unemployment to more acceptable levels.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a whole range of reasons why it is going to take considerable time to reduce unemployment to acceptable levels. One of the main reasons is that there is such a massive level of hidden unemployed and underemployed that if there is any indication of economic upturn, there will be more of these people, if you like, coming out of the woodwork, and being available for work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just an assertion that these people are there. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has done a survey on both hidden unemployment and underemployment. The latest hidden unemployment figure shows something like 800,000 Australians prepared to work within four weeks&mdash;wanting to work, but not even listing themselves as available for work under the Australian Bureau of Statistics normal unemployment figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is for a variety of reasons, but mostly because there was no point in putting their names down because they did not think there were any jobs, or because they had accepted other situations such as Austudy to get themselves out of dole queues. There are 800,000 people who would rather have a job. The recent survey done by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on underemployment showed that there was something like 600,000 people working part time who wanted to work longer hours and, in particular, wanted to work full time. So here we have something like 2 1/4 million Australians either unemployed officially; in the hidden unemployed, as revealed by the statistician; or in the underemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why we will have a massive overhang of unemployment that this Government will not be able to get rid of, firstly, because it does not have the capacity to do so, and secondly, because it does not have the money to throw at these schemes. All that the Government has done with its massive unemployment programs, using money that it does not have in the present Budget, is prevent unemployment from rising even further. That is all it is doing. It is not cutting unemployment; it is not getting jobs for the people who are unemployed now; it is simply stopping that number getting worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is evident from the figures in this Budget. The number of unemployed in the 1992-93 year is listed as being 10.5 per cent, as against the average of 10.4 per cent last financial year. This year, unemployment will be a fraction higher than it was last year. The only reason it is not an awful lot higher than that, is that the Government is throwing money into these unemployment schemes which simply provide temporary jobs at the expense of taxpayers or borrowers. Even the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Illawarra Mercury</EMPHASIS>, which has certainly never been renowned for supporting us, has come out with a front page article today saying that workers in Wollongong, a Labor stronghold, will not be conned by this kind of nonsense and that, in fact, all that is happening is that the Government is creating temporary jobs to get it past the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reserve Bank Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, which I dealt with earlier today, demonstrates that things are a lot worse in this recession than they were in 1982-83. Unemployment is much deeper and more sustained in the current recession; and when the drought factor is removed from the 1982-83 recession, this is a far worse recession. As the Budget Papers say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unlike the recovery from the 1982-83 recession, the pick-up in demand is likely to be much slower and hence the turnaround in investment will be delayed and weaker when it occurs.</PARA>
<PARA>I underline `when it occurs'. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may also be influenced by the extent to which improved management and work practices allow better use of existing plant and equipment.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, greater production may be achieved without increasing employment levels, by better use of existing plant and equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also says, and I repeat what I said earlier, that it will be the public sector&mdash;the Government&mdash;that will continue to support activity in 1992-93 with a pick-up of spending through the year.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Australians, the bulk of whom are employed by the private sector, see no hope of major investment or major job increases in the private sector, we see it will be the Government that will be providing the stimulus and support to activity in 1992-93 with a pick-up of spending through the year. It even says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Net exports&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>on which our future depends&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">are expected to detract from GDP growth. Imports are projected to rise more quickly than demand as domestic expenditure recovers. Subdued growth in the world economy, particularly the slowdown in Japan, and smaller increments to capacity in the non-rural sector are expected to constrain export growth.</PARA>
<PARA>So what is happening with one of the key indicators? One of the key things that dominate our economy is the current account balance and it is going to worsen to about $15 billion or 3 3/4 per cent of GDP. I said that Statement No. 2 indicates the real severity of the problem. It certainly indicates that the longer this Government waits before it has its election, the worse off, basically, Australia will be. Page 2.74 of the Budget Papers states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During 1992-93, employment growth will be supported by declining real unit labour costs. This will reflect continued restrained wages growth and a forecast increase in productivity.</PARA>
<PARA>But the problem here is that unless we get greater investment in plant and equipment&mdash;and remember, it is going to be minus 2&mdash;we are not going to get nearly enough increased productivity to lift Australia out of the mire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter of some concern in the Budget Papers is a hint of higher interest rates. The Budget Papers state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A significantly lower exchange rate than assumed would lead to upward pressures on inflation.</PARA>
<PARA>We are being told that the key will be fighting inflation. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the still moderate levels of expected domestic demand could dampen the flow-through of higher import prices to inflation.</PARA>
<PARA>If the policy objective is to make certain that we do not get a much lower exchange rate, I wonder what the risks are of higher interest rates in order to keep the Aussie dollar up? We have already seen massive Reserve Bank buying of the Aussie dollar to hold it up. It seems that if this Government is committed to its stated policy objectives and to the forecasts that are in this document, it may well be that even higher real interest rates&mdash;and we should remember that interest rates are already very high in real terms in Australia, as the Reserve Bank annual report tabled today pointed out&mdash;will be needed to protect the Australian dollar in the dismal situation that we are now facing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we are now facing another dismal situation, and that is the admission by the Treasurer that in order to finance the tax cuts that he is determined to have, he is going to have to increase taxes. We have already seen some increased taxes in this Budget. For example, another $120m or so is to be raised by taxing the fringe benefit derived by people parking in city parking stations. This is probably the only bit of investment stimulus that the Government is providing. It is giving an exciting new opportunity to business by, in effect, penalising people for parking in the city. It may well be creating an opportunity for businesses to build parking stations near suburban railway stations. This will mean that they will not be subject to this tax. I cannot see any other stimulus to business in this Budget. This indirect stimulus may be the only one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to establish what taxes will be raised to pay for Mr Dawkins's tax cuts. We have heard in debates on the Fightback package that Mr Keating was a great fan of the GST. Honourable senators will remember that back in 1985 he got rolled by the former Prime Minister. Mr Keating, a former fan of this kind of tax, has repeatedly said in recent times that he attacks the tax because there is no longer any need for it; that there was a need in 1985 but there is not now because he has broadened the tax base. That is the line&mdash;the totally disreputable and nonsensical line&mdash;that Paul Keating, the Prime Minister, has spread around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that Mr Keating has increased the tax base. He imposed a tax on ice cream, flavoured milk, muesli bars and on orange and other fruit juices. Of course, they do not count as food in the opinion of a man who says that he would never introduce a consumption tax on food. This line is echoed, of course, by the clones on the Government front bench in the Senate. So he did broaden the tax base to a  degree&mdash;he  introduced  a</PARA>
<PARA>consumption tax on kids' food. But this has not in fact broadened the tax base at all. It has hit some individual items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the facts. In 1985, when Mr Keating was claiming that there was a need for a GST, the share of total taxation revenue made up of income tax was 40.4 per cent. It is now up to 42.9 per cent. So he certainly has failed to broaden the tax base. He has imposed a greater tax burden on PAYE taxpayers since then. The burden of tax on ordinary working Australians who pay PAYE tax has gone up from 40.2 to 42.9 per cent since the time Mr Keating wanted to have more indirect taxes. Something like 60.4 per cent of all tax revenues in 1985-86 came from income taxes. The figure is now up to 68.6 per cent. I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the table from the Budget Papers which indicates this share of tax revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other side of this equation is quite interesting. The table shows that all of the other taxes, such as sales tax, which represented 30.4 per cent of taxation revenue in 1985-86 when Mr Keating wanted to increase them, have now fallen to 25.2 per cent of collections. It is clearly evident that the share of tax revenue made up of the sorts of taxes that Mr Keating wanted in 1985 has fallen dramatically under this Government. If these are the taxes that Mr Keating liked in 1985, they provide him with enormous scope to introduce greater taxes along those lines now that he is the boss. His then boss stopped him doing it at a time when those taxes totalled only 30.4 per cent of total taxation revenue. Now, they are only 25 per cent. So it is clear that this is a great area for Mr Keating to jump into.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all, he cannot do much more with income tax which already represents 68.6 per cent of total collections. If he is after some extra taxes, the only place to which he can turn is the other taxes area&mdash;things like petrol tax and sales tax. I might just mention that they are the taxes that we are going to remove. They are the taxes, particularly on business, that we are going to wipe right out. They are the hidden taxes that people do not realise exist. People do not know that they are imposed on orange juice, flavoured milk and even toilet paper, soap and detergent. All of these hidden consumption taxes will be removed and replaced by a fair and equitable goods and services tax which will pay for a reduction in income tax. That is the whole point of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have a situation in which the tax bill of pay as you earn workers, who have to foot the greatest single sector of tax, has gone up since Mr Keating wanted to have a GST back in 1985-86 from 40.2 per cent to 42.9 per cent of the total bill. The ordinary Australian taxpayer is being slugged more and more and has to pay a bigger and bigger proportion of the tax burden of this nation under this Government. Yet the ordinary PAYE worker is supposed to be the person that this Government represents. Clearly it does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the only organisation that is looking after the best interests of the PAYE taxpayer is the coalition, which seeks to reduce that burden of income tax. Instead of having taxes on production and income, the coalition seeks to have taxes on consumption. We need to do this so that we can reduce Australia's costs, so that we can provide incentives for Australian producers and exporters, so that we can compete again, and so that we can create new jobs. There needs to be a fair and rational consumption tax system in Australia instead of the present unfair and totally dishonest tax system which allows this Government to pretend that it does not tax consumption while it raises $10 billion a year in tax through sales tax alone as well as another $7 billion out of the petrol tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at petrol tax alone, taking it off production would remove a massive burden on Australian industry. But this Government is not going to do anything like that. Instead of reducing the price of petrol to business users by 26c a litre&mdash;and transport costs are one of the major elements of Australian costs, which are so uncompetitive compared with other nations around the world, particularly those nations selling us goods&mdash;we should recognise the benefits that come from reducing petrol tax, and see how we can create an environment in which the private sector can employ more people and how there can be more jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, there is a solution. This Government has refused to follow its advice in the Budget Papers, which state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The solution lies in generating far more employment opportunities as a result of faster and more sustainable economic growth and appropriate wage outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA>Only in Fightback do we have that solution brought into effect. All this Budget is, is a very short term Budget aimed at the next election. If the Government had any brains, it would have an election before this Budget falls apart, which it will certainly be demonstrated to have done before next May, which the pundits say is when the Government will go to the people. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go through some key Budget numbers, since numbers seem to be the order of the day. There is a deficit of less than $14 billion, which the money markets have accommodated and accepted. There is prediction of a 3.3 per cent growth in GDP. It is said by those on the other side that that is not enough, and that it should be 4 per cent or 5 per cent.

What it is picking at is not the reality but its interpretation of what is going on. That is not a proper analysis of this Budget. What should be brought out, if it is to be criticised, is a tight, well argued, well evidenced rebuttal to what is put forth. No rebuttal has taken place here tonight. Instead, the Opposition has gone around creating straw men which it then knocks over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go through the Budget strategy. In this Budget the Government has used a fiscal approach. It has supplemented, as I said before, a sluggish private sector demand and initiated a series of employment related programs in order to remove the burden of unemployment on Australian families. As I understand the criticism from the other side, the Government should not have sought to remove the burden of unemployment on Australian families because the way it did it was not necessarily through the private sector. Since it was not through the private sector, the criticism is that in some way the jobs are tainted and should not be allowed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to deal with other matters that have been raised. The Opposition says that its proposals will increase the size of the private sector, but it will leave the private sector without any protection.

On the other hand, the Government looks at each industry in its own situation and applies the proper approach accordingly. </PARA>

First of all, there has been a decline in our estimated deficits over the last three years. It is worth looking at them and reminding ourselves of them. The Government has estimated that this year we will have a deficit of somewhere between $13 billion and $14 billion. If we take into account asset sales, it is more like $16 billion. If we take into account other aspects and the inconsistency of the forecasting over the last 10 years, we could conclude that it could well be closer to $20 billion. I would certainly be prepared to lay a lazy dollar against the fact that it could well be closer to $20 billion than $14 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at these particular figures, at what has occurred in the last two years and the projections for this year, it was predicted in 1991 that there would be a surplus of $8.1 billion; in fact, it came in at $1.9 billion, which meant that $6.2 billion was overspent by this current Government. For the last year, a negative balance of $4.6 billion or $4.7 billion was predicted; it came in at $9.3 billion. We are now looking at a situation where, according to the Government's figures, we are faced with a negative balance of between $13 billion and $14 billion as well as, as I have outlined, the effects of asset sales and other aspects. So we have seen an enormous turnaround. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do taxes have to increase? Very simply, if the Government is to spend money, it has to raise income to cover that particular cost. It cannot go on forever putting things on the never-never or on the Bankcard. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is now known as the `Bankcard Prime Minister'. That is what this Budget has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cooney mentioned that 3.3 per cent was not enough growth. I also believe that 3.3 per cent is not enough growth, but it is a lot more realistic than the figure of 4.75 per cent that was put before us in the One Nation statement last February. But it is not enough growth to avoid increases in taxation or, alternatively, cuts in government expenditure. They are the two options the Government has to balance its Budget: it either increases its revenue base or decreases its expenditure. At 3.3 per cent the growth will not be sufficient to raise enough taxes to pay for this deficit into the future and the promised tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cooney and others on the other side of the chamber made reference&mdash;I am not sure of the exact words&mdash;to bean counting and the economic bookworms. It is not only the economists and the accountants but also the previous Prime Minister. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today, Mr Hawke is quoted as saying yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now by what has happened you've got the Government in a situation where it's going to have over its head this threat of further taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>The former Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke, the longest serving Prime Minister of the Australian Labor Party in Australia's history, recognises the very simple fact that, if the Government does not balance the Budget or spends too much, it has to increase taxes. That is why the motion before us is accurate in terms of what was put down in both the House of Representatives and the Senate just two days ago. Following on from that, we need to examine where those taxes are likely to come from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cooney also challenged us to make some comments about Fightback. I am quite prepared and quite happy to do that. Fightback is about putting incentive back into people's objectives; it is about giving them the opportunity to look after themselves; it is about allowing them to be independent family units. It recognises very clearly that income tax cuts and tax credits in relation to health cover and other measures primarily go to those on lower incomes. It will give them back their dignity. That is what Fightback is all about. It also addresses the situation we have in our ramshackle, indirect tax system. It removes $20 billion of business input taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Hill said tonight in his reply to the Budget, estimations done by a survey of BCA members in February-March indicate that if payroll tax could be removed another 200,000 jobs would be generated in businesses. That would get rid of 20 per cent of our unemployed people and would put them into full time jobs, not mickey mouse jobs, as is proposed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cooney also challenged us by asking what was wrong with some fiscal stimulus by the Government. There is nothing wrong with fiscal stimulus so long as it is directed in the correct way at the right time and it is fair and equitable. I have already mentioned today just how unfair and inequitable the fiscal stimulus is that the Government has through its grants program&mdash;in particular, the discrimination against country shires and the way the formula has been structured. It ends up, particularly in Western Australia, with those marginal seats held by the Labor Party being the beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the motion&mdash;and that is what we are hear to speak about&mdash;which, as I have already said, has been moved as a result of what occurred two days ago. Why is it necessary to increase taxes? We have options when it comes to what to do in this country. We can sell off the farm, but there comes a time when we run out of things to sell. It is noted that the sales of assets in this particular Budget are to assist in funding this deficit, not to reduce debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If we keep on spending money&mdash;as this nation has been doing, particularly in the last 10 years with the current account, and in the last three years with Budget deficits and the blow-outs I have already mentioned&mdash;eventually the bank manager will tap us on the shoulder and say, `No more; you have to raise some money and start paying it back'. That is why taxes will go up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This nation has failed dismally in this area, particularly in the period of the Hawke-Keating Governments. In that period, our national debt has blown out by some $160-odd billion. Even if today we could stabilise that and pay back half a billion dollars a year&mdash;which would be an enormous performance&mdash;it would take 80 years to pay it off. So at least three or four generations to come have been mortgaged just through inappropriate activities and policies, including those high interest rate policies mentioned tonight that kill off small business, hundreds of farmers and people's jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I only have to look down the street in Victoria Park just east of the business centre in Perth in which my office is situated. Over 40 per cent of businesses along Albany Highway have closed their doors almost entirely because of the high interest rate regime. That regime put those people out of business; they could not afford to carry on. Their dreams were destroyed by the actions of the current Prime Minister, the `Bankcard Prime Minister'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We note that in the Budget Mr Dawkins said the promised tax cuts in the One Nation program would go ahead. If they are to go ahead, there are only two other areas of the community that can be taxed&mdash;and they are business and the consumer. They are the options before the present Government. I believe that the Government cannot tax business any further. If it does, more and more businesses will close down and the problems we have with bankruptcy will be exacerbated&mdash;and of course that flows on through to employment. The bankruptcy figures have virtually doubled each year in the last four years. The figures for the Hawke-Keating years are more than double those of the Fraser years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leaves just one option&mdash;I will not address it now because we have it before us and I will be speaking on it&mdash;and that is the sales tax legislation. There are some very significant changes in that legislation. The Government is really left with only one option to raise taxation, and that is the introduction of a goods and services tax or a consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we want to be internationally competitive, if we want our farmers and miners to get back on top of their problems and compete internationally, if we want industries, about which so many of us talk from time to time in terms of value-added, to become an integral part of the Australian scene, they must be allowed to be internationally competitive. To be internationally competitive, they must have an internationally competitive taxation system. Most countries in the world have recognised that. Other countries that want to be internationally competitive have recognised that they must have an industrial system that is internationally competitive, and that industrial system must give incentive to the people who are involved in the workplace. Both the current taxation system and the industrial system fail on both those counts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at Senator Short's motion and the options before the Government, having regard to the way it has gone about things over recent years with its Bankcard mentality, the Government will have no option if it is to deliver those income tax cuts but to introduce some form of consumption tax. I believe it would be totally appropriate and correct, if the Government were honest about its intentions, for it to show commitment by putting before the Australian public a long term program to address the problems we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody can deny that we do have serious problems with our infrastructure and debt, whether it be on our current account or on our deficit. As Senator Boswell outlined tonight, we have enormous debt problems in the farm sector&mdash;some $105,000 net debt per farm in Australia. In some States, including my own State of Western Australia, it is almost double that. Yet those farmers, those individuals, go on producing an enormous amount year after year. If they are to be allowed to recover from that particular position to become effective employers again, we must take away those existing business taxes. Senator Short's motion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . condemns the Government for its cowardice in not being prepared to tell the Australian people which new or additional taxes they will have to bear.</PARA>
<PARA>I challenge the Government to spell out quite clearly its intentions for the next 12 months: its capital works program and how that has to be started by December this year and end in December 1993. It needs to spell out its program and what it will do over the next three, four, five and six years in a much more succinct and fair manner. It owes that to the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am on that subject, the Government still has the opportunity to correct the injustices it has foisted upon many in the Australian community with this capital works program. As I have said before, I am not saying that there should not be some fiscal stimulus. I am saying that, if there is, it should be applied fair and equitably. This Budget begs the question: why does the City of Wanneroo get $7m&mdash;sorry, the City of Stirling get $7m and the City of Wanneroo, right alongside of it, get nothing?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As promised I am writing to clarify issues you raised in the Senate on 25 June 1992 in relation to claims for payments made by the Australian Builders Labourers Federated Union of Workers, WA Branch (WABLF) to the Department of Industrial Relations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Department has now completed an examination of the relevant files and assures me that all payments relevant to the WABLF have been processed in accordance with normal procedures under the Workplace Reform Program administered by the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The processing of claims for reimbursement of payments to the WABLF and all other organisations involved in the work on the Construction Industry Reform Strategy was made in accordance with normal financial management procedures, involving the examination and verifying of relevant invoices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reimbursement for air travel has been made on the basis of the applicable economy class fare. The WABLF was reimbursed for relevant accommodation costs due to the need for their representatives to stay interstate overnight because of the distances involved in travelling to and from Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Room costs only have been paid on hotel accounts. Where hotel accounts involve cents ($172.50) it is because a Bonus Card corporate discount rate has been applied to the room charge (the normal rate was $230.00).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Department's review of the accounts has shown some accounting errors by my Department. Details are contained in the Schedule of Adjustments annexed to the Expenditure Reconciliation Statement which is attached. There are instances of both overpayment and underpayment. The net result is that the Department owes the WABLF $105.00.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have asked the Secretary of my Department to examine whether these errors have any broader implications for the Department's accounting and audit procedures and to report to me as soon as possible on this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You queried (Hansard Page 4718) the airfare of $2267.00 claimed by the WABLF for travel to the meeting of 3 December 1991. The invoice submitted by the travel agent for the WABLF shows the structure of the airfare as a return airfare Perth to Canberra on Australian Airlines and Ansett on a mixed first and business class basis.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amount has, of course, not been paid. In any event, only a return economy fare would be reimbursed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should clarify the position regarding funds available under relevant Department programs. An initial amount of $19272.00 based on anticipated expenditure (see footnote(1)) was approved by me in February 1991 under the Workplace Reform Program for activities relating to the Industrial Relations Working Party. A further amount of $20000.00 was approved by me in November 1991. Of the initial $19272.00, an amount of $15285.06(2) was spent in 1990/91. The remainder was reallocated before the end of that financial year to other projects under the Workplace Reform Program. Of the further allocation of $20000.00, $6131.00(2) was spent by end-May 1992. This left $13869.00 which was reallocated by end-May to other projects under the Workplace Reform Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect of claims made by the WABLF for reimbursement of expenses for meetings attended on 3 and 17 December 1991, I confirm what I said in the Senate on 25 June 1992. The purpose of these meetings was explained  in  that statement.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year's conference was attended by eighty-two student delegates from 22 schools attended. After meeting in nine panel discussions in which they questioned adults about vital environmental issues, they went on excursions to see energy and regeneration projects and to explore ways to connect with each other and with the environment. They then developed 55 project proposals to implement in their schools on return and for circulation to give others ideas. These projects will be submitted to the Ministry of Education to stimulate ideas throughout WA. Through three mini-parliament sessions the delegates discussed the messages they would send to adult decision-makers. Their 26 recommendations follow.</PARA>

For that reason, I wish to highlight just three of them now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 20 begins:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our government should listen to the voice of Australian citizens&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and goes on to suggest a people's committee to act as a communication channel. My response to this recommendation is twofold. I am pleased that the students have not written us off, for they still believe that the structures by which our society is governed have a place. But&mdash;and this is my second response&mdash;as parliamentarians we should all take this to heart. It is not only government that needs to listen to the people; it is all sides of this chamber and of the other place. The young people who bring this recommendation will soon be of voting age. If at that stage in their lives they believe that the voice of the people of Australia is not heard within these corridors and chambers, our democracy will be in grave danger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 26 calls for conferences involving young adults and adults, particularly adults in power. They are very tactful not to say `older adults'. It is a call for participatory democracy and for turning upside down the present political debate. The recommendation also contains these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also recommend that a young adult represents all of us as adviser in parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>At a time when youth unemployment is taxing minds all over the country, at a time of summits about the issue and at a time of Budget, this call is all the more pertinent. It demonstrates that there is a reservoir of creativity among our young people and that they have the ideas and the will to participate in our society if we have the courage to listen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, I draw attention to recommendation 4, which calls for a reduction of at least 10 per cent in Australia's defence budget, with the money being redirected into environmental projects&mdash;for example, reafforestation. Clearly, these students have recognised that we, the older generation, are stealing from them the planet they love and that we are killing it and the people of the planet. They are asking that we leave it in a habitable condition for them and for their children. It is a request we cannot ignore; nor can we push it away and declare it an idealistic fantasy. We are determining the shape of their future, not ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I began by saying that the conference buoyed up my spirits. I repeat that now as I conclude. These students have looked at a range of issues over which they could have become very downhearted. But they have applied themselves to see that there is hope and work to be done. I pray that we will not stand in their way. </PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it a fact that Commissioner Newnham forwarded directly to you a copy of a Federal Police transcript of a telephone conversation in which a $5,000 bribe was discussed by the former disgraced police Minister, the member for Chatsworth with another person under Federal Police investigation.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it a fact that following this advice from Commissioner Newnham arrangements were made for the $5,000 to be listed as a legal donation to the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wayne Goss: Mr Speaker, the situation that occurred was that there was no illegal donation which was the previous question. No, no he did not raise with me any illegal donation nor did he raise with me any bribe, at any stage. He did however, and I</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Speaker: Interjections . . . Order!</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wayne Goss: No, no, Mr Speaker I am going to have to be very careful about this, I am going to have to be very careful because I have to defend the Government but at the same time I want to avoid the sort of impropriety which we have just seen from the member for Landsborough, by raising a matter which she knows is before the courts.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now, now, Mr Speaker, and what happened was and I haven't had a chance to check this yet, but I will check it and to the best of my recollection, sometime in 1990, I think it was one or two days after the Minister for Police had gone overseas, when the Minister for Police in 1990, had left the State and gone overseas I received a request from the Police Commissioner if he could see me in the Minister's absence and he said it was confidential and he needed to see me personally, I didn't know what it was about.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">When he came to see me I was very disappointed, I have not revealed this before because . . . as we all know, as we all know, the common wisdom and the media run campaign is very much one of suggesting that there has been a smear campaign conducted by the former Police Minister, against the Commissioner over the course of the last year.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But well prior to that in fact back in mid 1990 I was very sorry to say that the Police Commissioner came behind the Minister's back to se me, no, no to hand to me . . . the Minister was overseas and as soon as he went away the Commissioner came to see me to show to me a transcript indicating a certain individual, had discussed in a phone conversation with another individual, not the then Minister at all, the making of a donation to that member's election campaign. A member of the Labor Party for that member's campaign.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I said that on the face of it there was nothing improper about it but it certainly warranted investigation by myself and that I would do it and the Police Commissioner went away well satisfied with the half hours work.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, what happened then was that I determined if a member of parliament, particularly a Minister, particularly a Minister had received such a substantial donation, then there were certain bench marks of propriety that that Minister would have to had measured up to, if he was to remain in my Cabinet . . . You mentioned pecuniary interests, someone did, that's one, that I would expect such a donation to be declared, another would be that I would expect, particularly if the payment was in cash as was suggested in the transcript, that, that instead of what happened in the past where it was put into somebody's pocket, that the second test would be, that it be fully documented and accounted for in the normal accounting records of the electorate organisation of that member.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I made inquiries and I found, I was able to confirm that in fact, there had been a declaration of the donation by the member in his declaration of pecuniary interests, that furthermore the matter had not been placed in the members own funds, but had simply been passed on to the Electoral Executive Committee in the normal way that all donations are passed on, in various political organisations and in the Labor Party, and it was fully receipted and accounted for in the normal way.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, out of an excess of caution, but let me say out of an excess of caution, because one immediately becomes suspicious, one immediately becomes suspicious when somebody goes behind the back of their Minister in this way.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I decided to discuss the matter with the Chairman of the Criminal Justice Commission, Sir Max Bingham.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I laid the facts before him and Sir Max Bingham advised me that in his view, the member concerned had acted with complete propriety, complete propriety and acknowledged to me.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">And I remind you that Sir Max Bingham is a former Liberal member of parliament, and confirmed to me that it was a quite normal political donation that had been handled in a normal way that had been properly accounted for and was the subject of a pecuniary interest declaration.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">And I say in conclusion Mr Speaker this member is an absolute disgrace for raising a matter which she knows is before the court and the only reason it has not come out before now is because no other Queenslander would break the convention that this person has just broken by raising something that is before the courts and which has been before the courts over the course of the last two years.</PARA>

What I have incorporated is that material which was expunged from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questions were asked by the Leader of the Liberal Party in Queensland, Mrs Joan Sheldon, to Premier Goss. Premier Goss freely answered two questions from Mrs Sheldon that were very important in the public interest about the planned downfall of Police Commissioner Noel Newnham. At no time did Mrs Sheldon raise in her questions that these issues were before the court. The facts were that it was the Premier who chose to identify that these matters were before the courts. Despite that knowledge, he went on to answer the questions primarily to defend the former Police Minister, Mr Mackenroth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Mackenroth was the close Goss associate who had to resign from Cabinet after the Criminal Justice Commission alleged that he had misused his travel allowances. It was Premier Goss's response to those questions that raised more issues than they answered. These include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*  What the Police Commissioner told Mr Goss in February 1990 when he went to him with transcripts of a Federal Police intercept that revealed that Mr Mackenroth had received a $5000 payment from a person under police investigation who had been seeking to bribe taxation officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*  What did Mr Goss say to CJC Chairman Sir Max Bingham?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*  And was this the genesis of Labor's vendetta against the Queensland Police Commissioner, Noel Newnham?</PARA>
<PARA>There has been much ill-informed debate about this issue. There has been a range of arguments from some quarters that Mrs Sheldon had no right to raise this issue and that it should have been let lie. However, an examination of the transcript of the completed Coco trial showed why the Police Commissioner had reason to be worried about his new police Minister when he went to see the Premier in February 1990. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a direct quote from the Crown Prosecutor, Mr Weinberg, who told the trial of Mr Santo Coco in Brisbane earlier this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The material&mdash;that is the Mackenroth tape&mdash;discloses that between the 13th and 16th November 1989, there were several communications between Coco and Mackenroth by phone and in person.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Justice De Jersey of the Queensland Supreme Court then asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What did you say? It shows an attempt to confer a bribe on Mr Mackenroth?</PARA>
<PARA>The Crown Prosecutor, Mr Weinberg, replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It shows a willingness to have the money which has been handed over treated as a bribe.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Crown says it shows a willingness on the part of those two accused, who have handed over a sum of $5000 in cash, indeed a preference as far as Coco is concerned, to have that money retained as a bribe.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evidence contained in the Mackenroth material, however, shows that Coco was serious about having Vasta restored to the bench, and that Vasta was serious about having his position reviewed by the ALP when it came into government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Mackenroth conversations occurred between 13 and 16th November 1989 at the very same time as these two accused are allegedly engaged in a conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth by bribing the two tax officers to reverse sham transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(This was) in order to be able to shout from the rooftops before the election that Vasta was wrongly found to have engaged in sham transactions and the professed aim being to have him restored to the bench.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the conspiracy the Crown alleges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Coco was himself highly desirous of Mackenroth keeping the money without a receipt and treating it as a bribe.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They (Coco and Vasta) had an association which was far from innocent with Mr Mackenroth.</PARA>
<PARA>While I am aware that the Crown did not offer any evidence that Mr Mackenroth had knowingly accepted a bribe, it was clear that the former Police Minister was prepared to support the former Queensland Supreme Court judge, Angelo Vasta. In Parliament on 7 January 1989, the honourable member for Chatsworth, Mr Mackenroth, made a lengthy defence of Mr Vasta, when the then judge was ordered to the Bar of the House to give reasons why he should not have been removed from the Supreme Court bench. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of these circumstances Mr Newnham, the Police Commissioner, had been very concerned when he was handed a transcript of the Federal Police intercept of a conversation between the member for Chatsworth and Mr Coco. Even if Mr Mackenroth had not known that this $5,000 payment or donation or whatever they like to call it was meant as a bribe, it was an act of gross political stupidity by someone who was aspiring to become the Police Minister in Queensland in a few months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in my view, and I believe in the view of most Queenslanders, Mr Newnham was entirely justified in seeking a meeting with the Premier, Mr Goss, in February 1990 to discuss the transcript. He had a Police Minister who was clearly involved in a Federal Police investigation and may have been involved in a criminal trial. Mr Mackenroth was then the Police Minister who had the daunting task of introducing a raft of Fitzgerald reforms to clean up a police force and take on significant corrupt elements who were still in the Service. The fact that Mr Mackenroth was caught up in this investigation laid him open to serious compromise. If this transcript had fallen into the hands of corrupt elements of the Police Service, then the whole carriage of the Fitzgerald reforms would have been threatened. In Premier Goss's answer to a question by Mrs Sheldon on 8 May, the Premier said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Back in mid 1990 I am very sorry to say that the Police Commissioner came behind the Minister's back to see me. . . to hand to me. . . the Minister was overseas and as soon as he went away the Commissioner came to see me to show me a transcript indicating a certain individual. . . (and) the making of a donation to that member's election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA>Premier Goss made it clear in that answer that somehow he regarded it as improper for the Police Commissioner to see him about a matter of grave concern about his Police Minister. But what did the Premier suggest the Police Commissioner do with this material that he had come into possession of? Shred it? I expect this would probably be standard practice on these types of issues&mdash;destroy the evidence. Clearly it was from this point that this Labor Government decided that Commissioner Newnham was a loose cannon on the deck and that he had to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first public indication of this was when the details of an incident involving the Tasmanian driving licence of CJC Chairman, Sir Max Bingham, was leaked to the press. Then we saw the issue culminate in the ultimate display of sour grapes from the disgraced former Police Minister Mr Mackenroth, who made a number of extraordinary allegations against Mr Newnham, none of which could be proved. But, of course, Mr Mackenroth worked on the notion that if you throw enough mud, some of it will stick. For months Mr Newnham found himself in limbo, fighting for both his career and his reputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Premier brought special legislation to the State Parliament, supposedly to help Mr Newnham, but this was a public relations gesture. When the Police Commissioner was cleared by the Supreme Court, the Premier and his mates once again set about the task of seeking to destroy Mr Newnham and force him out of the job. What is most disturbing is that even details from the pecuniary interest files of Police Commissioner Newnham have been leaked to the press. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> of 17 May, there were clear details of Mr Newnham's financial affairs in what was clearly a politically motivated leak to embarrass him. The bottom line is that the Queensland police service was leaderless at a time when it was facing a crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Crime in Queensland is increasing by a general rate of about 25 per cent and, based on assaults per head of population, Queensland is, regrettably, the most dangerous place in Australia to live. What has happened to the war against corruption in the Police Service? The Government should ponder why police officers who have been investigated in the past or named at the Fitzgerald inquiry are openly cheering on the State Government's vendetta against Commissioner Noel Newnham. The public in Queensland is also wondering why the Government's thought police are working overtime to clean up the image of disgraced former Police Minister Mr Mackenroth while at the same time undermining the reputation of Police Commissioner Noel Newnham. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will be aware that the same question is currently in the public debate in the area of superannuation where, in some cases, outrageous undisclosed commissions were paid to advisers&mdash;at a level well above a reasonable fee commensurate with the amount of services actually provided. The Australian Investors Association has recently received a number of complaints about financial distress being suffered by a number of investors in relation to negative gearing investment schemes that were heavily promoted by the Advance and Challenge banks. The experience of three parties in particular has been as follows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first party is that of the so-called independent advisers who, in most cases, derive their income primarily from commissions and are in fact sellers of investment products who strongly recommend those investments that pay a high commission and denigrate other investments that would often be more suitable for investors. In the negative gearing schemes they earned commissions of up to 24 per cent of the investors' capital. For an investor with capital of $30,000 they would earn $7,200 for, at most, a few hours work, often done by people completely without qualifications in  accounting, finance or an allied field. By contrast, if they had recommended low risk investments they would earn commissions of about $300 and on medium risk investments they would earn $1,200 to $1,800. The second case is that of the banks, which derive large income from two sources: firstly, interest on loans which they probably would not have otherwise earned; and, secondly, entry fees and management fees from the property trusts managed by their subsidiary into which the investment was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third case is that of the hapless investors who suffered losses of up to 200 per cent of their capital. They now face margin calls to pay cash to the banks or to provide acceptable securities. In the event of their not being able to meet the margin calls, the whole of the debt which was scheduled for repayment two years or so ahead can become immediately due. The final result is that they could lose the investment&mdash;namely, the property trust units&mdash;and still owe to the bank an amount that may be as large as their original capital. That would mean that they would not have the option of continuing to hold the units in the hope that in time there might be a recovery in value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the investors had been made aware of the full extent of the risk they would face, the fact that they could lose more than 100 per cent of their capital and that the gearing multiplied the transaction costs of about 10 per cent to a figure of 40 per cent of their capital&mdash;so that an increase of less than 40 per cent in capital would mean a loss to the investor&mdash;the investors would have no cause for complaint. But they were not informed of those facts. The promotional material of the banks and their subsidiaries and the comments of the advisers made little, if any, reference to such risks. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">False statements were made to the effect that the expertise of the property trust managers and the ownership of prime, well located tenants would ensure that the properties would hold their values. But past experience has shown that prime, well located properties were not immune to capital decline of 40 per cent or more in market slumps that occur from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Banks have an obligation under the common law to ensure that people executing documents are aware of the nature of their obligations. As a result of court decisions, some banks, for example, will not allow people to sign a guarantee unless they have previously sought independent advice and can produce a letter from a solicitor confirming that this has been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the borrowers for negative gearing investments should have been made aware of the facts set out above, including the possible loss of over 100 per cent of capital and the fact that gearing could increase costs to 40 per cent of the capital. What makes the situation more significant is that some of the negative gearing investments were made in 1990 after the property slump had started, and after a decision of the NCSC meant that no unit holder in an unlisted property trust had an assured and unrestrained right to redeem units. The fact that clients may have been advised by a so-called independent adviser does not meet the obligation of the banks, because the very strong financial incentive for advisers to recommend negative gearing meant that their advice was not independent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One matter which these circumstances has brought to light is that the powers and jurisdiction of the banking ombudsman are inadequate. The ombudsman has no authority to act on claims against the subsidiaries of banks. I am not aware of whether this delineation is a deliberate one, but it does mean that a significant section of the financial system, which is controlled by the banks, is not covered by the excellent ombudsman arrangements. </PARA>

<TITLE>SURF SAFE Program</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the Senate's attention a program called SURF SAFE, which was previewed at a special showing last night, Wednesday, 19 August. Many of us are aware of the recent tragedy at Kiama on 11 July where seven people drowned. The importance of a program such as SURF SAFE has been demonstrated by this incident and a number of others which are becoming commonplace on the coastline of Australia. Such accidents are preventable, but we cannot expect people to use commonsense and a cautious approach to our beaches if there is not sufficient prior knowledge and education relating to the dangers of the ocean.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Jim Bradley, the honorary national surf survival certificate coordinator for the Surf Life Saving Association of Australia, designed SURF SAFE. SURF SAFE is an audiovisual program aimed at every 10-year-old Australian schoolchild. It must be noted that a major feature of rescues is that victims do not live adjacent to the coastline. Instead, they come from areas some distance away&mdash;in most cases, in excess of 50 kilometres. Another startling statistic is that 42 per cent of rescue victims are children under the age of 16. These figures have been carefully analysed and SURF SAFE has been designed to cover the bulk of potential victims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SURF SAFE will consist of a 23-minute video, achievement certificates and a number of theory exercises. The program is designed to cover a multitude of areas including types of waves, surf awareness, exploring rock shelves, coastal development, survival rules, the importance of obeying flags and alarms, assisting others and what to do in basic accident situations. SURF SAFE, it is hoped, will result in a dramatic decline in the number of rescues needed and the number of accidents that unnecessarily occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem lies not only in Kiama but all over Australia. It is impossible to rope or fence off the entire Australian coastline. To prevent accidents, we must increase and improve education relating to surf safety and awareness. We cannot afford such tragedies as that which happened at Kiama. The Surf Life Saving Association of Australia does its best to supervise and rescue thousands of people every summer. However, better education needs to be provided to Australians if we are to change the course of disaster along our coastline. Surfing and swimming are major developing areas in our culture, particularly among our young. SURF SAFE is a vital program, but it does rely on the support of the Federal Government and the residents of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Joanne Corbett, who is a year 10 student from Tamworth High School and who has been with me this week on work experience, has written this speech and she attended the presentation last night. We must make sure that education is good and if education of the surf could be as good as it has been for Joanne Corbett in the job that she has done for me this week in work experience, I am sure we will not have the tragedies we have had in the past. I appreciate the fact that she sat in the gallery tonight to listen to this speech and I thank her for the time she has spent working for me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to refer briefly to the deaths of three people, two of them being, in their different ways, outstanding Australians, and the other being a very impressive Australian by adoption. I refer in the first instance to Kenneth Myer and his wife, Yasuko, who died when their light plane crashed in Alaska a couple of weeks ago. Mr Myer had a reputation as an unconventional but a very caring leader of the Melbourne establishment who decided to move to Sydney. He spent, after standing down as Chairman of Myer Emporium, most of his time in Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kenneth Myer was born in San Francisco, the son of a Russian Jewish migrant who had business interests in Australia. His father's name originally had been Simcha Baevski, but he changed it to Sidney Myer. In 1929, Sidney Myer based his family in Australia and Kenneth, the eldest son, attended Melbourne Grammar and Geelong Grammar schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the war broke out in Europe, Kenneth Myer spent a year studying humanities at Princeton University in the United States before returning to Australia to join the Royal Australian Navy's anti-submarine service as a colleague in arms of my late father. He served in the Navy until 1946, attaining the rank of lieutenant and being awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the war Mr Myer joined the family business as a salesman and made several overseas trips to study retailing, becoming a Myer director in 1948 and then Chairman in 1966, a position he held for 10 years. After Myer's merger with Coles, he was a director of Coles Myer from 1985 to 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ken Myer presided over a big expansion of the company, as the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> has reported. Seeing it spread into Melbourne suburbs and branch out with the Target chain, he was obsessed, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> says, with new technology and innovation and, in 1970, he went to New York to accept the prestigious National Retail Merchants Association's international award. He was the first Australian to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A noted philanthropist, a trait which he acknowledged was inherited from his father, Mr Ken Myer headed the Sidney Myer Fund, founded by the Myer Foundation in 1959, and was President of the Howard Florey Institute of Experimental Physiology and Medicine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was, of course, one of Australia's foremost patrons of the arts, serving as a trustee of the Art Gallery of New South Wales since 1990 and Chairman of the Victorian Arts Centre Trust from 1969 to 1975. In the 1980s he donated a 200-hectare property he co-owned on the New South Wales south coast to the State Government. This has become a sanctuary for rare flora and fauna and is part of the Mimosa Rocks National Park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ken Myer shocked the conservative establishment in 1972 when he signed the letter from prominent Australians urging the election of a Whitlam Labor government after 23 years of coalition rule. This caused problems in his family, with his mother, Dame Merlyn Myer, contacting the then Liberal Prime Minister, Mr McMahon, to dissociate the family from her son's statement. I must say that at some stage later it was suggested that he may well have been an appropriate candidate to succeed Sir Paul Hasluck as Governor-General, but instead the ALP government of the time proposed Sir John Kerr for the position. It is interesting to speculate on whether history would have been a little different had Mr Myer been appointed to that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the election of the Hawke Government, Mr Myer was appointed chairman of the ABC, but he quit three years later after a controversial time as head of the national broadcaster. I last spoke with Mr Myer not so long ago at a dinner that my wife and I attended at the home of Robert and Angela Raymond. Ken and Yasuko were speaking with great enthusiasm about their up-coming fishing trip to Alaska, despite Yasuko's difficulty in travelling following an accident in which a four wheel drive vehicle had rolled on her. Mr Myer had some useful words of advice to me about appropriate government policies for the arts in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the age of 71, he was one of the most energetic, lively and intellectually stimulating people one could hope to be involved with. I know all Australians will regret his untimely passing and that of his very supportive and very close wife. They had been together for 15 years and were utterly inseparable. If Ken Myer was to die in a plane crash, I think it was right that Yasuko should be with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next person I will refer to is Ron Saw, who was an old journalist mate of mine from the 1950s and 1960s in Sydney where we worked together. As a tribute in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> recently said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was in every way larger than life&mdash;funny, generous, rambunctious, stubborn, gregarious, quick-tempered, quick-witted&mdash;and rated by contemporaries one of the best journalists Australia has seen.</PARA>
<PARA>He was a good mate and I must say that I had many lively times with him. I regret to say that in those days he had a glass jaw, which did not discourage him from expressing himself with more courage than sense in difficult situations&mdash;situations which I might say were often generated by his own ebullience when encouraged by a beer or two. At some stage he had worked for every proprietor in Sydney, having started off in Western Australia on the now defunct <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily News</EMPHASIS>. In Sydney he worked at different times for Sir Frank Packer, the Fairfaxes and Rupert Murdoch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He came to Sydney in the 1950s having been born in Western Australia into a stockbroking family. In fact, the family had held the number one seat on the Melbourne stock exchange&mdash;I think the name of the firm was Saw, Reid and Co. Ron, who was quite a good Aussie Rules footballer, had no intention of becoming a broker and got a job on the Perth <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily News</EMPHASIS> before coming to Sydney in the 1950s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the Sydney <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun</EMPHASIS>, which was then owned by the Fairfaxes, he went to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Mirror</EMPHASIS> and from there he moved to Sir Frank Packer's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>, where he wrote the Ray Castle column for many years, before moving on to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> where I worked as a columnist and editor of its `People' section. Ron Saw was laid low by a stroke in 1980. He fought back and wrote a series of articles about the experience, which won him the Journalist of the Year award and which eventually became an inspiration generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ron Saw and I had lunch here not so long ago to talk about how governments could play a more useful role in preventing strokes and helping recovery. He fought his stroke and it is reasonable to say he almost won, but not quite. In 1967, Ron Saw and his third wife, Ellie, left Sydney for Noosa from where he wrote columns for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS>. It was in Noosa at the age of 63 that he died just a week or so ago. I am certain all journalists will regret the passing of Ron Saw and will have remarkable memories of him. We convey to his wife and family deep commiserations for the passing of an exciting and outstanding Australian journalist. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reimbursement for air travel has been made on the basis of the applicable economy class fare.</PARA>
<PARA>I will come back to that in a moment. The next thing I wish to highlight is at the bottom of page 1. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have asked the Secretary of my Department to examine whether these errors have any broader implications for the Department's accounting and audit procedures and to report to me as soon as possible on this.</PARA>
<PARA>I will be interested, if it is possible, to hear the outcomes of that request, because it is quite obvious from what we have before us that that is very necessary. The third part of the letter which I wish to comment on&mdash;and the Minister raised it here tonight&mdash;reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you think it useful, I will arrange for officers of my Department to be available to go through the details of these expenditures.</PARA>
<PARA>I thank the Minister for that opportunity. I certainly will be taking it up and I look forward to doing just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a few comments beyond that in terms of what has been put down. Firstly, it is interesting to note in terms of the accounting procedures, that all the overpayments, other than one which was $7.60 to a Mr Wayne Misdale who was a guest speaker at the working party, were to the Western Australian Builders Labourers Federation. All other claims were correctly paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now return to the substance of the question that I asked on that particular day. I want to highlight precisely the so-called allegations that I made. I asked&mdash;and I reiterated it in the debate that night&mdash;`Why has the Minister approved payments of $2,267 and $634 for travel?' Possibly I could have been more technically correct and used the words `agreed to', but in essence they mean the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we turn to page two of the letter that was put on the table tonight, the Minister quite correctly now informs us that this amount has, of course, not been paid. In any event, only a return economy fare would be reimbursed. What I want to say about that, and my question&mdash;and in the debate on that night I said I did not know at that time whether they had been paid&mdash;is that it is quite clear from the letter dated 1 June 1992 that the Minister tabled, that it was the intention, at least on 1 June, that these claims should be paid. If not, the 1 June letter by his senior adviser to Mr Terry Brosnan is not an accurate reflection of the discussions that were held. I refer in particular to that letter entitled `Reimbursement of Travel&mdash;WABLF'. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have spoken to the Minister about this</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. He is of the view that these are legitimate expenses under the WATUAG arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. The meeting on 17 December was with the Minister and Stan Sharkey to review developments federally on the building reform strategy and forthcoming legislation on the BLF deregistration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;it was at our request and was important to the future of our reform efforts in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Grateful advice that funds are available.</PARA>
<PARA>As far as I am concerned, the question that I asked that day was legitimate. It was the intention from this memo that those funds should be paid. When those funds were not available, as we have been told through the Building Industry Working Group, an attempt was made to find out whether funds were available under the WATUAG agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have quite legitimate reason to believe that had I not asked that question that day, Mr Reynolds would have been paid. I also think it is fair to say that had I not asked that question, the accounting mistakes that were discovered and the overpayments that occurred would not have been picked up. I hope that the review of the accounting procedures will address and correct these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall leave my comments at that tonight. I stand by my assertion that my question was a legitimate one. There is no doubt that the intention was to meet the claims on these expenses. As I said, this is borne out by the letter of 1 June.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few brief comments tonight about a copy of a letter that has come to my attention. I understand that it is a letter that Senator Kernot has sent to a wide range of farm machinery dealers throughout Australia in connection with the discussion that has been taking place following the introduction by the Government in May of its sales tax simplification package, which we are in the process of debating in the Senate at the moment. There are a couple of points about the letter that I wish to draw to the attention of the Senate. I raise them following the extensive discussions that were held on this matter during the public hearings last week of the Senate select committee which is looking at the Government's sales tax package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To go back one step, there has been a concern amongst all the farm machinery dealers and, of course, their clients throughout Australia that one of the changes which appeared to have resulted from the sales tax simplification procedures was that farm machinery held by dealers would in fact be subject to a sales tax of 20 per cent or so, whereas previously that had not been the case and that machinery had been exempt. That was the subject of consideration by the Senate Select Committee on Sales Tax Legislation. That discussion of the Committee found that there appeared to have been a misunderstanding on the part of those people who had been advising the farm machinery dealers in regard to the effect of the sales tax simplification proposals. Indeed, the situation is, as we understand it on the basis of evidence from the Taxation Office officials and recorded in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Select Committee hearings which were held on 12 and 13 August last week, that there was a misunderstanding and that, in fact, the situation in practical terms is that there will be no change so far as farm machinery dealers and their equipment and parts are concerned from the situation now prevailing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was a matter which had concerned, certainly, the coalition which has received hundreds of representations Australia-wide expressing concern about the matter. I understand that it was also a matter that had been raised with the Australian Democrats. Senator Kernot, Senator Vanstone and I raised the issue at the Select Committee hearings last week and received the assurances that I have just explained to the Senate. Subsequently, Senator Kernot has written to all the farm machinery dealers saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Democrats support the current system of allowing retailers to purchase stock free of sales tax, where the eventual sale will be exempt from tax. I raised this matter with the Taxation Office officials at a public hearing of the Senate Select Committee on Sales Tax recently and they informed the Committee that the current situation will not change.</PARA>
<PARA>I have no quarrel with that paragraph in the letter&mdash;it is factually correct&mdash;other than just making it clear that it was not just the Democrats who raised this matter and had it flushed out at the public hearings of the Select Committee; it was a matter which the coalition had been pursuing very diligently as well. Whether we beat the Democrats to it or not, I do not know. But it would be unfortunate if there were any implication that the decision that the Taxation Office officials gave to the Committee last week was due to the Australian Democrats rather than to the coalition. I think that we both played a part in getting the right decision conveyed to us; that there had been a misunderstanding earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of Senator Kernot's letter concerns me a great deal more. She goes on to say to the farm machinery dealers who were the recipients of this letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think you should be aware that the GST will impose an automatic tax penalty on farm machinery dealers. That is, your business will be detrimentally affected by the GST in exactly the manner that you feared would happen under the new wholesale sales tax regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Fightback! documents, GST will be payable on all your stock purchases, including all transitional stocks held at the time of the introduction of the GST.</PARA>
<PARA>I can make only two comments about that letter. I can be charitable and say that Senator Kernot completely fails to understand the basic nature of a goods and services tax; or I could be a little uncharitable and say that she is deliberately setting out to mislead and concern the farming community in Australia&mdash;not only the farmers but also the dealers and distributors of farm machinery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope my uncharitable option is not correct. I think it is more likely, from what I have seen and heard of the Australian Democrats and a wide range of others in this Parliament, including&mdash;I am very surprised to say&mdash;a former Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, that there is a basic lack of understanding of the simple principles on which a goods and services tax or a value added tax operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to what Senator Kernot says in her letter, the GST does not apply to business inputs. There is no GST on business inputs. The whole of the goods and services tax is washed out of the production chain at each stage. That is why a goods and services tax is fundamentally different from a wholesale sales tax. A wholesale sales tax, by its very nature, gets caught up in the whole cost structure of the particular product that finishes up being sold. The goods and services tax, in complete contrast, gets excluded at every stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot has very gravely misinformed the recipients of this letter, who are the proprietors, as I understand it, of all the farm machinery distribution centres and networks throughout Australia. She has grossly misled them. She has told a factual untruth. I hope that Senator Kernot, being an honourable person, will take the opportunity now that I have raised this matter on behalf of the coalition to do the right thing and write another letter to every proprietor who has received this first letter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that she will be honest and admit to having made a mistake and that, contrary to her assertion in her first letter, the goods and services tax does not apply to business inputs and, therefore, will not apply to farm machinery and parts. I hope the concern that she has wrongly&mdash;I hope not wilfully&mdash;caused them will be corrected by a letter of apology for the error that she has made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of serious concern to me and the coalition that a political party that purports to try to follow issues in this country seems, through its senior spokesperson, not to have understood the first basic element of one of the major issues of debate in the Australian community today. I can only hope that the Democrats and the Labor Party may at last start to understand the basics of a goods and services tax or a value added tax so that they no longer continue to mislead the public in whatever they are saying on such a fundamentally important issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I turn to the matter that I want to raise, I wish to acknowledge the fact that the Australian Taxation Office has provided information to the Senate Select Committee on Sales Tax Legislation, as indicated by Senator Short. I have also been the recipient of some representations in respect of that matter. I had expressed my interest in it and I also examined the report when it was presented in the Senate. I wonder whether what the Taxation Office has said is sufficient for all time. I personally would like to see provisions in the legislation that would set at rest the minds of those in the agricultural machinery industry in particular, who made representations to me, to the Opposition, to the Democrats and, I suppose, also to the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I briefly want to advise the Senate that today something quite extraordinary happened in this House. Yesterday I became aware of the fact that six of the so-called Chinese boat people whose refugee status had been acknowledged by DILGEA had come to Canberra at the invitation of some Australian and Chinese friends. We all recall the quite remarkable stories of endurance which these people went through in November and December of last year in Western Australia before they were found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The true horror of the journey to Australia of these people is something that needs to be told at some stage. The horror of that journey was preceded by the great pressures that they were under in China. They are political dissidents. They have been persecuted in China. Because they expressed their views, a number of them were sacked from their jobs. They were pro-democracy supporters. One of them was a leader of the students in one of the major cities in south China and addressed pro-democracy meetings. Prior to the commencement of their journey, they were in hiding. The Chinese security police were seeking them out. That is some of the background. Today I invited them to come to Parliament House and invited senators and members to be present to hear some of their stories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, they are grateful for those who have supported them since their arrival in Australia, and they are of course grateful to Australia. But I have to say that we were also briefed by the President of the Indo-Chinese Refugees Association. She was able to give us some quite startling information regarding the treatment of these people at the hands of Australian authorities after they arrived here and for the succeeding months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This information, of course, has come from a number of sources. It has been crosschecked and double-checked. The person who provided us with the information is a most honourable person whose integrity, honesty and reliability is unquestioned. All I want to say at this moment is that I am aware that a brother of one of these persons who has been granted refugee status had been refused refugee status and rejected by the Refugee Status Review Committee on the grounds that the information that was on the file was rather scanty relating to that individual's claim for refugee status. But if the information that we have is true&mdash;and it has been double-checked&mdash;that person when he came to Australia was subject to what can only be described as mental cruelty bordering on the shameful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department has now been supplied with information which should convince it that this person was in absolutely no condition to confidently provide information to the officials in the manner in which it was demanded&mdash;because of that person's fear, because of that person's isolation, because of the denial to that person initially of the type of representation that was required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply wish to flag the fact that I and a number of senators and members are very interested now in all of these cases. I believe this will be of great interest to this chamber, particularly to those members and senators who have had a long involvement in upholding the basic human rights of individuals. It is important to Australia to actually uphold, and to be seen to uphold, the defence of human rights in the finest tradition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not keep the Senate long. I, too, wish to raise with the Senate a matter relating to a letter which Senator Cheryl Kernot has apparently written to, I understand, not just hundreds but perhaps thousands of proprietors of farm machinery businesses around Australia. In this letter she says that the goods and services tax, as set out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> documents, will be payable on stock purchases, including all transitional stocks held at the time of the introduction of the goods and services tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I discussed this matter with my colleague Senator Short before he spoke earlier this evening. I said to him that it is quite clear that Senator Kernot does not understand what a goods and services tax is all about. I hope all senators understand that it is a tax on final consumption and that taxes on business inputs are rebatable. So there is not any tax as such. Even though it may be imposed in the first instance, it is then rebatable at the time the goods are sold. I said to Senator Jim Short, `Perhaps she just doesn't understand. Perhaps you could explain it'. As a result of a conversation I had with one of her colleagues this evening, in which he indicated to me that there are many thousands of letters and that she does understand it, as does he, I believe she quite deliberately left out the business about it being rebatable. The attitude of the Australian Democrats is: when these farm machinery agents panic about the Fightback goods and services tax and contact Opposition members, they will be able to explain to them that it is rebatable. So Senator Kernot has quite deliberately set out to mislead all of these people. </PARA>

I must say that if Senator Kernot, who appears to be a reasonable, decent and sensible citizen and who appears to be a reasonable, decent and sensible senator, is prepared to write such a letter as this in order to quite deliberately mislead people, I take it all back, and I call her a cheat and liar. </PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="474" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator Bolkus</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been advised that the answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Since 1987, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has received numerous requests from Senators and Members for  electoral roll data to be provided in electronic form. The Government's recent decision to do so directly resulted from requests by the Presiding Officers' Information Technology Advisory Group (POITAG) at its meetings in December 1990 and March 1991. Those requests did not specify WordPerfect as a required format.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The decision to offer the option of 386-class computers, as part of a wider offer of additional equipment for electorate offices, was taken in October 1990. It was subsequently decided to upgrade all electorate offices to a three personal computers/two printers configuration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Not specifically, but the October 1990 decision and subsequent implementation of the three personal computers/two printers configuration anticipated a likely need to accommodate increasingly more sophisticated software packages in electorate offices; the electoral roll database is an example of that growing requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Each Senator has been offered the provision of the databases for two of the House of Representatives Divisions, as nominated by them, in their State or Territory; a list of the Divisions so nominated is at Attachment 1. Each Member  has been provided, as a standard issue, with an electronic version of the electoral roll for their Division, as determined by the most recent redistribution of boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) As at 31 July 1992, and since the electoral roll databases have been available for Senators and Members, sixteen Members have requested two databases; the details of those requests and of their outcomes are at Attachment 2.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) &amp; (8) The data is being supplied in ASCII format and is capable of being transcribed to, for example, the Open Access software supplied to electorate offices as a standard database package. There has been no direct expenditure on the computer program to do the necessary data conversion; it has been developed using existing staff resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) While there are no physical means of preventing the merger of the electoral roll databases provided to Senators and Members with other software programs, s.91A of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 sets out the purposes to which the information provided by the AEC to authorised persons may be put. Advice of those purposes, together with a warning that the Commission claims copyright on the enrolment information provided by it, was notified to all Senators and Members at the time the databases were first provided to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) Section 91B of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 prohibits such disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) My Department does not have access to the computer programs referred to and therefore, is not in a position to assess their compatibility with the electoral roll database.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) No. What is being provided is in accordance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. It is the same data as is available for public inspection or purchase from the Australian Electoral Commission.</PARA>
