<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Leader of the Government in the Senate to reports over the weekend that the Keating Government knew about the former Victorian Labor Government's action to breach the Loan Council borrowing limits before it was formally advised on 17 June. I ask: did any Government Minister or any of its officials have any discussions, formal or informal, by phone or otherwise, with the Victorian Labor Government or its officials before 17 June; and, if so, when? Did Treasurer Dawkins or any other Minister or any official receive a draft letter from the then Victorian Treasurer, Tony Sheehan, before 17 June; and, if so, when? Will the Government now release all minutes, notes and correspondence on this issue?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Together with the Democrats, the Opposition has initiated an inquiry into the question of Loan Council borrowings and the future arrangements which might be appropriate in respect of Loan Council borrowings. That has been the subject of much debate and I suppose Opposition members will get the opportunity to ask questions about this matter at that inquiry if it misdirects itself into questions of the past as distinct from what the appropriate arrangements ought to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, having said that, as Senator Short would also have seen, the Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Cole, made some comments about this in the press. I have not discussed that matter with Mr Cole but, as I recall, he said that the Treasury officials were handed a copy of a draft letter, undated, from Victoria on 17 June. As I recall the press reports, that is what Mr Cole said, and he dealt with one or two other matters which are the subject of Senator Short's question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know what phone discussions took place from time to time between various Ministers in the Government and various Victorian Ministers in the period to which Senator Short refers. I know that I have discussions at the present time with various Ministers in the present Victorian Government about various matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that Ministers from time to time had such discussions in the period of the former Government in Victoria but, of course, I could not make any comment about that; I do not know what discussions took place. But the burden of Senator Short's question must be whether any discussions took place about the Victorian Loan Council borrowings. I do not believe that to be the case, but I will check that.</PARA>

Senator Alston is, as I understand it, a member of the committee which has been established and I imagine he will have plenty of time to pursue any issues he wants to on that committee. I also make the point that this question Senator Short has asked me was based on a press report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. The fact of the matter is that I do not rush around getting briefings on every press report that appears in a newspaper, particularly, as I was trying to point out, when it seemed to be wrong. It seemed to be wrong on the express statement of the Secretary to the Treasury. That is the context in which I answered the question, and it is the context in which I answered the supplementary question.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Communications. Is the Minister aware of recent discussions between Australia and Singapore on future air services?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to advise the Senate of the outcome of the very successful negotiations which were held between Australia and Singapore last week. For the first time now, multiple designation has been agreed for the carriers of both countries. As well, airlines of both countries will have the opportunity to introduce an additional 26 services per week by 1995, which represents almost a 50 per cent increase in the capacity on this route.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in capacity negotiated will provide significant capacity for allocation by the International Air Services Commission to meet the requirements of new entrants and the future growth on this route. Australian carriers will also be able to operate through Jakarta, with enhanced traffic rights, and to serve Kuala Lumpur en route. Traffic right connections to Vietnam and Cambodia have also been secured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Singapore Airlines has also been given permanent authority to operate a second weekly freighter service into Australia effective immediately, and a third service from 1994. This is welcome news indeed for Australian export and import industries. With the finalisation of this agreement, Australia now has multiple designation rights under all of its existing air service agreements in South East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of these new arrangements with Singapore for the tourism industry cannot be underestimated. For example, for the year ended 31 December 1991, Singapore figured in three of the top 10 city pair routes to Australia. Singapore's role as a major transit point in Asia is well known. With the finalisation of this new air services agreement, Australia is well placed to take advantage of the expected large growth in passengers and freight in the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and relates to the Victorian loans scandal. Why is it that although the Treasury was aware from 17 June of the borrowings breached by the Victorians, it was not until 6 July, apparently, that the Treasury bothered to inform the Treasurer or his office? Does the Minister seriously expect us to believe that it is normal practice for the Treasury to wait almost a month before advising the Treasurer of breaches of this magnitude? Finally, why was the draft letter, to which reference has already been made, not included in documents previously released by the Treasurer in relation to the Victorian loans scandal? What other drafts, aide-memoires and documents are yet to come?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GG4">Senator FOREMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook. Has the Minister received any information from the International Labour Organisation about Australian industrial relations law being inconsistent with the ILO convention on freedom of association which has been adopted by Australia? What is the Government's attitude towards ILO conventions? Is the Minister aware of any current proposals on industrial relations that would be in conflict?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2473" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS; SHIPPING AND AVIATION SUPPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The International Labour Organisation is the oldest agency of the United Nations. As I recall, it was formed in 1917 and has continued in various guises since. It is tripartite in nature. Its conventions have the approval of employers, workers and governments around the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia adopted the ILO convention concerning freedom of association 19 years ago, and has adhered to it ever since. The supervising committee of the ILO&mdash;the committee of experts; a body of jurists of international repute&mdash;last year asked Australia to re-examine its domestic industrial relations law. It held that the existence in this country of tort law on industrial relations and of sections 45D and E of the Trade Practices Act were in breach of the ILO convention I have referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, it held that the New South Wales essential services legislation was drawn in such a way as to define services that were not essential in the bracket of `essential' and, thus, bring into the coverage of essential services, work and responsibilities that were not properly there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to cut off any interjections or points of order, may I say that the Australian Government is the affiliate of, and has the responsibility of answering to, the ILO on these matters. Given the ILO's expression of view on sections 45D and E, it is interesting to note that in the Jobsback&mdash;properly called `Jobsack'&mdash;policy announced by the Opposition on 22 October, Mr Howard indicated quite clearly that he would continue the existence of sections 45D and E even though those provisions are found to be in contravention of the international labour law. He has also expressed the view that common law liability would obtain in Australia which, again, is in contravention of international labour law as declared by the ILO, and which Australia is bound to observe, given its adoption of those conventions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area where one needs to look is the essential services area. I have already indicated what the finding of the jurists, the committee of experts, has been with respect to the New South Wales legislation in that area. It is clear that the Kennett Vital Industries Bill is in flagrant breach of most of the provisions of that convention, and Australia would get a black mark if that legislation were carried. If one looks at the `Jobsack' proposal, there is an imitation of the Vital Industries Bill in that being proposed by the Opposition for the national government. If that were carried, that would be in breach as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer him to the Prime Minister's pledge not to oppose the coalition's goods and services tax if Labor loses the next election. I ask the Minister: first, what, if any, is the constitutional basis of Mr Keating's claim that `the Senate has no right to obstruct the principal policies of the government in the lower House in which that party was elected to government'? Secondly, does he agree that the Constitution clearly sets out that that legislation must gain the assent of both Houses before it becomes law? Thirdly, does he further agree that Mr Keating's highly uncharacteristic promise to forgo the use of powers at his disposal is aimed solely at manipulating the Australian electorate in a desperate bid to retain government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they have. They might not do it. The Prime Minister said that the Opposition was wedded to the GST. If people get the Opposition, they get the GST as well. That would be a terrible thing on both counts&mdash;getting the Opposition and getting the GST. That is what he said. That is an impeccable statement of the reality of it all. We do not know what the Opposition will do on the basis of the experience in my State of Victoria, where all sorts of things have been implemented which were not contained in the Opposition's policy speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the election of 1975 I recall that members of the Democrats in this place, led by Don Chipp, had to sign a pledge not to oppose a principal financial measure or Supply in the Senate. That is what they used to have to do. There is not much technical distinction between the two. We are talking about the Opposition's $40 billion package, including $27 billion worth of new taxes to be imposed on the Australian people. That is clearly a centrepiece of any Opposition proposal. The people of Australia know that if the Opposition is elected here they will cop that in terms of prices of food and clothing and all sorts of things which are not now subject to taxation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact that 113 Chinese boat people who arrived at Christmas Island on 30 October were sent back to China. They were sent back after being interviewed by experienced and senior officers of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. During those interviews it became apparent that these boat people had been the victims of a very unscrupulous racket: they had been tempted and duped into believing that if they made their way to Australia they would achieve a better life for themselves by securing employment, perhaps being able to bring their families out and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill's shadow Minister has put out a press release saying that the Government had acted properly in the decision it had taken in regard to the 113 arrivals on Christmas Island. The way in which these people were dealt with so speedily probably came as something of a surprise to the Australian people, but it happens constantly at airports. When people arrive at airports without proper documentation&mdash;with no legal basis for their entry to Australia&mdash;they are turned around very quickly through the international terminals, as the Minister for Transport and Communications would know. Where people have no legal basis on which to remain here, they will be turned around as quickly and as practicably as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>

Departmental officials assessed that they were not asylum seekers. The Government cannot condone attempts to enter Australia through queue jumping, and the message to be taken back to those who might be duped into entering or tempted to enter into similar schemes is that they should not undertake such a perilous voyage without the very firm prospect of being turned around as soon as possible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite reasonable that the Opposition should ask the Government a question about industrial relations of this character because the Government's record on industrial relations is vastly superior to that of the Opposition. Indeed, if one compares the level of industrial disputation during the period of our Government with the period of the Fraser Government, one will see that there has been a 62 per cent reduction in industrial disputation in Australia during our tenure of office compared to the Opposition's tenure of office.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support inform the Senate whether the Government will instigate an immediate review of Civil Aviation Authority regulations which, since being amended 12 months ago, only require private pilots to lodge details of their flight departure and arrival points and not their specific routes? Is the Minister aware that searchers for two Tasmanians tragically lost in a recent light plane crash in northern Tasmania claimed that their lack of knowledge regarding the plane's intended flight path seriously hampered the search? Does the Government recognise that the lack of vital flight path information in the form of a flight plan may mean the difference between life and death during times of aviation emergency and that this position cannot be allowed to continue? Is this the CAA's policy of `affordable safety' in practice?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The CAA makes the regulations based on the best knowledge that it has at the time, being the responsible authority in Australia in managing the proper legal and regulatory regime for air traffic control and flying. In the case of the Tasmanian incident that Senator Calvert has referred to, it is my understanding that the pilot of that aircraft made arrangements to radio to the tower, at Hobart I think, when they were crossing from the land in Tasmania over the coast into the sea area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the radio call did not come through, there was an expectation that something serious had befallen the aircraft and arrangements were then made. So even if a flight plan had been lodged in the case of this incident, as Senator Calvert's question implies it ought to have been, nothing different behaviourally would have occurred in terms of early warning or notice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To draw a general conclusion from one occasion is not appropriate. Of course, the CAA does keep a constant monitoring brief on the effect of its regulations and whether those regulations are appropriate. I expect it to do that on this occasion. If Senator Calvert wishes me to obtain for him a more detailed explanation by the CAA about what it is doing in response to this particular incident, I will be delighted to do so.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the Minister, but what I was saying is that the criticism of the searchers was that no flight plan was lodged to give them any indication of the direction in which the plane was heading. The Minister referred to the pilot raising the matter when he went across Bass Strait; that was his regular habit. The point I am trying to make is that a flight plan would indicate in which direction the plane was heading. There were several different directions in which it could have been going. I was asking Senator Cook, as the responsible Minister, whether he could look again at the regulations as they stand.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is a bipartisan point of view. Under the Opposition's proposals, as I understand them, the same would apply. I will obtain from the CAA an answer in more detail and see whether there is a way of answering the issues that Senator Calvert has raised.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have the exact transcript in front of me, but I do believe there was some comment to that effect from Senator Knowles challenging the Government, which seemed to come ill from her mouth. Not only is the Opposition proposing that Australians fund the health scheme through ordinary taxation contributions and the Medicare levy, but also it wishes to add to the tax and Medicare levy contributions the payment of private health insurance premiums as a compulsory feature of the funding of health and hospital care throughout Australia. So there will be three elements which the ordinary person and household in Australia would have to face if Fightback were ever implemented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to ameliorate the effect on those in the community earning very low incomes, it is proposed by the Opposition that some sort of subsidy be offered. However, the hundreds of millions of dollars to fund that subsidy will come direct from the cutback in expenditure on the public hospital system which, unfortunately, will also be part of the Fightback policy. If 5 per cent of funds are taken away from the States, the States will find it very difficult to allocate sufficient funds to the public hospital system. The hundreds of millions of dollars that will be saved by the Opposition in that regard may be used to mask the real pain of the compulsory private health insurance premium that the Opposition would require to be paid by every Australian and every Australian household.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe there should be direct payment into the public hospital system. That is what is being proposed by the Minister, Mr Brian Howe, by way of the transfer of many tax dollars into the public hospital system to help reduce waiting lists, to help to build up that hospital system to one where all Australians can find equitable access to decent health care.</PARA>

In this way, we believe we will ensure that the black economy does not get laundered into the white economy, not only in a way which would further allow the accumulation of assets by those engaged in criminal activities, but in a way which would distort the legitimate business and commercial activities of Australians who are honestly trying to run their businesses.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government has admitted for the first time that it has a Medicare problem. . . The major problem with Medicare from the public hospital sector's perspective has been the increased numbers of `free' public patients and the decline in `paying' private patients. . . There are limits to how much efficiency can be forced without affecting patient access and quality of care. . . A fully public funded system controls costs effectively through an explicit cap on hospital budgets. However, the limits on raising taxpayer funds inevitably leads to more service rationing, longer waiting lists and stifles innovation in technology and management.</PARA>

There is no magic pudding. Senator Tate disregards the whole basis of the system, which was invented long before Medicare came into existence and which really brought out the high standard of hospital care that has been afforded to this country, both in public and in private. By continuing the line of garbage that he is giving us now and pretending that there is no problem there at all is a disservice to this Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator West this day, relating to the aviation industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins in his answer quoted from a speech that I had made to the Regional Airlines Association of Australia on 24 September 1992 and claimed that I had been inconsistent in that speech. The speech was about the GST and its application to aviation, not about aviation policy as such. Senator Collins's answer shows not only how ignorant he is of the coalition's policies but also how misleading he can be and how ignorant he is of some of the basic terms that are used in aviation policy. Senator Collins claimed that I had said that the coalition's policy on aviation was an open skies policy. Senator Collins pointed to the part of the speech which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While Qantas will remain our designated flag carrier and initially have the right to reject operating under any new agreements, the Coalition will be prepared to license additional Australian carriers for these overseas routes should Qantas not wish to operate such services.</PARA>
<PARA>He left out the other words in the paragraph, which were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will maximise Australia's potential earnings on new routes.</PARA>
<PARA>Where Senator Collins made his fatal mistake in trying to draw a distinction between the paragraphs in the speech to which I have referred was that he wrongly quoted the first of my comments. He claimed that I was talking about an open skies policy. I was not talking about an open skies policy, because that is not the coalition's aviation policy. The coalition's aviation policy in this respect is to `open up the skies of Australia with the 100 per cent privatisation of Qantas; we will allow a very liberal approach to the granting of international air rights'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a vast difference between opening up the skies and having an open skies policy. I do not know what the Government's policy is on that matter, but I repeat that the coalition's policy is to open up the skies of Australia. I find it absolutely incredible that a person who comes in here and parades as knowing so much about his own policies and purports to know so much about the coalition's policy and gets it wrong should, first, find need to misrepresent the coalition's policy and, secondly, seemingly be so ignorant that he does not know the basic difference between those two key phrases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that it was an honest mistake on the part of Senator Collins. After seeing some of his performances over recent times, I have to say that that stretches the credibility a little. I hope that, if it were an honest mistake, Senator Collins will come in here and apologise to me and to the Senate for such a deliberately misleading statement. More particularly, he owes it to himself to come and tell the Senate that he really is not quite as ignorant on some of things as he appears to be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought that Senator Button might wish to defend the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in some way. Bruce Jones wrote this in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> on 8 November after last week's events:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One large ALP senator was overheard in a conversation to refer to the Prime Minister as `that clown'.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is the sentiment of the Prime Minister's colleagues in this place after the events of last week, at least those opposite are waking up. Perhaps that explains why nobody objected to that unparliamentary comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I am disturbed by your answer today. The implication of what Michelle Grattan said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and I will not read it again&mdash;suggests that your explanation to the Senate last week for taking no action was not valid. In other words, you said that you felt that you could not take action because to do so would be to intervene in a political matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears from her statement in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> that you liaised with the Prime Minister as to what action you should take. He had later expressed something to you in terms that were, to use her words, `euphemistically described as colourful'. When you then said that you might have to write a letter on behalf of honourable senators and you got a response from the Prime Minister saying, `Shove it', you decided not only not to act but also to put out a statement in this place saying that you could not act because to do so would be to act politically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today when I asked you to clarify the matter, Mr President, in view of what Michelle Grattan had written at the weekend, in effect you refused to do so, and I find that disturbing.

We regret that last week you were not prepared to do so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been an escalation in the abuse by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of this chamber. When he spoke to some school children at his old school in Sydney, he denigrated the Senate. This led to criticism in this chamber of the Prime Minister. Later a Senate inquiry was appointed to look into the misconduct of his Treasurer and his own Government in the loans affair in Victoria. The Prime Minister chose to abuse the Senate by calling it `unrepresentative swill'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not coming from nowhere; it is in the context of the Prime Minister resenting the Senate and its powers to investigate his failures and mistakes. I have heard what was written in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> about your own conversation with him, Mr President. If the Prime Minister dares to say to the President of the Senate anything that is compromising of this Parliament, the constitution of the Senate or respect for you as President of the Senate, then he stands in even worse contempt than the contempt with which the people of Australia regard him at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no light matter for it even to be alleged that the Prime Minister of this country is abusing the President of the Senate when he is approaching him in good faith. No-one has questioned your integrity at all, Mr President, even in the Opposition's questioning of the phrasing of your statement to us on the last sitting day. No-one would suggest that a leak of this kind, right or wrong, could have come from you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister of this land is constantly leaking material to newspapers. It is in the context of an escalation of his attack on the Senate that he would have the gall to allow such a leak and give such a story to a highly credible journalist, Michelle Grattan, and allow her to write such an article. If any independent witness can show that the Prime Minister tried to make some statement to the President of this chamber that went even mildly in this direction, then the Prime Minister deserves a double censure from the Senate. </PARA>

Senator Button is very interested in this point. I met with hundreds of people during a very busy weekend and attended many community functions and other meetings.

There is no Senate inquiry into the misconduct of the Treasurer. That is part of the propaganda that the Opposition has sought to make in respect of this inquiry when, of course, the important comment of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was that the Opposition was engaged in a political stunt&mdash;which it is.</PARA></TALK.START>

In contrast to the smoking infringement notice system also established by these by-laws, the fines system does not set out the level of the fines or, for example, the currency in which such fines might be paid. The Committee has in mind here transit passengers who may be unable to pay a fine in Australian currency. It would also be interested to establish what steps would be taken if a person were unable or unwilling to pay the fine.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Loosley</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 17 September 1992 in which you drew my attention to a number of matters arising from the Committee's consideration of the Federal Airports Corporation Regulations (Statutory Rules 1992 No. 255) (the Regulations) and the Federal Airports (Amendment) By-laws No. 1 1992 (the By-laws).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I confirm that the matters raised in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of your letter are indeed typographical errors within the Regulations and thank the Committee for drawing them to my attention. Although these matters affect neither the clear intention nor the validity of the Regulations, I would propose that they be corrected when the Regulations are next amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to the second matter you raised in relation to the Regulations, namely the apparent width of the power of delegation, I am advised that the only delegates to date are the General Manager, Sydney Airport and the Manager, Technical Services at Sydney Airport. Both of these people have detailed knowledge of the project, the environmental impact statement and the recommendations of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (as she then was). Due to the environmental sensitivity of this project, the Corporation does not intend to delegate powers under the Regulations to any persons other than senior managers who have direct personal knowledge of the project requirements and environmental processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the By-laws, I advise that the smoking infringement fine and notice systems work in tandem. The various offences and penalties are spelt out in by-laws 15G.2, 15G.4 and 15G.8. Where a person breaches by-law 15G.2 (smoking in a terminal building) the airport officer may proceed by way of a smoking infringement notice only. However, where a person breaches by-law 15G.4 (failure to answer questions relating to identity) or 15G.8 (failure to comply with a direction to extinguish smoking materials) the airport officer may proceed by way of a smoking infringement fine, payable immediately. In each case, the penalties are spelt out in the relevant offence provisions, namely, by-laws 15G.2, 15G.4 and 15G.8. The system of penalties under the By-laws has not been established under any other instrument of delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As with all Australian statutes, the penalties are payable in Australian currency. As you would be aware, all Australian international airports have facilities for the exchange of foreign currency. In any event, the fact that penalties are payable in Australian currency would not preclude an airport officer accepting payment in foreign currency to an equivalent value.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, you have sought my advice as to what steps would be taken if a person were unable or unwilling to pay the fine. This would clearly depend upon the particular circumstances of the breach. However, in the case of a recalcitrant smoker the FAC's ultimate sanction would be to refer the matter to the Federal Police as it would any other criminal act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope that the above information is of assistance to your Committee.</PARA>

I noticed that one senator is quoted by Bruce Jones in last weekend's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS>. Bruce Jones put the senator's words into quotes; he is a reputable journalist, so I am sure the quote would be accurate. He said that one senator said to him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we lose government, Keating&mdash;even assuming he is still around&mdash;isn't going to have much of a say in what we do.</PARA>
<PARA>That comment is said to have come from one senior ALP senator at the end of last week. We know that the ALP Caucus members were taken by surprise in this announcement by the Prime Minister, but this will give them the opportunity to stand up today and say, `We agree with the Prime Minister that a coalition government should be supported in its Fightback program because the people would have given it the mandate to implement that program'. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure Senator Cooney will stand there and support it. Why is it urgent? It is urgent because we are about to have a Federal election and the Australian people are entitled to know whether this is just the view of the Prime Minister or whether the Caucus is going to support him. Why is that important? It is important because tax reform will, as this motion indicates, give the opportunity for personal income tax to be reduced by 30 per cent. Fightback provides for personal income tax in this country to be reduced by 30 per cent&mdash;the largest income tax reduction in Australia's history. It will enable wholesale sales tax, payroll tax and the tax on fuel to be abolished. The wholesale sales tax, much recognised for its inefficient structure, payroll tax, which is a tax on jobs, and the tax on fuel, which particularly hurts those in rural Australia and small businesses, will all be abolished. That is included in the Fightback program and it is part of the benefit of the restructuring of tax. This tax reform will enable family allowances to be doubled for lower income families and it will require that tax cheats bear a fairer share of the tax burden.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the restructuring of the taxation system is all about and that is what can be achieved with an implementation of the coalition's Fightback program. It is therefore urgent that Labor Party senators in this place stand behind the Prime Minister and indicate that in opposition they would be prepared to support the Fightback program. That is why we bring forward this motion today and that is why it is urgent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not really surprising for us to hear that the Prime Minister, in some ways, did not hold such a strong objection to a goods and services tax or to consumption taxes generally because he has previously supported those taxes. I am going to spend a little time today, Mr Acting Deputy President, reminding you of the occasions on which the Prime Minister has supported a goods and services tax in this country because it demonstrates the hypocrisy of this man and it demonstrates really where he does stand on the economic issue of whether this tax reform is in the best interests of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it not amazing? There could be no other person in this Parliament who could get up and say, on the one hand, `In opposition we will support this tax'; yet, on the other hand, describe it as a vile tax. Who else could flick the switch in the way Mr Keating can? We never can be absolutely sure where his genuine belief lies; whatever is most politically opportune at the moment is what we get from Mr Keating. He obviously decided the other day that political opportunism required him to make this statement as to what the Labor Party would do in opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can go back in history to the time when he was formulating the tax policy and look at what he said about the need for Australia to have a goods and services tax. In 1985 he was taking the running on the issue; he got rolled in the end by the trade union movement in concert with some of the social security lobby groups. Nevertheless, he made it absolutely unambiguously clear that it was in Australia's best interests to have a consumption tax, to have a goods and services tax, to have a VAT, in other words, to broaden the tax base in this way&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Ferguson interjected, Mr Keating wished to broaden the tax base without exemptions. I am going to remind honourable senators specifically what he had to say on that matter. He started this process on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program on 12 May 1985, when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of tax reform is unambiguously to redistribute the burden of taxes, not to facilitate an increase in that burden.</PARA>
<PARA>He recognised the need in this country to redistribute the burden of taxes. In an interview on 4 June 1985, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we don't as a nation adopt this proposal (option C)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that was his option for a consumption tax&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">then you won't see significant reform in this country in taxation for the balance of this century.</PARA>
<PARA>He said on 4 June 1985 that unless we implement a consumption tax as part of the restructuring of taxation in this country, then we will not see decent taxation reform for the balance of this century. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would result in a manifestly fairer tax system, and would create the foundations for a more efficient system to promote stronger economic growth and higher living standards.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is Mr Keating, the Prime Minister, defending the need for a restructuring of the tax system to include a consumption tax because it is necessary to develop, in his words:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a more efficient system to promote stronger economic growth and higher living standards.</PARA>
<PARA>That is everything the coalition is saying which he now condemns because he has flicked the switch of political opportunism. It is now not to his political advantage to support these statements, so he has flicked the switch and taken a different point of view. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we'd use every cent of the proceeds to provide significant tax cuts and to increase benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>That is Mr Keating; that is not Dr Hewson. While I am on that subject, it reminds me of the mischief that this Government is talking about our tax proposals as additional taxes. I think we heard it from Senator Button today in Question Time. Fightback is a program that reduces the tax take in this country by about $6 billion. It restructures the taxation system from within, but it substantially reduces taxation. Fightback is a low tax program and it is important that the Australian people know that. They should not believe what Senator Button says, or members of the Government who, for purposes of political opportunism, simply suggest something else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to what the now Prime Minister Keating was saying in 1985. I remind honourable senators of his speech to the National Press Club on 5 June of that year. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is now well recognised that the Australian tax system is unfair. It is also widely appreciated that it encourages inefficiency and is extraordinarily complex.</PARA>
<PARA>What has changed? Nothing has changed. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly, there is a need for action: for reform.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that we must commit ourselves to a number of different propositions, the first of which is that the tax base must be broadened. Here he is again, endorsing the principle of broadening the tax base through some form of value added tax, as practically every other industrialised country in the world has done. It is not surprising that he was standing with all of the rest of the industrialised world. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the ideals of tax reform require us to commit ourselves to lower marginal tax rates.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Fightback program. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">we should attempt to use the tax system to solve every problem that looks too difficult to solve in some other way.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to state something which I particularly want to remind the Senate about. He put down what he saw as the third main advantage of Australia's adopting a consumption tax. I remind the Senate that this is Mr Keating, the now Prime Minister of Australia, who was putting down these reasons which he said made out the case for a consumption tax for Australia. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, it will allow a more rational indirect tax system than the current anomaly-ridden wholesale tax . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He is the one who is now saying the wholesale sales tax is perfect. He was saying in 1985, as we do now, and as every reasonable, objective person says, that it is full of anomalies. He went on to say that it could replace the anomalous wholesale sales tax system which had allowed multiple rates and numerous exemptions and which failed to tax the services sector. He is now going to condemn us for taxing services and in 1985 he was saying it was necessary for Australia to tax services if it was to catch up with the rest of the world in having an equitable and efficient taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then went on to his second reason for a consumption tax in this country. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, it will enable us to generate tax revenues to provide for a major reduction in the marginal rates of income tax.</PARA>
<PARA>This, I remind honourable senators again, is Fightback. If you broaden the tax base, you can get income tax marginal rates down. That is why we can reduce income tax across the board by about 30 per cent&mdash;as I said a minute ago, the largest income tax reductions in Australia's history. We are going to broaden the base of taxation and in 1985 Mr Keating endorsed that as the only way to go in the best interests of Australia. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No other tax has the same potential for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA>He was right again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third reason he gave for supporting a consumption tax was that it generates tax from those who will continue to evade or avoid income tax. What have we said? Catch the tax cheats. We have said that in a motion today, and what was Mr Keating saying in 1985? Implement a consumption tax because it will catch the tax cheats. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That provides a useful "net dividend" for distribution to the rest of the community.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what we are all about&mdash;redistributing the tax to the benefit of those most in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I further quote Mr Keating as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For too long the politically unpalatable decisions have been put off in this country because our politicians have not had the strength of purpose to tackle the hard issues.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating was saying then that our politicians had not had the strength of purpose, and yet he condemns Dr Hewson for having that strength of purpose. Of all things, after accusing Dr Hewson of being rigid in wanting to stick to the program, he then tries to justify his statement of last week by saying that members of the coalition are going around secretly saying to Australian voters, `Don't worry, because it won't get through the Senate'. We want to be elected to government in this country because we want to implement Fightback in full. It will give this country a chance again; it will give hope to Australians; and it includes the restructuring of the tax system in a more equitable and efficient way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was so easy for the now Prime Minister to endorse statements when he was not in the political opportunistic position he is at the moment. He went on to say in 1985:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The country has not been working to the peak of its achievable capacity because we, as a community, have not been prepared to let it do so.</PARA>
<PARA>That was his position as Treasurer of this country and has been as Prime Minister of this country. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'll be barracking for a broad-based consumption tax at a rate which assesses that income which has been avoided and evaded . . . The consumption tax has been designed with an awareness of the need to ensure that those who are needy and cannot benefit from income tax cuts will receive full, or more than full compensation.</PARA>
<PARA>What is Fightback all about? Pensioners, and all those who have a particular need, are fully&mdash;in fact, over-generously&mdash;compensated in Fightback, which is what Mr Keating said he was going to do back in 1985. We can still give benefit to families, for example, by doubling family allowances for lower income earners; in other words, try to develop the social benefits that are important in this country and that are in accordance with the values that we believe are important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go on with more quotes from Mr Keating. On 6 June in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> he was reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As far as the outcome is concerned, one has to do what one believes is right in the final analysis and I believe this is right&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is, to implement a consumption tax&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that's why I am doing it. If there are any kicks to the backside to take, I'll take them.</PARA>
<PARA>As soon as he saw a political opportunity in ditching it, he ditched it, and forgot the kicks in the backside. There is only one side of Australian politics which is prepared to stand up and take the political heat on this issue because it is in the best interests of the Australian people, and that is the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is amazing how many times Mr Keating reiterated his views back in 1985. In a speech in Melbourne he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We must all recognise that it would be all too easy in this debate to inflame fears and prejudice.</PARA>
<PARA>What is he doing now? He is going around the country inflaming fears and prejudice, and he should be condemned for doing so. Rather than wanting to debate the issue rationally and the merits of the tax that he supported in 1985, he is trying to run a scare campaign by inflaming fears and prejudice. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The emotive claim of the screaming headline will always be a strong temptation.</PARA>
<PARA>He has fallen for it this time. On 10 June 1985, in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>, justifying the tax on necessities, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think the public understands that they now have to buy all these necessities and they have to buy after they are slugged every week, and if we relieve their tax with large tax cuts they are better off.</PARA>
<PARA>What he is saying is that the broader the indirect tax base, the better; give consumers the capacity to pay for it through substantial tax cuts. That is exactly what we have done in Fightback. He ought to have the courage to endorse it in Australia's best interests because in 1985 he said it was in Australia's best interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an AAP interview on 13 June 1985, talking again about the oppressive high marginal rates of tax in Australia, he said that that was a reason to restructure the tax and have as broad a base as possible. He said that they were too high&mdash;they were very high, in fact. He said that if we could get down marginal rates it would be easier for people to pay for them out of relieved income. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The best way of making these taxes operate effectively and efficiently is with minimum exemptions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and Senator Kemp should listen to this; Mr Keating said&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and with a single rate; that is the lesson which comes from all over the world.</PARA>
<PARA>What has the Fightback! program done again? Exactly that. Minimum exemptions, get big tax cuts of marginal rates and we will be better off and start to have a taxation system competitive with those with whom we have to compete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> he says again how distorted the current wholesale sales tax is and how it has different rates, with some goods being taxed 20 per cent and some at 32 per cent. He says it is an unsatisfactory taxation system. He goes on in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS> on 16 June talking about those who are rorting the income tax system and how broadening the tax base through a goods and services tax or a consumption tax will help overcome that. He talks about the slack economic climate and how tax reform can provide more benefit through having a competitive taxation system. He says specifically that it is absolutely important that the necessities of life be included otherwise we will simply be reintroducing distortions back into the taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On those occasions the Prime Minister has totally endorsed the Fightback taxation program. Now he has flicked the switch of opportunism, abandoned the tax and said that it is vile. In rational debate he is putting down his case, repeating it time and time again, and now all of a sudden because it suits him politically it becomes vile. That is why Australians cannot believe a word that this Prime Minister says. We never hear what he really believes is economically in the best interests of the country as an election approaches. We then hear what is political opportunism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that practically every industrialised country in the world has implemented the reform that we seek to implement. Why have they done it? Because they recognise the need to get taxes off productivity. If we take them off productivity, we obviously have to provide revenue in some other form and consumption has all sorts of other benefits. It encourages saving and so forth. I suggest that Senator Button, who has an interest in these matters, look at the most recent IMF document that I have&mdash;I will give him the references if he likes&mdash;that talks about the value of this form of indirect tax both to the revenue because of its neutrality and, in particular, because of its efficiency. That is why we are seeking to implement it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For 10 years this Government has failed the Australian people. The situation in which we find this country now is one of misery. At least one million Australians are unemployed, we have terrible current account figures and a foreign debt that has quadrupled under Labor. It is a shocking legacy to leave our successors. That is the legacy of Labor. That is its record after 10 years of Government. That is what it is going to take to the Australian people. What do we do? We have the courage to put down a comprehensive program that gives Australia the chance to recover and gives young people the chance to get jobs in the future. It gives businesses the chance to expand and employ and, generally speaking, gives Australians hope. That is what Fightback is all about. It has been implemented by a leader who has the courage to stand up and support it, not in the way that the Prime Minister has. As soon as the heat is put on, opportunism drives him down another track. The Leader of the Opposition is someone who will take this program to the Australian people and implement it.

Since 1985 this Government has engaged in a whole range of taxation base broadening measures to which I want to refer the Senate. For example, we introduced the prescribed payments system to reduce the potential for fraud in the building industry and other subcontract industries. We introduced a capital gains tax&mdash;opposed by the Opposition&mdash;designed to underpin the integrity of the taxation system. We introduced a fringe benefits tax, opposed at the time by the Opposition. We introduced overseas tax haven legislation, opposed at the time by the Opposition. We introduced a tax file number, opposed at the time by the Opposition. We introduced an assets test to more fairly administer the pension system, opposed at the time by the Opposition, except Mr John Elliott, the President of the Liberal Party at the time, who was concerned with bigger numbers rather than those which involved pensioners and was able to see his way clear to support the base broadening of the tax. </PARA>

It involves higher taxes for everybody except those on $100,000 a year, the top income brackets. I will come to that in a moment. There is a pretence put in all of this that somehow it will be dealing with tax cheats. Mr Reith, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer, frequently refers to how the GST will deal with tax cheats. I remind Mr Reith and all Opposition senators here that the countries with the smallest black economy in the world per capita are the United States of America and Switzerland. Neither of those countries has a goods and services tax of this kind.

Exactly those sorts of issues which are of predominant concern in the United States, to which one would add health. The United States will be about building a Medicare system of the kind we have in Australia at the same time as the Opposition is dismantling it.

Over the weekend I was looking at a book by Sir Ian Gilmour, a former Minister in the Thatcher Government, who said that the only element of continuity in Thatcher Government economic policy was persistent self-congratulation. That was written by one of Mrs Thatcher's former Ministers in that Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is plenty of self-congratulation by those in the Opposition in finding they have courage. Even if they have courage, the question is whether it is directed in the right way.

It has nothing to do with making this economy operate better in the ways which are vitally important to the Australian people and which I have already mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is an inequitable tax. Let me deal with the question of equity. The Opposition claims that personal income tax cuts will be made. Those tax cuts do not compensate people with incomes under $40,000 for bracket creep and the price effects of the GST. The Treasury analysis of the distributional impact of the GST and the associated changes is that 70 per cent of households of full time wage and salary earners and about 60 per cent of self-employed people will be worse off under a GST. However, the Treasury analysis&mdash;and, indeed, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>&mdash;shows that very high income households are made better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at table 6.3 on page 43 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> we see that a person on $7,000 a year will receive $6.10 a week in tax benefits. A person on $100,000 a year will receive $159 a week. A person on a medium income of $25,000 to $30,000 will receive $22 up to $30 a week. If one's salary goes up to $80,000, one gets $140 a week in tax benefits in the tax package offered by the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax benefits all go to the very wealthy. To pretend that there is equity in all of that is very hard to deal with when one looks at the tables in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>. The Treasury analysis shows that very high income households are better off&mdash;and too right they are. Not only will they get huge personal tax benefits of the sort I have read out; a goods and services tax on clothing and footwear and food does not bear nearly as much on high income earners as it does on low income earners. Low income earners spend more of their budgets on food, clothing and things of that sort than do higher income earners. So the poor and middle classes are made worse off. A household with children and one full time wage earner with an income of up to $57,000 a year would be $400 a year worse off. Similar situations apply with self-employed and farm households with incomes of up to $61,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the impact of this proposed goods and services tax on business we see the same message. The switch from personal tax to a GST raises the compliance costs of the whole tax system. Costs paid by government and taxpayers in administration of the GST are higher per dollar of tax paid than for income taxes. A New Zealand study shows that compliance costs were much higher there, but the Opposition's GST will impose a massive burden particularly on small business. The GST will reduce the competitiveness of small business relative to larger business. This is a point which some Opposition senators have made here in the past. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The big problem is GST. This requires approximately one full day per two monthly return.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a country with a unicameral, unified system of government. There are not six States in New Zealand which administer separate taxes, separate laws and have special burdens imposed by the structure of Australian government on small businesses in New Zealand. Those things do not exist there. They do not exist in many of the other countries that have goods and services tax of some sort. Of course, they exist to some degree in the United States, which has no goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study in New Zealand showed that the compliance costs for the smallest firms were $26 per $1,000 of tax while for the biggest firms the corresponding figure was 5.4 per cent. Again, the GST is imposing burdens on small firms, imposing burdens on lowly paid people, rewarding the rich and rewarding the larger firms. That is particularly true in respect of the payroll tax set-off to which I referred a minute or two ago.  The GST is more expensive to collect than PAYE tax and, therefore, it is an inefficient tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this motion, Senator Hill devoted his time to talking about what Mr Keating said in a totally different environment in 1985 when there was no capital gains tax, no fringe benefits tax, when the corporate tax rate was much higher and when the top marginal rates were much higher for personal tax. Senator Hill spent all his time addressing that sort of irrelevant stuff. But I am concentrating on this motion, and the fact is that, if we look at the claims relating to family allowances being doubled, families will be made worse off by the GST. The Opposition does not compensate families for the taxes that it will impose on them. The Opposition, for example, will impose a tax on child-care. A conservative estimate is an extra $300 a year for each child. </PARA>

An analysis of that scarcely bears examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Treasury analysis shows that the Opposition has overestimated the effects of the GST on the black economy. In fact, Treasury says that the Opposition has a $1.9 billion hole in its package because it fails to account for the avoidance of GST and it wrongly assumes that the black economy will be caught by the GST. So much for the bumblings of the shadow Treasurer around the country when talking about the black economy and all of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GST package has a total $6 billion hole in its financing. Revenue has been overestimated by $3.6 billion and expenditure savings have been overestimated by $2.6 billion. The overall $6 billion hole means that one would have to raise the GST, or abandon the promised tax cuts, as the Opposition did in 1977 when its previous Government went to the people of Australia promising tax cuts and never delivering them&mdash;fistfuls of dollars. Those opposite would have to abandon the promised tax cuts, reduce government services or drop the already hopelessly inadequate compensation packages.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us be quite clear about what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) did in the House of Representatives last week. What he has done, as was further amplified by Senator Button a few moments ago, is to identify this absolutely horrible tax on food, clothing, perambulators, baby clothing, baby food and a number of other things which Senator Button has just identified&mdash;this GST on these necessities of life&mdash;as one of the worst things that could befall the Australian economy and one of the most disastrous things for the life and welfare of ordinary Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But then Mr Keating petulantly said, `If you don't vote for me at the next election, even though I have the power after the election to block this iniquitous tax, I will simply not lift a finger to attempt to assist the Australian people and the Australian economy. I will simply stand aside and let this terrible tax be imposed on my fellow Australians'. That is what Mr Keating has done. In my view, anyone who will act in such a fit of pique to further his or her own power ambitions&mdash;and let us make no bones about it, that is what is involved here&mdash;does not deserve to be a representative of the people of Australia, much less the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two words stand out in my mind quite clearly as identifying the coming program for the next election&mdash;integrity and compassion. One thing I will certainly give to the Opposition is that at least throughout this lead-up to the election it has behaved with integrity. It has announced its Fightback package and stuck by its guns. However, I do not believe that it has acted with compassion because, as Senator Button said a moment ago, the GST and other parts of the package will impose difficulty upon the Australian public. I do not believe that the Government, particularly the Government as led by Mr Keating, has acted with either integrity or compassion because, having identified this terrible tax, the Government has said that in opposition it would support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now very clear that Mr Keating's interest is not in issues which vitally affect the Australian people. His interest is merely in using the Australian public as a pawn on the chessboard of Australian politics to advance his own personal ambition. Mr Keating says that he will support the GST in the Senate if Dr Hewson wins the next election because Dr Hewson would have, as he says, a mandate. We have tried to identify through questioning exactly how far that mandate extends, but so far without success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This logic should also be applied to the rest of the Fightback package. The Opposition has clearly stated where it intends to take this package after the election, should it win government. The present Government's support for the GST portion of Fightback should also, by logic, be extended to the Opposition's industrial relations policy and to its attack on workers and unions, the health and social welfare system and this country's education system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating appears to reserve the right to vote against these other issues in the Senate. As Senator Hill said a few moments ago, this clearly identifies that Mr Keating still secretly supports the GST and is not only doublecrossing the Australian public in this double switch but the Australian Labor Party. I invite members of the Labor Party&mdash;not many are present&mdash;to take membership forms for the Liberal Party of Australia and join the Liberal Party, because I believe that that is where they should honestly reside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the weekend there have been several comments in newspapers about this switch by Mr Keating. I will mention two in particular. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> of New South Wales said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Coulter knows that Mr Keating's pledge will affect the Democrats' vote considerably. His complaints are self-serving and unjustifiable.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to lay that assertion to rest immediately. Our position in relation to the GST has been consistent all the way through. We are opposed to the GST for many of the fundamental reasons that have been identified by Senator Button today. Our position is that we will go into the election offering to oppose the GST after the election. The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Keating's pledge is a sign that at last Australia's politicians are treating voters with honesty . . .</PARA>
<PARA>We do not believe that it is treating voters with honesty to say that one will take a particular position before the election and offer it to the Australian voters and then simply reverse it after the election and vote against it. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if Dr Hewson wins the next election his reform program must be allowed to go through the Senate largely unchanged, for he will have a mandate from the people for his radical reforms.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> said similar things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is good policy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is the switch by Mr Keating&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">because, whatever Labor might think of the GST, it is plainly a platform article for the Coalition; if it won a majority at the next election, it would have an undoubted right to claim a popular mandate to put it into effect.</PARA>
<PARA>It may be that the editors of some of our newspapers are literate, but they are quite innumerate. It is a matter of record that, at the 1990 election, the Labor Party obtained 39.4 per cent of the vote in the House of Representatives. When, I ask those editors, is over 60 per cent of voters voting against a particular party not a majority? A majority of people in Australia voted against Labor at the last election. I believe that at the next election a majority of voters will vote against the coalition parties; they will not get over 50 per cent of the vote. Therefore, simply getting a majority of the seats in the House of Representatives does not constitute a mandate for Labor to carry out either some or all of its program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Constitution says quite clearly that the Parliament consists of two Houses, a House of Representatives and a Senate. With only a few exceptions, the powers of those two Houses are identical. All legislation must pass both Houses of the Parliament before it becomes law, and to try and argue that one House is more important than the other and that one House takes some sort of primacy simply does not find its origins in the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The powers of the Senate are set out in the Australian Constitution. Apart from differing powers with respect to money Bills&mdash;and I will come back to that term in a moment&mdash;the two Houses are equal in power. The differences in respect of money Bills are technical in nature and reflect the merging of two systems of  government,  the  Westminster system  and  the  US  federal  based senate system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Constitution limits the power of the Senate in two ways only: by prescribing that certain legislation must originate in the House of Representatives&mdash;which surely does not impact in any way on the power of the Senate to modify that legislation&mdash;and by limiting the power of the Senate to amend some forms of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two types of Bills which must originate in the House of Representatives are the Appropriation Bills and the Bills imposing taxation. With respect to taxation, I point to section 55 of the Constitution, in case there are some journalists listening, which says that taxation Bills cannot be linked to other pieces of legislation. It would be impossible to obscure the GST by linking it to some other piece of legislation. Section 55 says that that would make those other sections invalid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Appropriation and taxation Bills which must originate in the House of Representatives simply reflect the right of the Government to frame its Budget and impose new taxes. This does not in any sense limit the power of the Senate to modify those things. It simply refers to the piece of legislation which creates the liability, not the huge number of Bills that we deal with in every session which are collection and other machinery Bills. A very recent example was the abolition of sales tax on recycled paper products. This was a taxation measure which the coalition initially was minded to oppose, but in the end supported. Clearly, the Opposition recognised that it could modify, amend and change that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one further qualification on the powers of the Senate. The Senate may not amend any Bill to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. This provision under subsection 53(3) of the Constitution in effect reinforces the rule that laws imposing taxation should originate in the House of Representatives, but its scope has never been tested. However, although the Senate does not have the power to amend these limited categories of Bills, it specifically does have the right to reject them or to request the House of Representatives to amend them so that they can then be passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have pledged, and repeatedly pledged, that we would never interfere with Supply or Appropriation Bills. It is a pledge which has been honoured, and this Government, and indeed other governments from 1977 onwards, have been allowed to govern. Ever since we have held the balance of power or the balance of reason this has never been an issue as far as the Australian Democrats are concerned. The Opposition did make some noises about the postal allowance issue, but we dismissed its proposal because it may have led to a Constitutional crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate does have an important role in all proposals put forward by government, including taxation proposals and that is its role as a house of review. The Prime Minister is running the line that, since the Senate is not a States' House, it is not a house of review. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Senate is constantly reviewing hundreds of issues which traverse the whole gamut of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is true that some Opposition senators do abuse the mechanisms of the Senate to attack and defame members of the bureaucracy, from time to time the same can be said of the House of Representatives. For the Prime Minister to imply that the behaviour of some senators reflects glowingly on the House of Representatives is simply a non sequitur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus, under our bicameral system, the Senate is here as a check and balance against executive government. Mr Keating defines a mandate as winning a majority of seats in the House of Representatives but, as I have already said, the Labor Party obtained less than 40 per cent of the vote at the last election yet won more than half the seats. That is not a mandate. In any event, even if it were, that mandate was for a Hawke-led government and not a Keating-led government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that Labor is conceding that the future Hewson government will be allowed all its money Bills with respect to Supply and Appropriations. The Democrats agree with this proposition, but we do not accept that with respect to all fiscal measures. Indeed, Senator Schacht and others were on radio this week claiming that this principle of not interfering with Budget measures is a longstanding Labor principle. That is absolute rubbish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last period that Labor was in opposition, it successfully combined with the Democrats to defeat Mr Howard's proposed sales tax on the necessities of life. The issue of the right of the Senate to request such an amendment to the Government's tax proposals was debated in the House of Representatives in 1981 and both Mr Keating and Mr Dawkins voted expressly for the Senate's right to improve the legislation. The present exercise is simply an exercise in vote buying at the forthcoming election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Opposition has frequently opposed Budget legislation, mostly taxation matters, during the Hawke-Keating years. Examples are the capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax and superannuation. This so-called principle has been ditched by both sides whenever it suits them, and by both sides quite frequently. It is simply an argument of convenience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently we have seen the superannuation guarantee levy, taxation legislation and privatisation legislation, all of which have been enunciated with respect to the Opposition. Is Labor going to fall in behind the Opposition should it form government and acquiesce with all these measures? Dr Hewson has also said that the Franklin Dam in Tasmania may well be built under a federal Liberal government. Will the Labor Party also support that? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Thursday the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made a quite extraordinary statement in the House of Representatives in response to a question asked of him. The goods and services tax that the coalition is proposing after the next election will enable it to fund a 30 per cent cut in income tax. It will double family allowances for lower income families who have been so battered by the policies of this Government over the past 10 years; and it will completely abolish some of those major taxes on the cost of doing business in Australia, that is, those taxes which make us high cost, less productive and less competitive than we otherwise would be, could be and should be. I refer to the wholesale sales tax, payroll tax&mdash;which is simply a tax on jobs&mdash;and the tax on fuel which is no less than 26c a litre nowadays.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fuel excise has increased from the figure of 6c a litre that applied when this Government came in almost 10 years ago. It is an absolute rip-off and an enormous cost burden on business, private consumers and motorists alike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister said that even though a tax of the nature we are proposing, the goods and services tax, does all of those things&mdash;even though it gets at some of the tax cheats in our economy and even though it is a much fairer system of tax&mdash;it was a quite inequitable, vile and vicious tax. He went on to say in the very next breath that although it is such a terrible tax, if the Labor Government is defeated and is therefore in opposition after the next election, the Labor Party Opposition would not obstruct the passage of the goods and services tax legislation in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the Senate that the Prime Minister cannot have it both ways. If the goods and services tax is the dreadful tax he claims it to be, he must oppose it because one cannot describe a tax of the nature of the goods and services tax in the way the Prime Minister has and then say with any credibility that he will not oppose it in the Senate. One must have it one way or another; one cannot have it both ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the fatal mistake the Prime Minister made last week was that he gave the electorate a very confused message indeed. The bottom line of the message though is that Labor wants a GST just as much as the coalition wants a GST. I will give some examples in a moment of why the Prime Minister has always believed that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say a couple of other things by way of response to the quite misleading, and in several aspects totally wrong, comments Senator Button made earlier in this debate. I preface them by pointing out that Australia is one of the very few countries in the whole world that does not have a tax of the nature of the goods and services tax that the coalition is proposing. We are, I think, the only OECD country that does not have such a tax or one very similar to it and most of the fastest growing nations on earth are now adopting such a tax. Most of the South East Asian giants have such a tax and they are leading the world in economic growth. Most countries in the industrialised world have had such a tax for almost 30 years. Some of them have had it for more than 30 years. Anyone from those countries coming to Australia and listening to the debate that is going on in this country about a GST must find it quite amazing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, if the Prime Minister were prepared to be honest about this and stick with the comments he so rightly made in 1985 when he was Treasurer and when he attempted to have such a consumption tax or broadly-based consumption tax implemented only to be rolled by the trade union movement&mdash;by Bill Kelty, Simon Crean and then his own Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, pulling the pin on him and cutting off his plans and indeed the Government's plans&mdash;we would now have a goods and services tax of the type the coalition is proposing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1985, the then Treasurer said some very sensible things firstly about the need for tax reform in Australia and secondly about the nature of the desirable tax reform. In May 1985 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tax reform cannot be regarded as optional for Australia. Despite its difficulties, the cost of not beginning a substantial reform program are now unacceptably high.</PARA>
<PARA>Less than a month later he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we don't as a nation adopt this proposal&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the proposal for a broadly based consumption tax or, in today's language, a GST&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">then you won't see significant reform in this country in taxation for the balance of this century.</PARA>
<PARA>He would have been right had we not had a coalition now with the courage to get up and take the ball from where the then Treasurer Keating dropped it in 1985 because the trade union movement and his own Prime Minister deserted him. Again in June 1985 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this sort of proposal doesn't get up&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is the GST proposal&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">one has to decide if there's much point in someone like me worrying about the Australian institutional process, and in Australian institutions, very much longer.</PARA>
<PARA>So Prime Minister Keating, then Treasurer Keating, was a very articulate and correct exponent of the need for major tax reform in this country in 1985. The basis for his reform proposals was the introduction of a broadly-based goods and services tax, or consumption tax. He spelt out very clearly in an address to the National Press Club on 5 June 1985 what the main advantages of such a tax were. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, it will allow a more rational indirect tax system than the current anomaly-ridden wholesale tax, which has multiple rates, numerous exemptions, and fails to tax the services sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, it will enable us to generate tax revenues to provide for a major reduction in the marginal rates of income tax. No other tax has the same potential for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, it generates tax from those who will continue to evade or avoid income tax. That provides a useful `net dividend' for distribution to the rest of the community.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he was saying quite rightly that a goods and services tax gets at the tax cheats in the community. It does not eliminate&mdash;no-one has ever suggested it eliminates&mdash;the black economy, but it does get at those tax cheats who are not paying their fair share of tax because they will be taxed when they spend. The Prime Minister also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . The virtually zero exemption, single rate structure of the tax&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is of course very similar to ours now&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is a crucial design feature. It will assist both administration and compliance.</PARA>
<PARA>That is why Senator Button was so totally wrong today when he claimed that small business was going to be disadvantaged by a huge amount of administrative cost and administrative compliance burden with the goods and services tax that the coalition will be introducing on 1 October 1994 in government. It is a very simple, equitable, efficient tax which is very inexpensive to comply with and to administer. The amount of paperwork involved with it for business people is minuscule compared with the amount of very complex, time-consuming and costly paperwork involved for all those businesses that nowadays are involved in the monstrously complex area of the wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The wholesale sales tax will be totally abolished by a coalition government because the goods and services tax will enable it to be so abolished. Similarly, this will occur with payroll tax. Payroll tax nowadays rips off something like $6 billion from employers. That is a tax on jobs. At a time when we have one million people officially unemployed in this country and another million who are either underemployed or whose unemployment is hidden from the statistics because they have simply dropped out of the potential work force, because they have lost all hope of ever getting a job, it is just lunacy to continue with a tax in the nature of payroll tax which is a straight tax on jobs. The goods and services tax will enable that tax to be abolished. As I mentioned earlier, the goods and services tax also will enable there to be a total abolition of the tax on petrol in this country&mdash;a tax which is now 26c a litre, which is an enormous cost burden not just on business but also on private motorists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bearing in mind that the goods and services tax is only one element of our tax reform and that tax reform, whilst being an essential part of the reform, is only one part of the much wider Fightback package, Senator Button asserted that the Fightback package was designed amongst other things to dismantle Medicare. That is an absolute untruth; that is not true. The Fightback package, very importantly, retains Medicare and improves the health system in many very important ways. Senator Button also said that there would be no bracket creep or price effect compensation in the Fightback package. That too is simply an untruth, and my leader Senator Hill reflected on and answered that in his comments. Senator Button said that the GST would not touch the black economy. That also is simply not correct, and Paul Keating himself was a very substantial and articulate exponent on the reasons why it would tackle the black economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Family allowances will be doubled under the coalition's policy. People on lower incomes, particularly single income families with young children, have been absolutely slaughtered by the tax system and the economy in the last 10 years under Labor. We will double family allowances to help meet the costs and disadvantages that they have suffered. That, again, can be financed only through the introduction of a goods and services tax. Senator Button said that we were going to do dreadful things to child-care. I do not know whether he has read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>, but in fact we are going to spend an extra $90m on child-care.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a debate about the goods and services tax. It is clear from the debate so far that there is a very clear distinction between the position of the coalition and that of the Government. The clear distinction to be drawn from the debate is that the Government, the Australian Labor Party, opposes a goods and services tax and does so most implacably; the coalition embraces it and does so enthusiastically. What the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said is this: taking note of the way the Constitution has been written, particularly section 53, if after being fully informed through proper debate the Australian people come to the conclusion that the GST package put forward by the Opposition is the one they want and they vote for it, this Party, if it is in opposition, will not oppose it in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that by no means can be taken to mean that the people on this side of the chamber in any way endorse a goods and services tax. It is quite clear from the whole course of debate over many months now, from Question Time, from public statements outside, that this Government, this Party, is absolutely opposed to the goods and services tax. What the Opposition says is, `Well, look, the person who is now Prime Minister of this country supported a goods and service tax in 1985'. But, of course, a lot of history has passed since then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">President Reagan was in power in 1985; Prime Minister Thatcher was in power in 1985. They pursued an economic course that the Opposition proposes to pursue&mdash;and I ask honourable senators to look at where their countries are now. In both countries there is dissent and division, and there are disputes within their respective communities. However, in Australia&mdash;while I concede that that it has high unemployment and economic hardship and that the country could be better off, and I take all that into account&mdash;the fabric of our society, the ability of our people to get on together, is much better than it is in either of those two countries of which I have spoken. It is the division in those countries, the awful riots that we have seen, for example, in Los Angeles, that must be avoided at all costs&mdash;and the program that will be able to achieve that is one of conciliation. That is not the sort of program that is put by honourable senators opposite. The Government has shown over the last few years through its policies, particularly its industrial relations policy, that it is capable of keeping the community together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What sorts of policies would the coalition pursue if it got into government? As has been made clear by those opposite, the goods and services tax does not stand on its own. As you well know, Mr Acting Deputy President, given the great service you have given in the union movement in the past, the goods and services tax as proposed by the Opposition requires awful changes&mdash;and I use that word advisedly&mdash;to the industrial laws of this country. Why do I say `awful'; what sorts of changes would we get? We would get the sorts of changes that the Victorian Government has introduced in Melbourne which have denied people their vested rights&mdash;rights that they had&mdash;to claim for compensation. The Victorian Government has retrospectively taken those rights away and has introduced industrial laws that tomorrow will have many, many people in the streets of Melbourne. That sort of thing has not happened for a long, long while. If the cost of this goods and services tax as proposed by the coalition is to get back to the awful periods of industrial chaos that we used to have in the late 1970s and early 1980s before the advent of this Government, then it ought to be avoided at all costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just go through what this urgency motion says would happen under a goods and services tax. First of all, it says that personal income tax would be reduced by 30 per cent. Nobody would oppose a reduction of tax if it were to be made responsibly. In other words, if we as a community could reduce our taxes without throwing onto the community generally all sorts of pressures that lead to injustice, disputes and dissent, we ought to do it. But we should not reduce taxes, or introduce other taxes, if it would cause those things to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The urgency motion also says that the introduction of a GST will enable wholesale sales tax, payroll tax and the tax on fuel to be abolished. Mr Acting Deputy President, payroll tax is a State tax and, as such, this Parliament does not have the power to abolish such a tax. If the State governments are persuaded to take away payroll tax, they will have to introduce a tax of their own to compensate. The sort of tax that they would have to introduce could well be a tax of the type that has been introduced by the coalition Government in Victoria. That tax is, in effect&mdash;and I am sure that Senator Watson does not like this sort of tax&mdash;a poll tax. To compensate for a lack of money, the Victorian Government has imposed $100 on each household&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am saying, Senator Knowles, is this: if wholesale taxes, payroll taxes and taxes on fuel are abolished, State governments will have to look for other avenues of revenue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators opposite are saying that there is a tax on bread that is sold in shops. I just simply say that that is not so. This is why we have to be a bit careful. We are talking now about the goods and services tax and the abolition of the wholesale tax. We are talking about a tax on a commodity. The Opposition is saying that at this point of time there is a goods and services-type tax, or a wholesale tax, on bread, milk and butter. I simply say that there is not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The urgency motion also states that the introduction of a GST will enable family allowances to be doubled for lower income families. Who could dispute that it was not a good thing to double family allowances? Of course, they will have to be doubled because people will have to be compensated. I say&mdash;and honourable senators opposite disagree with me on this&mdash;that bread, milk and butter will be made more expensive because of the goods and services tax. The Opposition, as I understand its argument, says that they will not be made more expensive. It is extraordinary to say that. What is the point of applying a goods and services tax if, as is inferred by honourable senators opposite, such a tax is already in place? I think my proposition about taxes on all of these basic commodities is probably correct and Opposition senators are wrong. That is why a coalition government would have to increase allowances for lower income families. Those families would have to pay more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Would it not be better to allow people to keep their money so that they can buy the essentials of life at a cheaper price? Would it not be better to allow them to have control over their own destinies rather than, as a government, taking money from them and then giving it back to them? That is paternalism at its worst and this is another problem that we find with the goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To lower costs and to make this scheme work the people opposite will have to suppress wages. To do that they will have to take away the right to strike. They will have to take away the means by which workers can engage in industrial action. The fault and the vice of such an action is well illustrated in a statement by Archbishop Little&mdash;a man who has not entered the political arena on this or any other occasion. This morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne, Sir Frank Little, has waded into the political debate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is over stretching it because he is not a man who does that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">with a strong defence of the role of unions and the right of workers to take industrial action.</PARA>
<PARA>That has been said in the light of events that are going on in Australia at the moment. The real problem with the program that has been put forward by those opposite, the real problem with the goods and services tax, is that it strikes at the very foundation of what society should be all about. In society there certainly should be differences between people. People who go into different endeavours and work hard should be rewarded for what they do. But we should not allow society to become so uneven that terrible injustices and degradation of certain sections occur. No doubt it was with that in the back of his mind that Archbishop Little said that people who are wrongly used ought to have the ability to protest and, if needs be, to protest in a collective way. We can see by the way in which laws have been undeniably rushed into the legislature in Victoria that workers are going to be strongly denied the ability to do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give an illustration of what would happen. A person in Victoria whose leg is cut off beneath the knee will get workers compensation for up to two years but no more compensation than that. One will not be able to sue for damages, no matter how negligent one's employer has been at work. If a worker sustains a back injury at work, he will be required to have an operation within two years and two weeks of the accident occurring. Even though his injury may be caused through his employer's negligence at work, he will have to pay for the operation and for the six months that he is off work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program that has been put to us by the Opposition can be made to work by bearing down upon those least able to sustain a loss.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard from the likeable and knowledgable Senator Barney Cooney, who we all know is not only a deeply religious man but also a man not given to superstition. Indeed, he is a most enlightened senator. Might I remind him that when he was making some of his dire predictions this afternoon, some of the lights surprisingly went off in the Senate chamber. Interestingly enough, some of them are now starting to come on. I leave it to the Senate to interpret the significance of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Prime Minister Keating announced to a shocked House of Representatives that an ALP in opposition would not oppose the passing of the GST in the Senate, he was merely repositioning the ALP in line with the ALP manifesto of 1975. Is that right, Senator Cooney? It is 100 per cent right. While some Labor senators were outraged and went so far as to indicate that it may not be Mr Keating's decision in 1993, others said it was merely an acknowledgment of Keating's 1985 support for a GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this rage of Gough Whitlam and the ALP is to have any continuing substance, a Liberal-National Party coalition government in 1993-94 would not be denied Supply and would not be denied a major source of revenue from a GST&mdash;the GST proposed in the Fightback package&mdash;that would form such a major part of its election platform and would be central to the new government's mandate from the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Governments are formed by majorities in the House of Representatives, and revenue raising measures which are appropriately announced prior to an election or, indeed, within the context of an annual Budget should be acknowledged by the Senate. There is no doubt about that. We honour it on our side, and we know that the Labor Party will honour it too. So the question is: why has the Keating Government hung on to such an anachronistic tax, such as the wholesale sales tax, and a host of others, which the Liberal-National Party coalition will abolish?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When introduced in the 1930s, wholesale trading was prevalent in most industries, but nowadays wholesale trading is disappearing. I put it to the Senate that this wholesale sales tax regime, particularly with its broadening base and escalating rates under this Government, is encouraging the demise of the wholesale traders. That is a tragedy. This tax is driving people out of business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it such a problem? The rates today are very much higher than they were in the 1930s. The base is very much wider, and widening every day&mdash;$3.5 billion raised when Labor came into government, but almost $10 billion revenue raised today. It is a hidden tax, a cascading tax and a tax that, in most cases, has to be paid before the debt is collected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give the Senate an example of how this iniquitous tax is driving a lot of wholesale traders out of business. Let us say, for example, that Senator Cooney and Senator Loosley are electricians. Senator Cooney goes to K-Mart to buy his fittings and cables to do a job. Senator Loosley goes to a wholesale merchant. The price that Senator Cooney has to pay for his goods includes the wholesale sales tax, which is based not only on the wholesale price but on his margin. Senator Cooney goes along to K-Mart, and K-Mart has paid its tax because it buys directly from the manufacturer at a very much lower quantum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Technically, Coles-K-Mart cannot distinguish the people who go through the checkout aisles, whether Senator Cooney is an electrician or I am a final consumer. We all know that sales tax is paid on the final price before the retail price. So this very process arithmetically is driving small wholesalers out of business. No wonder they are suffering. No wonder all those associated with sales tax have problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us see how this will impact on another industry. Mr Ken Traill, who is the group tax counsel for Coca-Cola, states in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Accountant</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that Fightback! is "absolutely" more positive business than Keating's "One Nation" and Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) proposals to start on April 1, 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>He said of Mr Keating's One Nation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed FBT changes spell an increase in cost . . . Our FBT liability will nearly double.</PARA>
<PARA>But the important thing Traill states about wholesale sales tax is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are four issues associated with the wholesale sales tax&mdash;1) the deferral techniques;  2) whether an item is taxable or exempt; 3) the rate of tax; and 4) basic compliance cost.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Traill plays down the fear that GST would generally raise retail prices. The 20 per cent WST on beverages and snack foods equates to 15 per cent of the retail price . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is something that the Labor Party will not appreciate. Then there is also the GST on the packaging. Traill goes on to say that under Fightback:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fuel prices will come down, excise and levies will fall, payroll tax will be abolished . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We remember that almost two-thirds of people in New Zealand were against a GST before it was introduced. Within a month of introduction that percentage had turned around and two-thirds were in favour of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Labor Party talks about the need for tax simplification. We will introduce tax simplification on both direct and indirect taxation. Mr McKenna, the Chief Executive Officer of the Certified Practising Accountants in Australia, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . 88 per cent of CPAs spend valuable time satisfying compliance demands . . . nearly a quarter of CPAs spend more than half their time on compliance work.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition will simplify not only wholesale sales tax by replacing it with a GST but also income tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the overriding purpose of the Fightback program of reform is to provide a generational change in policies and attitudes. Our aim is to give individual Australians greater control over their own lives by creating more incentives and opportunities for all Australians to work harder and to be rewarded for it, and thus to be able to save and invest. But these objectives can only be achieved if a national government, such as a Liberal-National Party government, sees its proper role as providing a framework of policy and equal laws within which individuals, families and businesses are allowed to fulfil their potential and to plan with certainty and confidence. We believe that such a program is the essential feature of the Fightback proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will abolish the $9.4 billion wholesale sales tax and the $5.9 billion payroll tax. Fancy in these recessionary times having a tax on employment! And that is what payroll tax is. We will abolish the $6.6 billion excise on petroleum products&mdash;about 55 per cent of which falls on business. Prices for private fuel will drop by 19c a litre. The coalition will abolish the $3.3 billion of customs duties; we will abolish the training guarantee levy; we will limit the superannuation guarantee charge; and we will reduce the tax on exports by $1.7 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will be the result of all these changes to the economy? Costs in the agricultural sector will fall by $1 billion; in the transport economy by $2 billion; in the finance industry by $860m; in the manufacturing industry by $5.4 billion. There will be more jobs because the GST is not a cascading tax. Costs in the electricity industry will fall by $526m, and in the mining industry costs will fall by $677m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essential feature of the Fightback proposal is the family, because it is the essential building block of society. It provides the most effective means for the care and development of children. It is a source of security, stability and values, both personal and social. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the personal income tax proposals that will be associated with the Fightback package. Income tax savings of 30 per cent will return $13 billion to taxpayers. We will raise the tax-free threshold from $5,400 to $7,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will this mean? It will mean that 320,000 Australians will then pay no tax at all. It cuts the marginal tax rates and puts more money back into taxpayers' pockets. The coalition's tax policy will enable many Australians to double their income and still pay only 30c in the dollar. There will be an income tax saving of $1,585 for those on an income of $30,000. All those whose income falls in the range of $5,401 to $20,700 who currently pay tax at the rate of 20 per cent will continue to pay that rate of tax under the Keating Government, but under the coalition it will drop significantly to 16.2 per cent for the income range of $7,001 to $20,700. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that excluded from the goods and services tax are a number of important family expenses: the family home, education, school fees, health expenses including visits to the doctor, prescriptions, medical aids, wheelchairs, hearing aids, dentures, spectacles, hospital and nursing home services, local government rates, insurance, rent, financial services and transactions. Also exempt under the coalition's proposal  are financial services, gambling and lotteries, land, residential and commercial rates, building and construction services. A number of things are zero rated: health, education, government provisions, charities and religious institutions, exports, and taxable activities sold as going concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing is that the abolition of the petrol excise, as I mentioned earlier, will reduce the price of petrol by 19c a litre, a saving of approximately $11.40 every time senators and all others fill up their cars. Australia is a big continent. Long distance travel is associated with distance and size. We hear of the tyranny of distance. A lot of the costs that go into everyday consumable items bear a significant petrol cost. At the moment, these items bear a very significant tax component from the sales tax on trailer rigs, tyres and so on. We will scrap this ramshackle sales tax that adds up to 30 per cent to the price of hundreds of everyday items. This tax is hidden; it is not seen. No wonder Senator Cooney made such an oversight. He forgot it was hidden. If Senator Cooney cannot see that, the others are also mistaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will introduce a new tax-free savings scheme so the taxpayers will pay no tax on interest income, on new savings up to a limit of $2,000 a year for couples. We will abolish anti-business taxes&mdash;not just payroll tax, but also the training guarantee levy and so on. The coalition's policies under Fightback will enable Australian industry to recover from the recession. Family allowances will be doubled for families with a combined income below $30,000.

I am delighted to do so in these concluding remarks. It is instructive to analyse with some precision the terms of an urgency motion, because it is always of some fascination to try to determine the motivation and the driving forces behind the minds of the people who put these propositions together. It is therefore unusually instructive to look at the terminology that begins this urgency motion this afternoon. The motion reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Noting that a Federal election can be called at any time . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The fact that the Federal Opposition has been predicting, throughout 1992, that a general election will be called at any time says far more about the instability existing within its ranks than any observation about the current state of electoral play in Australia might suggest. The fact that an urgency motion would begin with those words underlines both the instability and the lack of confidence within the coalition as it approaches a general election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pleasure to follow Senator Watson in this debate. As with Senator Cooney, he is a likeable person; he is knowledgeable on matters of tax. But it was significant that he skated over the issue of constitutional impropriety in 1975, of the malice with which the coalition dealt with the Constitution in 1975, of the havoc wreaked upon the system of Australian Government in 1975. Senator Watson in no way conceded that the episode of 11 November 1975, the incidents that led up to it, and the course of action which followed 11 November 1975 still exist as a jagged scar across the cheek of Australian democracy. There is no question about that. I will come to that a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the matter of the coalition's lack of confidence and uncertainty concerning a general election&mdash;and Senator Bolkus as the Minister responsible would know this better than I&mdash;if one looks at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 26 September this year, in incident after incident, Dr Hewson, the Leader of the Opposition, is quoted as predicting elections almost from the beginning of the parliamentary term.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What makes it particularly germane in this debate is that, because of the impact of the goods and services tax, those opposite will squander the opportunity again. It is impossible to walk away from it now. Why has it become impossible? Because the Prime Minister made it crystal clear in the House of Representatives, just last week, in answer to a question, that in the unlikely and unpalatable event that a coalition forms government after the next poll, the Labor Party would not obstruct the imposition of a goods and services tax. To paraphrase the very generous remarks made by US President George Bush the other day, the majesty of the democratic process can be respected. The people on this side of the chamber have an infinitely better track record, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you know, than those opposite on matters of constitutional propriety and respect for the democratic process and respect and acknowledgment for the parliamentary system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now in a circumstance whereby the coalition actually goes into electoral free fall. There is no doubt at all, as the Prime Minister made clear in the House of Representatives just a few days ago, that certain coalition strategists were, with a nod and a wink, saying, `Well, it is safe to vote for Liberal and National parties, safe to vote for the coalition in general election because there is no real chance of a GST being passed by the Senate'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alternatively, it could be suggested that the Labor Party would allow itself to be placed in a circumstance whereby a double dissolution could be called for at the whim of a conservative prime minister. Neither of those eventualities will come about. We have taken the deliberate step of making it absolutely clear that a GST, as part of an electoral mandate, will come about if a coalition government were to be elected. I think that event is unlikely, but if it comes about, then the coalition goes into free fall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why the division on the GST? Why the division in electoral opinion? Why the division between the parties now? Why the division amongst the commentators on the impact of the GST?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that a variant of a goods and services tax was supported by the then Treasurer and sections of the Labor movement in 1985. It was a very different proposition from the one that we have now. Times have moved on; they have moved on in a dramatic sense electorally; they have moved on in terms of management of the economy; and they have moved on in terms of political perceptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened subsequent to the tax summit in 1985 when the goods and services tax was first canvassed? Five major steps within the tax system were taken by the Labor Government  to make the system better, fairer and more equitable. Five deliberate steps were taken. They were taken on a fringe benefits tax; by closing overseas tax havens, which made it much harder for companies and wealthy individuals either to avoid or evade tax; by making certain that an enhanced tax file number tightened income tax and made certain of collections from PAYE sources and went about attacking the black economy&mdash;the cash economy; by having a prescribed payments system; and, of course, by moving on the issue of capital gains tax which proceeded systematically to tax windfall profits. That is one explanation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second explanation of equal significance is that if one looks at the coalition's proposal for a GST, which lies at the core of the Fightback package, one will see that it is an absolute certainty that it will increase prices across the board on a range of goods and services; it will make absolutely certain that people on the lower end of the socio-economic scale pay comparatively more than those on the top end of the scale; and it will increase inflation. It will increase inflation at a time when the battle against inordinate increases in the cost of living has largely been won; when Australia has the best record on inflation in the OECD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the answer in terms of why the division now? The Government is implacably opposed to a GST; the Opposition has embraced it. Let the general election be fought on those parameters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Internationally, let us look at movements in opinions. Let us look at movements in terms of comparable Western democracies. In the United States, the Bush Administration has been rejected by the American people, overwhelmingly in the electoral college, convincingly in terms of popular vote. Governor Clinton&mdash;now President-elect Clinton&mdash;and his new Administration are coming to office on the basis of commitments to do more; to intervene to a greater extent than was apparent under 12 years of his Republican predecessors; to intervene more in terms of industrial policy; to intervene more in terms of economic management; to do more in terms of assisting those on the lower end of the socio-economic scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United Kingdom, in the wake of the fiasco of British Coal's decision to close more than 30 pits, the Government of Prime Minister Major is in very serious trouble. The inheritor of the Thatcherite tradition, which is embraced so enthusiastically by those opposite, is in deep electoral trouble and very serious parliamentary trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple point to make is that internationally the trend has moved against those who developed the Fightback proposals in 1990, announced them in 1991 and are now manacled to them as we go to a 1993 general election. International opinion has moved against the coalition decisively and demonstrably, and that will be a useful point to be made by the ALP at the time of the general election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the circumstance in which the coalition, in political terms and in terms of a policy framework, has gone into free fall. There is no restraint. The GST has actually moved to the very centre ground of the electoral debate as we move into the new year. That is not an argument which the coalition can win. That is not an argument which the coalition can sustain. That is why there are so many people opposite who are edgy on this issue. That is why, in terms of the public platform and the political debate, it is much easier for those in the Government to find weaknesses, flaws and failures in Fightback than it is possible for those opposite, as they now realise, to argue any perceived strengths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for what ought to happen in this chamber, if the coalition had taken the view that Senator Watson expressed quite reasonably towards the end of his remarks about a government being legitimised by majority status in the House of Representatives, and money Bills not being tampered with, frustrated or defeated in the Senate, then, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you are aware, and as everyone in this chamber is aware, the Whitlam Labor Government would have gone on to May 1977 and faced a general election at the time that was appropriate, rather than being forced to the polls for a second time in some 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We took that view in 1974 and in 1975, and we take it again now. The Senate is not a body that was designed by the constitutional forebears to frustrate, delay, harass or destroy governments made in the lower House. It is a pity that on money Bills, in particular, that view was not taken by those opposite in 1974 or in 1975. To quote the Prime Minister in the remarks he made on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we want the battle for the GST to be fought out in the House of Representatives. We are opposed to a GST, Dr Hewson is in favour of one.</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing could be clearer; it is crystal-clear in terms of the battle lines being drawn. I quote the Prime Minister again from the same program. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't believe that it is legitimate for an Opposition and in the Senate to deny the principle element of what is a clearly articulated mandate. I notice George Bush yesterday talked about the `majesty of democracy' in his very eloquent speech where he accepted defeat and said he would cooperate in handing over the mantle to President-elect Clinton. That sort of respect for the democratic process is something my party has always had. We are not the constitutional wreckers of this federation&mdash;that we have left to the Liberal Party. They are the people who hold up supply, have Governor Generals appoint Opposition Leaders as Prime Ministers, all that sort of nonsense and risk is taken by them.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an eloquent summation of the constitutional history of this country. The battle lines are drawn. We welcome the battle. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;From listening to Labor senators today, it is clear that the major parties&mdash;the alternative governments&mdash;in this country are poles apart. There is no doubt about that at all. Labor is standing on its record. It is going to the people in this forthcoming election with the economic model that it has had for the last 10 years and which has failed. It is a model which has resulted in one million Australians being out of work and the disastrous situation in which we find this country. It is appalling for a country with so much potential, so much in the way of natural resources and such great opportunity to be brought to its knees by an incompetent government and an incompetent economic management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the Government offers nothing new and no reform of its program. That is what it is taking to the Australian people. We have put down an alternative. It is an alternative that can put incentive back into the economy and give businesses the chance to thrive, grow and employ again. We will do it by taking $6 billion off the total tax bill and by restructuring within the taxation system. That restructuring, like all other industrialised countries in the world, includes a goods and services tax or a form of consumption tax in order to get taxes off production. This Government is not prepared to face up to that necessity as other industrialised countries have done. The result is that it makes our businesses less competitive and therefore they are unable to grow and employ in the way we want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion is in such a form that it endorses the benefits of the package. It states at least some of the benefits that would come out of that tax restructuring, including the personal income tax cuts of 30 per cent, getting rid of the wholesale sales tax, the payroll tax&mdash;a tax on jobs&mdash;and the fuel tax, which is also a tax on jobs. We mentioned that we will double family allowances for those who are less well off in this community and that tax cheats will at least have to pay some tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have set out the benefits of the program&mdash;the restructuring of the taxation system&mdash;and we have said to the Labor Party, `Come in and in these terms endorse the Prime Minister's statement that it will support our reform package from opposition'. This Government is now about to be put to the test. Will it vote in support of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in support of this motion that we have moved today and in support of the reforms and the benefits of the reforms, or will it wimp it, try to amend the motion, as apparently Senator Button wants, and then vote with the Australian Democrats again? It will further confuse the picture and end up in a muddle again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Senator Button really said is that the Government will endorse the Prime Minister on principle but it will not endorse him on the package. It cannot have it both ways. If it is going to vote for the Fightback package in this chamber, as the Prime Minister was saying, then it will vote for the benefits of the Fightback package&mdash;that is, such things as income tax being reduced by 30 per cent. Let us see what the Government does today. Let us see whether it has the courage to stand up to the Prime Minister with all the ramifications of what he has said. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>In speaking to this motion, I wish to congratulate the Australian Dairy Corporation on its annual report and the work that it does to improve the profitable structure market of Australian dairy produce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some interesting developments in the dairy industry in the past 12 months, the period covered by this report. As the Chairman notes in his foreword, the results for the year were better than expected, reflecting improved trading conditions. He notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry's performance is closely linked to the international market and in the latter half of 1991/1992 international prices rose significantly, which has caused a renewal of confidence in future prospects, although with a degree of uncertainty engendered by the US Presidential elections, the delayed resolution of the Uruguay Round, and political uncertainties in Eastern Europe.</PARA>
<PARA>He also notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recently announced market support arrangements which followed the Industry Commission report and extensive government/industry consultations, have played an important part in contributing to industry confidence.</PARA>
<PARA>The culmination of those developments in the industry was the dairy produce amendment and levy Bills which we debated in this chamber in June this year. That legislation represented tremendous change for the dairy industry. This industry has been determined to restructure, to become more efficient and be able to compete on world markets. This has been very noticeable, because at one stage the dairy industry was really in the doldrums. All the people in the dairy industry wanted to get out of it and get into beef cattle. It is now nearly a complete turnaround, so much so that the dairy industry is one of the really good industries for rural people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry has had no choice but to become more efficient because, if it had not rationalised and restructured, it would not have been able to compete in the way it was required to. In those Bills, the Government basically followed the recommendations of the Industry Commission report, with a number of exceptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main arguments in that report was that Australian consumers would get cheaper milk if controls in the Australian dairy industry were removed. It is said that `further reductions in assistance must take place if the dairy industry is to maximise its contribution to national welfare', adding that the Australian industry had to prepare for increased competition from New Zealand dairy products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the report recommended that assistance to the industry should be phased out in the next two to 10 years and that the Commonwealth should phase down maximum market support payments from 20 per cent of average export prices to 5 per cent by 1996. Instead, the Government recommended a 12 month delay or holding at the present 20 per cent level, down to 10 per cent by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, if the Government had accepted the Industry Commission's report in its totality, I ask honourable senators whether they honestly believe that the whole community would have benefited if, in the long run, its proposed changes resulted in decreased production, a significant reduction in jobs and the industry unable to compete on world markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So often now the Industry Commission seems to believe that it is acceptable for Australia to become a dumping ground. It is asking Australian farmers and manufacturers to accept, as right and proper, prices which are based on the world market's dumped prices. We have seen this asked of producers in other rural industries. These prices are the result of political decisions in Brussels and Washington. They do not reflect retail prices in the exporting countries where consumers are paying more for their produce than Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian dairy industry is alive with innovation, technical progress and a driving will to compete. Our dairy foods are as good as, and in many cases better than, any in the world. Dairy food exports earn more than $700m each year. The industry's major investments in research, technology and market development will see these export earnings grow. Dairy farmer productivity is increasing by 5 per cent per year, as it has for the past decade. The industry's willingness to adapt to change means that it will benefit from even minor reforms in the international trading environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians already buy premier quality dairy foods at prices as low as anywhere in the world. Australian dairy farmers produce milk at a lower cost than those in Europe, the USA, Canada or Japan, thanks to our pasture-based farming. In fact, few countries can produce quality dairy products as cheaply as Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is good to know that more than 100,000 Australians have jobs thanks to the dairy industry. The industry provides about 20 per cent of employment in a number of important dairying regions. This is particularly important in light of the difficult times that rural Australia is now experiencing. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IE4">Senator ARCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In order to fully appreciate where the dairy industry now is, it is necessary to look back to 1975-76 when I first became politically involved with the industry. In those days, the farmers of our area were being paid something like 40c a pound for butterfat. The herds were small, the production was poor and there was little concerted research. In my area there was a multiplicity of small processors who were quite weak in respect of technology. The States generally, from one to the other, were in total disarray.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the work that has been done, the current situation is totally different. I am very pleased to see the position that Ken Baxter now holds and the work that he has done. In those early days, we dealt with Ken Baxter in the Parliament when he was working for the then Leader of the Government in the Senate, Ken Wriedt. Of all the jobs that he has been involved in since then, I am very pleased to see him back in the dairy industry where he did well in those very difficult days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is now very good research. There have been many factory amalgamations and herd build-ups. There has been much improvement in the machinery, buildings and plant used and in artificial breeding. Production per cow is up about 50 per cent on what it was in those days. The quality is better than we ever imagined was possible, and it is uniform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry has changed so much in terms of what it now produces. In those days it was basically a butter industry. It then went through the phase of being a cheddar cheese industry. The main parts of the industry are now built around the fancy cheeses and the various powders&mdash;whole milk, skim milk and whey. The organisation has done very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to give great commendations to the work of Pat Rowley and John Frearson. Pat came into the operations at a time when the major dairying States were having difficulty getting agreement. After years of work, Pat has been able to get the industry into a very solid position. With the more recent approach of Ken Baxter, I am very hopeful that the industry can do well in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, Tasmania has done very well with its dairy farmers. The factories concerned have made products that have put Tasmanian dairy industries on the map. United Milk Tasmania Ltd, the Lactos company and the King Island company are all now very famous for their excellent products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dairy farmers have also been able to make dairying highly competitive as far as land use is concerned. In a State where there is not a lot of first-class land and where that land is now in high competition with vegetable growers, the dairy farmers are now able to compete and are doing very well. I congratulate the farmers and the industry processors on the results that they have had in shows around Australia and overseas. I look forward to a continually improving dairy industry in the years ahead. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few brief comments about this. I first asked Senator Tate, the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, about this report over three weeks ago. I subsequently made it public last week by seeking to have it tabled in the Senate. When he expressed concern that there might be information contained within that report that could be used by those who are trying to defraud Medicare, I changed the notice of motion and sought to have it referred to the Standing Committee on Community Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was meant to be done by the Minister by last Thursday evening. The Minister sought to not comply with the request of the Senate, which I believe is a very serious matter. The motion was passed formally by the Senate. In fact, there was not even any debate on whether this matter should go through. Yet, come 11.30 last Thursday evening, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) decided that the Senate was not trustworthy and could not be relied upon to keep the matter confidential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find that offensive to the Senate, particularly given the fact that we had been given a blast by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) only the day before, on previous occasions and on the same day again. This Government is showing absolute and utter contempt for the Senate. The mere fact is that we had courteously and respectfully requested this document to be released on a confidential basis so that any material of a sensitive nature would not be put on the public record, and possibly jeopardise prosecutions or anything of that nature. Yet the Minister, Mr Howe, said, `Get lost'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a bit concerned because it now seems to be becoming the trend of this Government to tell the Senate to `get lost'. Fortunately, sanity has now prevailed and Senator Tate has been able to convince Mr Howe&mdash;who incidentally is not only Minister for Health, but also the Deputy Prime Minister and a person who should have a bit more respect for the Parliament and the Senate&mdash;that the whole idea of getting this report on Medicare fraud was designed to inform us as to what the Department was doing and, if there is anything of a confidential nature, that would be respected and certainly not released. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been much work done, particularly by Minister Tate's office, by the coalition benches and by Senator Lees on behalf of the Democrats on this occasion, to make sure that the Senate is informed exactly what the Department is doing about Medicare fraud. I understand from the information I have been given&mdash;and obviously I have not yet seen a report&mdash;that this report involves something like $60m worth of Medicare fraud. That is quite a substantial amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also involves what the Government has or has not done when it comes to trying to detect fraud in various areas. One of the matters that I am concerned about is that there is an indication that the number of investigators into Medicare fraud has been dramatically reduced. If on the one hand we are talking about a $60m fraud and yet on the other we are reducing the number of investigators, then what is this Government doing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously it is up to the Senate to decide what is going on, because clearly the House of Representatives will not do anything. I have known of the existence of this report for six to eight weeks, and yet Mr Howe has continued as of today to say, `We have to rush it together, rush it together, rush it together'. That is simply not on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter I really want to highlight is the contempt in which this Government appears to hold the Senate. The Deputy Prime Minister of this country, following fast on the heels of the Prime Minister of this country, is insulting the Senate to that degree. Madam Acting Deputy President, you are a member of a committee which has had particularly confidential information provided to it from the National Crime Authority. It is a shame that members of the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister of this country do not appreciate the fact that there should be proper scrutiny of government, of departments and of where the taxpayers' dollar is spent. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the reports.</PARA>
<PARA>The first report I have just tabled relates to facilities for an increased Army presence in the north, stage 1. The proposal relates to the Defence Force structure review announced by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) on 30 May 1991. One of the findings of the review determined that a regular Army brigade be permanently based in Darwin by the end of the decade. This will be achieved by the staged relocation of southern based units to Darwin. Approximately 2,200 service personnel will be relocated under stages 1 and 2 which will take place between 1994 and 2001. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report relates to the need to provide suitable working, training and accommodation facilities for personnel relocating under stage 1. The proposal consists of the construction of new facilities on the Defence property near Palmerston, 20 kilometres east of Darwin; the construction of new facilities and refurbishment of existing facilities at RAAF base Darwin for an aviation squadron; acquisition and development of an additional close training area; and acquisition of a commercial property for logistics functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As regards the new facilities on the Defence property near Palmerston, it is not a Club Med, but the construction, design and architecture of that facility is second to none. Having seen it, I believe it is a very wise and efficient use of resources and it is certainly a very visually pleasing and functional structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Related to this proposal is the provision of an additional 350 married quarters by the Defence Housing Authority, for which furniture is to be provided out of this proposal. The estimated total cost of the proposed scope of works in outturn price is $199.74m. This equates to $173.95m at February 1992 prices. It is proposed that the stage 1 works will be contracted in a number of separate contract packages of varied sizes to optimise local industry involvement. Subject to all necessary approvals, current plans envisage the commencement of construction by the end of 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second report relates to the redevelopment of Larrakeyah Barracks in Darwin. Although there has been a gradual increase in Army strength in the north since the 1970s, there has been little development of facilities within the barracks. There is a shortage of suitable working accommodation and existing facilities are in poor condition. Although maintenance has been carried out, there has never been an upgrade of the type proposed in this referral. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objectives of the proposed redevelopment are to provide suitable working accommodation for units located within Larrakeyah Barracks; provide suitable living-in accommodation for personnel posted to units located within Larrakeyah Barracks; provide suitable accommodation for transit and headquarters NORCOM augmentation personnel; replace the large number of temporary facilities within the barracks with permanent facilities; and incorporate elements of the Darwin Naval base redevelopment stage 2. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two Aboriginal sacred sites exist within the site, namely, the Emery Point precinct and a sacred tree adjacent to the guardhouse. The Committee was advised by the Department of Defence that discussions have taken place with guardians of the site. As a result of these discussions, power lines will remain above ground and the Committee is pleased to note that the Aboriginal guardians have been issued with passes which allow them access to the area at any time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The heritage value of building 27 on the site continues to be a matter of discussion between the Department of Defence and the heritage authorities. Although the Committee doubts the heritage value of this building, it acknowledges the Department of Defence's policy of liaising with environmental bodies until differences are resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimate of total project cost in outturn price is $28.629m. This equates to $26.4m at January 1992 prices. It is proposed the works will be contracted with a number of separate contract packages. Subject to the necessary approvals, it is proposed that construction will commence in late 1992 and will be completed by mid-1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's twelfth report concerns provision of new and refurbished warehouse facilities for the Defence National Storage and Distribution Centre (DNSDC), primarily at Moorebank, New South Wales, and a number of other centres. The project examined by the Committee is a significant part of the Defence logistics redevelopment project which will implement a centralised strategy of wholesale storage and distribution for the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has recommended that the project, which is estimated to cost $100m, should proceed. The Committee believes that the concept of a Defence National Storage and Distribution Centre would result in manpower savings and savings in recurrent expenditure, and would avoid duplication and double handling of stores items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Committee's public hearing into the proposal, the Zetland unions put forward an alternative proposal which would involve retaining the naval stores at Zetland as part of the centre. After careful consideration of this proposal from the unions, the Committee has concluded that the location of the centre at Moorebank offers the advantages of reduced costs and recurrent expenditure, increased efficiency, capacity for expansion and improved security over the Zetland alternative. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, because the completed project will involve manpower savings which will be spread over a number of years, the Committee has recommended that there should be continuing consultation between Defence and the workforces at all establishments at which redundancies are programmed to occur to ensure that the personnel involved are assisted in finding alternative employment. A formal mechanism to achieve this objective should be established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's inquiry also focused on fire detection and prevention measures to be provided at the Centre. The Committee has recommended that during the development of the proposal and after the work has been completed Defence should continue formal liaison, including site visits, with the NSW fire brigades. The Committee has also recommended that as part of the study of fire risks throughout all Defence installations currently being undertaken, a formal risk management analysis of existing and proposed facilities be carried out by an independent professionally qualified fire safety consultant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence acknowledged that the tri-Service warehousing operation proposed for the DNSDC is dependent on the Supply Systems Redevelopment Project&mdash;SSRP&mdash;being delivered on time. The SSRP aims to create a common core computing system to cater for the supply needs of the Australian Defence Force. The SSRP has had a chequered history and was the subject of a report recently by our colleagues on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The Committee has recommended the DNSDC project should proceed on the assumption that funds and other resources required to complete the SSRP on time will be provided.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ANTARCTIC (ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill gives effect to Australia's obligations arising from the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, known as the Madrid Protocol. The Madrid Protocol designates Antarctica as a natural reserve devoted to peace and science, and puts in place a legally binding and comprehensive regime for protection of its environment. The Government has shown leadership in Antarctic environmental matters and already has made significant progress in implementing the requirements of the Protocol. This Bill will enable Australia to move forward to ratification of the Protocol.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Madrid Protocol stands among the world's most significant environmental agreements. It is unique in setting out to ensure the protection of the environment of an entire continent. It is an outstanding demonstration of countries working together on environmental protection. Australia thus takes great pride in its role in leading its Treaty partners to adoption of the Protocol in October 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Elsewhere in the world in recent years we have seen attention given to the long-standing problems of pollution, insensitive development, and uncontrolled exploitation of resources. We have learned from our mistakes. In Antarctica we had a continent seemingly immune from the environmental problems, but our view of Antarctica changed as we came to understand what is happening in the atmosphere. It was Antarctica that revealed the depletion of ozone. Antarctica is a continent of enormous scientific potential; a continent that may provide invaluable information about the health of the environment in the rest of the world. The Government recognised that Antarctica can only do this if we fully protect it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Antarctica, once far removed from the attention of most of the world, came to prominence in the 1980s. The decade saw dramatic developments in Antarctic environmental policy, reflecting the increased attention given to the environment worldwide.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Antarctica's unique environment provides the setting for a unique approach to international relations. For over thirty years the Antarctic Treaty has set aside the differences between countries and provided the framework for unrivalled cooperation between the 40 countries that are party to it. As an original signatory to the Treaty, Australia is fully committed to supporting the Antarctic Treaty and encouraging the consensus approach to decisions about Antarctica's future. The Government therefore believes that by strong support for, and effective contribution to, the Treaty system we can achieve the best possible measures to protect the Antarctic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without doubt, the most significant recent development in the Antarctic Treaty system was the adoption in 1991 of the Madrid Protocol. Adoption of the Protocol represented a dramatic change in attitude by the Treaty countries to what are acceptable activities in Antarctica. Following six years of negotiation of a regime that would allow the possibility of mining in Antarctica, the Treaty parties have agreed to a regime that prohibits mining. The Government's leadership on this issue was instrumental in achieving what is now recognised as one of the world's most outstanding examples of international cooperation in protection of the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Negotiation of the Protocol followed the Government's decision in May 1989 that Australia would not sign the Antarctic minerals convention. The Government had concluded that mining could not be undertaken consistent with protection of the environment. Instead, the Government proposed that Treaty parties negotiate a regime which would prohibit mining and provide for comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Government announced its decision it was warmly welcomed by the public. However, overseas Australia's proposals were not received enthusiastically by many of our Treaty partners. The then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, acknowledged in his announcement that we had set ourselves an ambitious task. However, concerted efforts by the Government culminated in the adoption of the Protocol after some two years. The Government takes this opportunity to place on record its appreciation for the skilful negotiation efforts of officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Antarctic Division of the Department of Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During these negotiations Australia was supported initially by France. Italy and Belgium also came to support our proposals and following a meeting of Treaty parties in November 1990, further support for the Australian position emerged. In Madrid, less than a year later, the Treaty parties adopted the Protocol signalling achievement of the objective of putting in place comprehensive and legally binding measures to protect the Antarctic environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prohibition on mining</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the context in which the Protocol was negotiated, its most significant feature is Article 7 which prohibits activities relating to mineral resources other than scientific research. This Article represents the commitment of the Treaty parties to set aside a whole continent from what was potentially one of the most environmentally destructive activities. The Government had, of course, recognised the need to provide legal means to prevent such activities in 1990, prior to conclusion of the Protocol, and we had passed legislation prohibiting mining in the Australian Antarctic Territory and prohibiting Australian involvement in mining anywhere in the Antarctic. This legislation, the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Act 1991, will now be incorporated in the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980 for the sake of completeness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is, of course, delighted that the Protocol has put in place the mining prohibition that we sought. However, the Protocol is much more than a ban on mining, and there are many other significant environmental protection provisions within the Protocol and its annexes. These provisions will ensure that activities undertaken in Antarctica are done in the most environmentally responsible way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Annexes to the Madrid Protocol</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Key features of the Protocol are that it designates Antarctica as a natural reserve devoted to peace and science; it establishes environmental principles for the conduct of all activities in Antarctica; and subjects all activities to prior assessment of their environmental impacts. Accordingly, the Protocol provides for a whole continent to be recognised as a place worthy of protection, and a place where all activities should be approached with consistent environmental standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time of adoption of the Protocol, on 4 October 1991, four annexes had been agreed. These provide detailed measures relating to environmental impact assessment; conservation of Antarctic fauna and flora; waste disposal and waste management; and prevention of marine pollution. Subsequently, the Treaty parties adopted a fifth annex relating to area protection and management. Most of these provisions will be covered by this Bill, which amends the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act in a number of ways to ensure that our Protocol obligations are met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The environmental impact assessment process</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A fundamental part of the Protocol's mechanisms to ensure that activities take account of environmental values is Annex I. The Protocol requires prior assessment of all activities proposed to be conducted in the Antarctic Treaty area to assess likely impacts on the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems. Annex I specifies the procedures that are to be followed to ensure that proposed activities are appropriately assessed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intention of the environmental impact assessment process is not to prevent activities from proceeding but rather to ensure that they are undertaken in a way that takes into account, and minimises as far as practicable, any environmental impacts. The Bill puts in place an assessment scheme that relies on three levels of impact assessment according to the extent of likely impacts, and provides for conditions to be imposed on activities so that the actual impacts can be assessed and verified. The Bill provides for regulations to be made relating to detailed aspects of the procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conservation of Antarctic fauna and flora</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the years the Antarctic Treaty parties have adopted a number of measures in relation to the protection of fauna and flora. These measures have been put into place in the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act. Annex II of the Protocol replaces many of the existing measures, strengthening them where necessary. Consequently, as the existing measures have been implemented into Australian law, this Bill proposes to amend that Act by incorporating the additional requirements of the Protocol relating to the protection of fauna and flora.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Annex II includes a provision prohibiting the introduction of non-indigenous species into the Antarctic. One aspect of the requirements is the obligation to remove huskies from Antarctica by 1 April 1994. Within Australia the Government's acceptance of this provision has been difficult. Australia is one of only three Treaty countries that still uses dog teams in Antarctica and during negotiation of the Protocol Australia argued strongly for retention of the dogs. However, our position became untenable in view of Australia's strong push for comprehensive environment protection measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only one of Australia's Antarctic stations still maintains dogs. Even though the dogs at Mawson are well managed there remains the possibility of dogs breaking free and attacking wildlife, or wildlife straying into the dog lines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is arranging to remove the dogs in accordance with its obligations as a signatory to the Protocol and consistent with the decision of the Treaty Parties to implement the Protocol as far as possible pending its entry into force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Waste disposal and management</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Annex III of the Protocol, relating to waste disposal and waste management, will largely be implemented by regulations. However, the more serious matters of introducing non-sterile soil, polychlorinated biphenyls and polystyrene beads and chips have been dealt with in this Bill. These have all been identified as posing particular dangers to the environment and their introduction into Antarctica will be prohibited.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As now required by the Protocol, Australia continues with its program of cleaning up past waste sites at its stations and much has been achieved to date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prevention of marine pollution</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Annex IV of the Protocol, relating to the prevention of marine pollution, was implemented earlier this year by way of amendment to the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 which falls within the responsibilities of my colleague the Minister for Transport and Communications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Improved management of protected areas</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Annex V of the Madrid Protocol provides significant improvements to the Antarctic protected areas system. In particular, it rationalises the earlier proliferation of categories of protected areas and allows all sites with values worthy of protection to be subject to an agreed management plan. All existing protected areas will be preserved in the new scheme, with no diminution of the level of protection given to them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The previous protected area system had been provided for in the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act. This Bill modifies those provisions to put in place the requirements of the Annex, while allowing for retention of the old system until Annex V becomes effective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minor and technical amendments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opportunity is also being taken to make some minor and some technical amendments to the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act to clarify or update certain provisions. The proposed amendments will clarify some of the permit provisions; update penalties; make a consequential amendment to provide for the setting up of monitoring sites under the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Act 1981; and reflect an amendment to the Annex to the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals. As well, a minor amendment to the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Act is proposed which will allow other laws in relation to arrest to apply to this Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Entry into force</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill has a number of provisions relating to commencement to reflect the circumstances that surround the ultimate entry into force of the Protocol and its various components, and the need to retain some provisions of the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act pending the varying dates of entry into force of these components.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Protocol will enter into force when all the parties required have taken the steps necessary to ensure that its provisions can be made binding on its citizens. This Bill, together with the regulations to be made under it, will enable Australia to ratify the Protocol. At this stage, only one signatory to the Protocol (Spain) has ratified. While all the necessary parties have signed the Protocol there is still some way to go until it will formally enter into force. Our ratification will firmly demonstrate our commitment to the Antarctic Treaty system, and to protecting the Antarctic environment. It will encourage other countries to similarly proceed to ratification so that the Protocol can enter into force promptly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I said earlier, the Government is proud of its record of providing leadership in protecting the Antarctic environment. That leadership has been recognised in our successful promotion among Treaty partners of the initiative for comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment; in our past and continuing efforts in improving environmental management of our Antarctic activities; and in the progress we are making in implementing the requirements of the Protocol.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's stand on protection of the Antarctic environment has been strongly supported by the Australian community. The negotiation and adoption of the Protocol saw unprecedented cooperation between the Government and the environmental movement. I take this opportunity to record the Government's appreciation of the support that it has received from the environmental organisations who were instrumental in achieving support overseas for Australia's stand. The Government looks forward to continued cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, I believe this legislation will be widely welcomed. I urge members of the Opposition to be equally firm in their support of it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 4) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I move that this Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1992 will amend several Acts within the Attorney-General's portfolio and make minor amendments to a related Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill contains amendments of a minor policy nature and makes minor technical amendments to existing legislation. None of the amendments concern major policy proposals or sensitive policy issues. They are explained in the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments will not have any significant financial impact. However, the amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 will have limited impact on Government expenditure. Any additional expenditure incurred by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will be absorbed within the Commission's present budget. There will be minimum direct cost impact on consumer credit reporting agencies and credit providers as the industry is already operating under the Privacy Act, and the amendments will not significantly require industry to change the way it operates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Bankruptcy Act 1966 will make consequential changes arising from the Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1991 which were inadvertently not made by that amending Act. The Official Receiver will also be a recipient of trustees' notices to creditors of the bankrupt under subsection 19(1B) of the Act stating the trustee's opinion as to whether the bankrupt is eligible to apply for early discharge from bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1991 enables the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy to review decisions of trustees, including trustees' decisions about the bankrupt's application for early discharge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Court's jurisdiction under section 31 of the Bankruptcy Act to hear and determine applications will be amended to require  the Court to hear proceedings relating to the annulment of a bankruptcy where it ought not to have been made, and to remove the requirement to hear objections to discharge, as the Court no longer has specific jurisdiction to deal with such matters. The Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1991 provided that a bankruptcy is annulled by operation of law or if the Court makes an order on the ground that the sequestration order or debtor's petition ought not to have been made. Also, a bankrupt may be discharged by operation of law after three years or may obtain early discharge by administrative process where he or she meets the statutory eligibility and disqualification criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also repeal various spent provisions in the Bankruptcy Act 1966.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will make amendments to subsection 22(8) of the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 which provides that complaints to the Ombudsman under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 shall be dealt with under the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 rather than the Ombudsman Act 1976. Re-arrangement of the provisions for complaints to the Ombudsman in the Freedom of Information Act and deletion of the reference to subsection 6(3) of the Ombudsman Act 1976 in the relevant provisions of the Freedom of Information Act necessitate consequential amendments to subsection 22(8) of the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to the Family Law Act 1975 and the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 will require Registrars and Deputy Registrars of the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Court of Australia to give a promissory oath or affirmation of office before performing delegated judicial of quasi-judicial functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will amend the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 to make it clear that a person represented in a representative proceeding under Part IV of that Act or in a proceeding of a representative character authorised by another Act cannot be ordered to pay costs except in special circumstances. This amendment reaffirms a long line of judicial authority which was said to be wrong in a recent judgment of the Supreme Court of Victoria in respect of statutory provisions in that State dealing with the power of that Court to award costs. The amendment will remove any doubts that may have been created by that decision for proceedings of this kind.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also contains amendments to the Family Law Act 1975, Judges (Long Leave Payments) Act 1979 and the Judges' Pension Act 1968 to state, so as to put the matters beyond doubt, the method of resigning a judicial commission and the conditions affecting the reappointment of the present Judges of the Family Court to the maximum age of 70 now permitted by the Family Law Act. The amendments will state the conditions affecting seniority, long leave payment and pension entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will make miscellaneous amendments to the Freedom of Information Act 1982. The National Companies and Securities Commission was abolished on 31 July 1992 and the Act will be  amended to continue after the abolition an exemption from applications under the Act for documents of the Commission that were exempt under section 47 of the Act prior to that abolition. Section 56 of the Act gives the Administrative Appeals Tribunal the power to hear appeals where an agency has failed to make a decision within the required time limits and the agency is deemed to have made a decision refusing to grant access to a document or refusing to amend or annotate a record of personal information as appropriate. Where an agency makes a decision, between the time the appeal is made to the Tribunal and the time that the Tribunal has finally dealt with the matter, subsection 56(5) gives the Tribunal the power to extend the proceedings by reviewing the decision that has actually been made if the applicant for review wants it to do so and if the agency has not granted the applicant's request in full and in the manner sought. The Bill will allow this to be done at the request of the applicant for review or on the Tribunal's own motion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 58 of the FOI Act sets out the power of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to review decisions under the Act and gives it power to determine the question whether there exist reasonable grounds for the claim on which a certificate issued under subsections 33(4) and 33A(4) is based. Section 33 was amended in 1991 to delete references to the public interest. Section 33A was also amended so that a certificate issued under subsection (2) or (4) conclusively establishes both that disclosure would affect relations with a State or Territory and that disclosure would not on balance be in the public interest. The Bill contains a consequential amendment to section 58 so that the grounds for appeal will be consistent with the grounds for exemption.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 58C of the Act requires certain proceedings of the Tribunal to be held in private including proceedings where certificates have been given under subsections 33(4) and 33A(4). As a consequence of the amendments to sections 33 and 33A, the Act requires amendment to re-establish consistency between section 58C and sections 33 and 33A.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 in the Schedule to the Bill will revise the provisions already made in the Act for the mortgage securitisation industry and expand it to include asset backed securitisation. The amendments will also deal with a number of anomalies in the credit reporting provisions of the Privacy Act that have been brought to the Government's attention by industry and the Privacy Commissioner in the course of implementing those provisions. The proposed amendments have the support of the Privacy Commissioner and have been prepared after consultations with interested parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Securitisation is a recent development in the credit industry. While provision for it was made in the Privacy Act when it was amended by the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Act 1991, the complexity of the industry has required clarification and revision of the current provisions, which as a matter of strict law do not always easily accommodate the particular practices involved in asset and mortgage securitisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Securitisation, which is also known as the secondary mortgage market, refers to a method of financing often used in housing finance, but is also used in relation to other assets. A mortgage financed ostensibly by a credit union or building society (usually called an `originator'), will under a mortgage securitisation arrangement be ultimately financed by using funds invested by investors in a trust. The form of such arrangements vary significantly, but usually there is a formal legal `trustee' of the trust fund, although the fund is often managed on a day to day basis by a trust manager. The trust manager deals with `credit enhancers' who actually take the financial risk by underwriting the securitisation scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will define a securitisation arrangement and will deem bodies involved in a securitisation arrangement to be credit providers. They will be placed under the same obligations as other credit providers under the Act while they are performing a task relevant to the securitisation scheme. They will, however, be different from other credit providers in that they will be able to obtain credit information from other members of the scheme without the consent of the borrower. This variation of the Act's normal policy on disclosure of information by credit providers is necessary as a result of the special nature of mortgage securitisation schemes. A consequence of deeming bodies involved in mortgage securitisation arrangements to be credit providers is that credit enhancers will be able to obtain access to credit reports from credit reporting agencies in their own right.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fundamentally, the amendments do not represent a major change from the policy of the existing provisions. However, they will clarify the circumstances under which bodies involved in securitisation arrangements can have access to consumer credit information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has been conscious for some time of the difficult situation faced by guarantors or would be guarantors in finding out information about the persons they are guaranteeing. Equally, credit providers lack certainty in deciding what information they are required or permitted by law to disclose to would be guarantors, given that such disclosures are exceptions to their duty of confidentiality to their clients and the information that can be disclosed can vary with the circumstances of the transaction. I am therefore proposing an amendment to the Privacy Act to provide that credit providers may disclose credit information regulated by the Privacy Act (that is, relating to a borrower's consumer credit worthiness) to guarantors or would be guarantors where the borrower has consented to the disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In framing this amendment the Government has been conscious that further consideration is being given to the disclosure of information to guarantors in relation to the implementation of the Martin Committee Report on banking. Thus, for guarantees entered into after the commencement of the provisions, the Bill does not seek to address what information should be disclosed or when information should be disclosed to guarantors. However, for guarantees in existence at the time of the commencement of these provisions, the amendments would permit disclosure of information to a guarantor where that information is relevant to the guarantor's liability or possible liability under the guarantee and the borrower has been notified that such disclosures to the guarantor may take place in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also amend the Privacy Act 1988 to permit credit providers who have mortgages over the same property to share credit information where the borrower is more than 60 days in default.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has received complaints from consumers who have authority to use a partner's account but are not permitted under the Privacy Act to receive information about that account to assist them in making payments and otherwise managing the account. Therefore, to meet these concerns the Bill will permit the disclosure of basic information concerning that account, such as the account balance, the amount of available credit on the account, the minimum payment due, and some information about transactions to the person authorised to operate the account. However, in order to protect the privacy of the account owner, information about the owner's transactions will not be disclosed to that person. Thus, children who are permitted by their parents to use their parent's credit card will not have access to information concerning the parent's credit transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The balance of the amendments correct anomalies or adjust the operation of the Act as a result of the experience gained since the credit reporting provisions became fully operational in February this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I table the explanatory memorandum for the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I move that this Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to implement a package of measures to enhance the future of the Australian wheat industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The package provides a framework for the development of a vertically integrated industry to the end of the century. It has the endorsement of the peak wheat grower body, the Grains Council of Australia. The Grains Council agreement on these measures exemplifies the Government's approach to rural industry policy. We have strong views on where our rural industries should be heading and a clear vision for their future. But we do not impose changes on those industries. We consult closely with them on proposed improvements and work together to attain our shared vision for their future. This is the approach the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has recently adopted with the dairy, wool and sugar industries and which he has now applied to the wheat and grains industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such an approach gives greater confidence to industry participants in planning their futures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wheat is Australia's most valuable crop with an estimated gross value of production in 1992-93 of $2.2 billion. Wheat is also one of Australia's most important exports and this year will be our third largest rural export earner after wool and meat.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This package has regard to the particular circumstances of the industry and the environment in which it operates. It represents a further step in the evolution of wheat marketing arrangements. For many years the Australian Wheat Board held a monopoly over the sales of all Australian wheat on domestic and export markets. Three years ago this Government deregulated the domestic wheat market and thereby introduced competition to the Wheat Board within Australia. Since then, on export markets, the Wheat Board has moved further away from being a supplier of bulk homogenous wheat and instead has also pursued niche markets for specific qualities of wheat based on customers' needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes helped inspire the Grains Council to hold the "Grains 2000 Conference" in September 1991. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy gave the concluding address to the Conference where he set out his views on future directions for the industry. He stressed the long term decline in the terms of trade for Australian agricultural producers and pointed out that, on the other hand, growth in the trade of value added food products was increasing. Moreover, he said Australia was well situated to take advantage of the growth in demand for these products in the populous and increasingly wealthy countries of Asia. He urged the industry to raise its sights and direct more of its resources to take advantage of the growth in demand for value added food products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At that Conference, industry leaders shared many of the views of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy on a future vision for the industry. Grains Council leaders Andrew Inglis and Donald McGauchie and Wheat Board Chairman Clinton Condon also spoke of the need for the industry to move away from being solely a supplier of bulk raw material.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two other important issues raised at the Conference were the export powers of the Wheat Board and the future capital base for the industry. Both of these issues, as well as value adding, are addressed in the package implemented by this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following Grains 2000, an extensive process of consultation was set up by the Grains Council with the involvement of the Wheat Board and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Expert consultants were engaged to advise on the financial and structural aspects of future grains marketing. This process led to the publication in April this year of what became known as the Newco proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the months following, the Grains Council organised an extensive series of grower meetings in all mainland States to debate the Newco proposal. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy welcomed these meetings, as a means of ensuring growers were fully consulted on the issues. The Minister had earlier expressed reservations about some aspects of the proposal. Moreover, after the consultative process was complete, it was clear the Newco proposal in its original form did not have the support of the majority of growers. Nor did the alternative proposals which had been put forward over the last year or so, such as those from various State grower bodies and from the Australian Grain Exporters Association.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, there was general support for certain elements of these proposals and this support has been embodied in the package of measures before the Senate. These elements are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a continued build up in the industry's capital base through the Wheat Industry Fund Levy;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a more active role for the Wheat Board in grains based value adding activities; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a continuation of the Wheat Board's export monopoly in light of the current uncertain outcome in the GATT Round and the highly corrupted state of the world wheat market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe the continued build up of a capital base is essential to ensure the industry's future. Such a view is shared by the industry. Currently, the Wheat Board borrows heavily during the season to make advance payments to growers. Those borrowings are guaranteed by the Government under an arrangement which was scheduled to end on 30 June 1994. The financial consultants to the Grains Council and the Wheat Board have estimated that the Wheat Industry Fund would need to build to over $400m to provide sufficient capital for the Wheat Board to make advance payments to growers at around current levels without a Government guarantee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government and the Grains Council have therefore agreed that the Fund will continue for five years past 1994, until June 1999. By that time, it is estimated the Fund will have reached a level sufficient for the Wheat Board to make advance payments without the Government guarantee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During this build up period, the Government has agreed to continue its guarantee on borrowings by the Wheat Board until June 1999 at a level of 85 per cent of the aggregate estimated net pool return. This extension of the guarantee will provide a welcome and necessary breathing space for wheat growers during the build up period and will remove any uncertainty about the future of the Wheat Board's borrowing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the build up period, the Government's firm intention is that the Government guarantee will cease as it will no longer be necessary for the Wheat Board's operations. It is also the Government's view that the Wheat Board will be able to be corporatised at the end of the build up period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Turning now to value adding activities, this Bill grants the Wheat Board the power to become directly involved in grains based value adding activities, subject to constitutional limitations. This will enable a broadening of the economic base of the grains industry and the strengthening of linkages between growers and processors. Until now, the Wheat Board's involvement in value adding has been limited to investment only.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides this value adding power to the Wheat Board for export and interstate trade. Complementary State legislation will be necessary to cover intrastate trade, as is the case with the Wheat Board's powers under the current legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, the Grains Council and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy have agreed that the Wheat Board will establish a subsidiary specifically for grains based value adding activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intention of the industry and Government is that these activities will mainly involve joint venture arrangements. The subsidiary will be able to draw on Wheat Industry Fund equity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exact form of the Wheat Board subsidiary has not yet been finalised. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy intends to consult further within Government and with industry on this. However, he intends that members of the board of the subsidiary will be selected by the Australian Wheat Board in consultation with him as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and with the Grains Council. The board of the subsidiary will reflect an appropriate mix of skills and will include representatives of both the growing and processing sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wheat Industry Fund will also continue to be used for the Wheat Board's trading division operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is expected that the Fund will be used until 1999 as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">around 80 per cent of future contributions for building up the capital base;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">around 20 per cent of future contributions together with around $30m of current equity for value adding activities by the Wheat Board's subsidiary company; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">around $100m of current equity for the Wheat Board's trading division operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The investment and use of the Fund both by the Wheat Board and its subsidiary will be subject to the same safeguards for growers which currently operate, that is, in accordance with a business plan approved annually by the Grains Council. Any profits made by the subsidiary from the use of Fund monies will be returned to the Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government guarantee of Wheat Industry Fund borrowings will cease on 30 June 1994, as provided in the current legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the question of the Wheat Board's export monopoly, it is clear the majority of growers favour the continuation of the Wheat Board's single desk export operations. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is aware of calls from some growers, and certainly from other commercial interests such as the Australian Grain Exporters Association, to introduce at least a degree of deregulation in Australian export wheat sales. However, the Government has decided that now is not the appropriate time to change the Wheat Board's export powers. All honourable senators will be aware of the corrupt state of the world wheat market where the subsidy war between the United States and the European Community has been waged for many years now. The intensity of the war has recently increased with President Bush's global Export Enhancement Program announcement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will continue to work towards a successful outcome in the GATT Uruguay Round. However, the outcome of the Round is still uncertain, an important reason why the Government believes no change should be made at this time to the single desk export status of the Wheat Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will review these export powers after the current GATT Round outcome is clearer and as any successful reforms arising from the Round become effective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the package of measures I have outlined today will provide substantial benefits to the Australian wheat industry. The package will enable the build up of a capital base, bolstered by a continuation of the Government borrowing guarantee at 85 per cent until 1999. Growers can face the long term future secure in the knowledge that their strong national marketing structure will continue. The establishment of a value adding subsidiary of the Wheat Board will provide a new focus for this important aspect of the vision for the future shared by the Government and the Grains Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposals put forward in the Bill will not directly affect Government expenditure although the Government's contingent liability in respect of the Wheat Board's underwritten borrowings will be increased.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will amend the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to increase the low income thresholds below which people are not required to pay any levy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For 1992-93, individuals with taxable incomes of up to $11,887 and married couples and sole parents with family incomes of up to $20,070 will not be required to pay the levy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The income threshold for married couples and sole parents will increase by a further $2,100 for each dependent child or student. For example, a married couple with two dependent children will pay no levy until their combined taxable incomes exceed $24,270.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not proposed to amend the PAYE schedules to take account of the change until 1 July 1993. The number of people from whom the levy is deducted in PAYE instalments and who would be affected by the change would be relatively small.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the administrative costs for the Australian Tax Office and compliance costs for employers of changing the PAYE schedules would be substantial.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated cost of the increased low income thresholds is nil in 1992-93, $12 million in 1993-94 and $6 million in 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of this Bill.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">  TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL   (No. 5) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects. It includes measures to implement a number of changes announced in the 1992-93 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One Budget announcement to be given effect by this Bill is an amendment to allow a deduction for certain environment protection expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another gives effect to the amendments to the tax concession for expenditure on research and development activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another announcement to be implemented will reduce the current write-down available to horse breeding stock.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further amendment relates to the non-deductibility of interest and other borrowing expenses on moneys borrowed to finance personal superannuation contributions and certain life insurance premiums.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other measures announced in the Budget to be implemented by this Bill include a withholding tax on royalties paid to non-residents, an increase in the zone rebates and new arrangements for gifts to environmental organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also gives effect to four recent announcements. It will amend the gift provisions of the income tax law to allow gifts to the Australia-United States Coral Sea Commemorative Council, as announced by the Treasurer on 18 June 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 30 June 1992 the Treasurer announced that section 70B of the Assessment Act would be amended so that losses of capital, or of a capital nature, that are incurred on the disposal or redemption of traditional securities will not be deductible under that section, nor losses arising from the waiver or release of a debt. This Bill gives effect to that announcement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It amends the provisional tax provisions to implement concessions announced by the Treasurer in July.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also gives effect to the acting Treasurer's announcement on 25 September 1992 that the rules relating to depreciation of plant and equipment installed on Crown leases will be amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Corresponding changes are to be made to the capital allowance for expenditure on income-producing buildings and structural improvements and to the development allowance provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another amendment provides for a deferral (or "rollover") of assessable adjustments that may arise on the disposal of property to which the Research and Development provisions have applied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The various capital allowance rollover relief provisions are to be amended so that certain transactions are not inappropriately denied rollover relief.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments include provisions to make the capital gains tax provisions easier to read, modifications to the foreign source income provisions and a new provision to enable taxpayers to pay their tax liabilities through the Billpay or  Electronic Funds Transfer systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Bill will amend the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987 to correct two technical deficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Environment protection expenditure</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will allow a deduction for environment protection expenditure incurred on or after 19 August 1992 in the year in which it is incurred. This measure results from a Treasury Review of the tax treatment of environment-related expenditure begun in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Environment protection expenditure is expenditure incurred for the sole or dominant purpose of preventing, combating or rectifying pollution or treating, cleaning up, storing or removing waste.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The deduction will be allowable to taxpayers for environment protection expenditure where the waste or pollution was produced by their income-producing activity, past, present or proposed. It will be allowable where the waste or pollution is on a site of the taxpayer's income-producing activities, past, present or proposed. And it will be allowable where the waste or pollution is on a site on which the taxpayer's predecessor in the same business carried it on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Plant, equipment, buildings and structures (including certain environmental earthworks of a permanent character) are depreciated or written-off, in the same way when they are used for environment protection activities as when they are used for the purpose of producing assessable income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A reliable costing of the measure cannot be made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Research and Development</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill proposes changes to the R&amp;D tax concession arising from a review of the concession. These changes were announced in the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first change is that the maximum rate of deduction for R&amp;D expenditure will continue at 150 per cent. The rate was to be reduced to 125 per cent from 30 June 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second change will remove the limit of $10 million that currently applies to pilot plant used in R&amp;D activities. The full cost of pilot plant acquired or commenced to be constructed on or after 19 August 1992 will be able to be claimed over three years as R&amp;D expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third change will deny deductions for R&amp;D expenditure where the expenditure is financed by syndicates or other financing schemes under which investors are guaranteed some return on or of their investment and a government body is involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not intend to prevent Government business enterprises that operate on a fully commercial basis from offering investors in R&amp;D syndicates guarantees in the same way as non-Government enterprises. So a further amendment, will be made to allow for the gazettal of guidelines for determining when Government business enterprises operate on a fully commercial basis. R&amp;D deductions will not be denied to investors in R&amp;D syndicates involving such bodies, even if some guarantees are offered. The guidelines will be developed by the Industry Research and Development Board, in consultation with relevant interested parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also contains amendments to the Industry Research and Development Act 1986. These amendments will confer power on the Industry Research and Development Board to refuse to register or revoke the registration of companies undertaking R&amp;D activities that are to be financed by an ineligible finance scheme. The Board will be required to develop public guidelines for determining whether finance schemes are ineligible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will apply to pilot plant acquired or commenced to be constructed on or after 19 August 1992, and to finance schemes entered into for R&amp;D activities on or after 19 August 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes to the R&amp;D concession are estimated to cost $110 million in 1994-95 and $125 million in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Horse breeding stock valuation option</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill contains amendments that will replace the special live stock option available to horse breeders under the trading stock provisions of the income tax law. The new valuation option will be available for breeding stock acquired under a contract entered into on or after 19 August 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Horse breeders will continue to have the option of valuing breeding stock on hand at the end of a year of income at cost or market selling value. Similarly, the Commissioner will continue to have the discretion to accept another value where it is warranted by the particular circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new special valuation option will enable a horse breeder to write down the value of a sire by up to 25% of cost. Brood-mares will be able to be written-down so that the value is $1 at the end of the year of income in which the mare is aged twelve. The maximum rate at which a brood-mare may be written down in any one year is 33 1/3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment will result in the period over which a sire or brood-mare is written down for the purposes of the trading stock provisions being more in line with normal "breeding life".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also takes the opportunity to present the law more simply and clearly. This is done by providing two sections, one to value breeding horses as trading stock, and one to value other live stock as trading stock.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The savings from this measure are expected to be $7 million in 1993-94, $8 million in 1994-95 and $5 million in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Non-deductibility of interest</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also amend the tax laws to deny an income tax deduction for interest and other borrowing expenses on moneys borrowed to finance personal superannuation contributions and certain life insurance premiums.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures will apply to interest and other borrowing expenses incurred on loans entered into after 18 August 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will reduce the potential for future losses to the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Royalty withholding tax</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Budget announcement to be given effect by this Bill will introduce a final withholding tax of 30%&mdash;subject to reduction on a reciprocal basis by Double Tax Agreement&mdash;on royalties paid to non-residents to replace the existing assessment system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The change will serve to counter tax avoidance, will produce administrative savings, will improve service to taxpayers through simplified administrative procedures, and will be in accord with the move to self-assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal will also bring Australia into line with the approach adopted by our major trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The UK, USA, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, New Zealand and almost all other OECD countries apply a flat rate withholding tax to the gross amount of royalty payments to non-residents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of a withholding tax is estimated to yield additional revenue of $50 million a year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it is expected that this revenue will not result in any general increase in costs to non-resident technology exporters or Australian technology users since the tax paid by the non-residents will generally give rise to a foreign tax credit in the home country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over 85% of Australian sourced royalties are received by residents of the USA, UK, Germany and Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of these countries have foreign tax credit systems and the net effect will therefore be a transfer of revenue from those countries to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another amendment contained in this Bill will remove uncertainty about the meaning of a "royalty" by making it clear that the law covers satellite and cable transmissions which to some extent have replaced films and video and audio tapes covered specifically by the present law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Zone and related rebates</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill includes the measures announced in the Budget to increase the fixed dollar amounts in the zone and related rebates by 25% from 1 January 1993.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will amend the taxation law to implement personal tax cuts from 1994-95, and for subsequent income years, as outlined by the Prime Minister in the One Nation statement of 26 February 1992. This gives effect to the Government's commitment to deliver on these tax reductions without resort to the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax. It adds to this Government's unparalleled record in introducing progressive reform of the taxation system and confirms Australia's position under this Government as a fair and low tax country. In 1990, taking account of all levels of government, Australia had the third lowest tax burden in the OECD. Only the United States and Turkey have a lower burden of taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Tax cuts</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reductions in the tax rates will be implemented in two stages from 1 July 1994 and 1 January 1996. New scales of personal tax rates for incomes within the range $20,700 to $50,000 will operate from 1 July 1994. Further reductions in those rates will apply from 1 January 1996. The Bill contains the rate scales to apply for 1994-95, 1996-97 and subsequent income years. As the second reduction in personal tax rates has effect from 1 January 1996, the Bill also contains a composite rate scale for the 1995-96 income year. That scale is obtained from an average of the tax rates to apply from 1 July 1994 and 1 January 1996 respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reductions will result in the current 38 per cent rate for the income range $20,700 to $36,000 being reduced to 30 per cent over a two-year period. This income range will also be widened. After two years, the new 30 per cent rate will apply to the income range $20,700 to $40,000, some $4,000 wider than the current range.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current 46 per cent rate for the income range $36,000 to $50,000 will be reduced to 40 per cent over the same period with a corresponding reduction of $4,000 in the income range to a range of $40,000 to $50,000. This means that for someone earning $28,000 a year, for example, the tax cuts will increase disposable income by about $11 a week. The tax cuts will be reflected in lower pay as you earn deductions from 1 July 1994. For the forward estimate years, the cost to the revenue of the personal tax cuts is estimated at $3.2 billion in 1994-95 and $5.2 billion in 1995-96. The measures are an integral part of the Government's tax reform agenda as detailed in the statement on tax policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Fiscal responsibility</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Budget, the Government indicated its desire to reduce the deficit in 1995-96 to between half and one per cent of GDP after allowing for the cuts to personal income tax. It is possible this outcome could be achieved without resort to any additional revenue measures. The Government did, however, identify three possible measures which could be considered, if necessary, to yield in excess of $2 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the statement on tax policy the Government outlines measures which will have the net effect of reducing the deficit by $2 billion in 1995-96. But in order to put this issue beyond doubt, the Government has gone further and by advancing the date of implementation of those measures the deficit will be reduced by $4.5 billion over the two years 1994-95 and 1995-96. In this way the Government will pursue sensible tax reform based on fairness and efficiency but will also bolster the stance of fiscal policy. The consequence of this action is that the Government is confident that the deficit reduction program implicit in the Budget will be exceeded during the course of the forward estimate years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Tax reform</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since 1983, the Government has radically transformed the taxation system into a more effective, more efficient and fairer system. In the 1990s, the Government will maintain the effectiveness of the existing tax system to meet new challenges and to fund the vital activities of government in providing for the security and development of our nation and the well-being of the people. The Government's taxation policies have consistently produced more equitable sharing of the tax burden and lower marginal tax rates. These policies have been pursued both through changes to the design of the income tax and through the continuous improvement of tax administration and compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1985, we considered and rejected the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax and opted instead to make taxes on the income base more efficient and equitable. In particular, we introduced the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax, which are directed at previously untaxed income received by predominantly high income individuals. Other reforms have been introduced progressively to increase the effectiveness of tax administration and to improve tax compliance. This program has included the introduction of self-assessment of income tax&mdash;supported by substantially upgraded audit programs&mdash;the introduction of the tax file number system and other information reporting, modernisation of tax compliance through a major new computer acquisition program matched with organisational changes in the Tax Office and the reorientation of the Tax Office towards a revision of information and advisory services to taxpayers to assist them in meeting their tax obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's policy approach has resulted in a broader income base and reduced tax evasion and reduced tax avoidance. This approach has enabled the Government to reduce, substantially, marginal tax rates. Since 1983 the top rate has been lowered from 60 per cent to 47 per cent and bottom rate has been cut from 30 per cent to 20 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since 1983, the Government has introduced a range of measures particularly to assist low income earners. For example, cuts to personal income tax rates in January 1991 raised the threshold at which tax is payable from $5,100 to $5,400 and reduced the bottom marginal tax rate from 21c to 20c in the dollar. At the same time, the income level up to which the bottom rate applies was extended from $17,650 to $20,700. By contrast, when this Government took office in 1983, the tax free threshold was set just below $5,000 and the bottom marginal rate of 30c in the dollar applied to incomes up to $19,500, and above that level the rate was 46c in the dollar.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government introduced the family allowance supplement, which provides substantial support for low income families. In the One Nation statement, the Government provided further assistance for low income families by way of increases in FAS of $3 a week per child from the first payday in April 1992. FAS boosts the disposable income of eligible families by up to $60.80 a fortnight for each child aged up to 13 years and the $85.90 for each child aged between 13 to 15 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the benefits to taxpayers income tax rate reductions effected by this Government have supported other initiatives by reducing the incentive to avoid or evade tax. In keeping with this broad tax policy strategy since 1983 of making the income tax fair and of reducing evasion, the Government is now undertaking two further initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Fringe Benefits Tax</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of the fringe benefits tax significantly improved the equity of the tax system because it provided a means of ensuring that income provided in kind was taxed. The FBT was designed with a variety of administrative considerations in mind. The Government believes that it is now appropriate to improve the effectiveness of the FBT, and considerably enhance the fairness of the tax system, by changing the method of calculating the value base of the tax by making it as near to that of income tax as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other legislation provides, that from April 1994, the fringe benefits tax will be levied on the FBT inclusive value of the fringe benefit and FBT payments will be deductible to the employer for income tax purposes. This is equivalent to the tax treatment of salary, where the employee pays income tax on the gross amount of salary and the employer has a tax deduction equal to the gross amount of that salary. The change to the valuation of the FBT base will raise about $2.5 billion over the two year 1994-95 and 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The early introduction of this important legislation will ensure that employers and employees have ample notice of the significant changes to the fringe benefits tax structure. A significant share of the revenue yield of the changes will come from tax exempt government sector employers who have benefited from lower taxes on fringe benefits until now. The Government will discuss this issue with State and Territory governments and local government in the context of the general purpose funding and the next Premiers Conference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is not considering any other changes to the FBT. In particular, we do not propose to alter the classes of FBT exempt organisations, so that religious institutions and public benevolent institutions will continue to be exempt. Special arrangements will be provided, however, for non-government organisations that are non-taxpaying bodies which are subject to FBT at the moment. The Government does intend changing the various special rules that apply to such benefits as education of children of Australian employed overseas and foreign resident employment in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will not alter the methods of calculating FBT payable on cars. Neither will the Government reduce the existing concessions applying to particular benefits, such as remote areas housing. The Government will ensure that the exemptions for recreational and community facilities will cover such facilities provided to the residents of those communities whose work requires them to live in remote areas of Australia, distant from many such community facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Improved compliance</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second source of additional revenues will be a substantial enhancement of the Tax Office's compliance strategies, designed both to further help taxpayers meet their obligations and to enforce greater compliance where necessary. I note in passing that the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee is examining, amongst other things, the help and enforcement aspects of the Tax Office's compliance strategy. The Commissioner of Taxation has provided a report to the Government on means of enhancing tax compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Taxation Office, Minute No. 221 of 15 September 1992 from Mr. J.P. Boucher, Commissioner of Taxation to the Treasurer on income tax compliance/enforcement strategies and the Treasurer's statement on Tax Policy were tabled in the House of Representatives on 16 September 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has endorsed the strategy outlined in the Commissioner's report. We will provide the Australian Taxation Office with the resources necessary to implement that strategy, that is, $114m over the three years from 1993-94 to 1995-96. The strategy involves minimal investment of additional resources to achieve a very significant improvement in revenue and equity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The enhancement strategy will include an extension of the role of information reporting, using the tax file number system. Legislation to achieve these objectives will be introduced following consultations with the Privacy Commissioner. In addition, there will be enhancement of the record keeping and audit programs of the Tax Office. The existing exemptions for pensioners from the tax file number system will continue. Such pensioners will not be affected by the extended reporting requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The strategy builds on the unprecedented action this Government has taken over the past 10 years to close the net on tax evasion and avoidance. It will result in the collection of substantial revenue that would otherwise remain uncollected. It is estimated that an additional $1,700m will be collected over the two years 1994-95 and 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The vast majority of Australians are honest and pay their fair share of tax. The measures are directed at those few Australians who avoid or evade their tax liabilities. Those who choose to oppose these measures are choosing to allow those who are cheating on the tax system to continue to do so at the expense of honest taxpaying members of our community. The combination of help and enforcement strategies as outlined is designed to promote voluntary compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it is designed to benefit the community rather than to impose additional burdens, we are mindful that the proposed enforcement strategy will involve some additional compliance costs. Accordingly, the Government will ensure full consultation on the proposals for enhanced compliance. We will also ensure that taxpayers, particularly business, are given adequate notice of changes and time to adjust systems to such changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Budget papers, the Government referred to possible extensions of the domestic interest withholding tax and the prescribed payments system, measures which would have been aimed at improving compliance. If implemented, such measures would also have significantly brought forward revenue for the Government. In adopting the Commissioner's proposed strategy, the Government accepts his advice that the compliance objective can be met without resort to these two measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The two initiatives will together raise more than $4 billion over 1994-95 and 1995-96. The projected Budget deficit will be reduced as planned to between half and one per cent of GDP in 1995-96. As provided by this Bill, substantial personal income tax cuts will be implemented in two stages from July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government is committed to maintaining and enhancing its fundamental approaches to taxation policy. We will not increase the overall burden of tax. We will not introduce a broad-based consumption tax. We will continue to design tax policy to support saving and investment, responding as necessary to new opportunities, and changing circumstances. In particular, this Government will take to a further stage our commitment to the fundamental strategy of broadening the tax base and reducing tax rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tax rates set out in this Bill provide for substantial reductions in the marginal rates faced by the great majority of working men and women in Australia. The marginal tax rate of people on average earnings will fall from 38c to 30c in the dollar. This will be achieved without resort to any new taxes, let alone the imposition of a crushing tax on the necessities of everyday life and almost everything else consumed by Australians and their families.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that the format in this Bill may become an approach adopted by other portfolios where a large number of minor and technical amendments is included in a Bill. Apart from providing the item numbers, the Explanatory Memorandum gives a detailed explanation of items considered to be of particular interest. This is in answer to criticism that too many technical, but important, changes are `buried' in the Schedules. This approach has not added to the size of the Bill but, of course, has resulted in a longer Explanatory Memorandum. However, that is the price I believe we should be prepared to pay to ensure an adequate explanation of the changes is given.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now discuss some of the more important items in this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The compensation provisions in the Social Security Act 1991 will be extended to cover Carer Pension. At the moment, partners of compensation recipients are already covered and it is logical to have the provisions apply to carers who themselves receive compensation payments. The provisions will also be extended to cover Carer Pensioners irrespective of for whom the care is being provided. Carers who receive a lump sum compensation payment will be treated in the same way as other pensioners who are subject to the compensation provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will clarify the nexus between entitlement to Family Allowance (to be called Family Payment from 1 January 1993) and Child Disability Allowance and Double Orphan Pension. Put simply, a person with a child who attracts Child Disability Allowance or Double Orphan Pension will not attract Family Payment for that child unless the income and assets tests for Family Payment are met. The amendments will, however, make it clear that neither Child Disability Allowance nor Double Orphan Pension is subject to any income or assets test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two amendments to the Pharmaceutical Allowance provisions. The first is a technical amendment to include Pharmaceutical Allowance as part of the rate calculators in the Social Security Act. The second is more important in that it will ensure that a social security recipient who is qualified for the allowance will not receive less than the full Pharmaceutical Allowance rate even if the application of the income or assets tests would otherwise reduce the rate to less than the full rate of allowance (but more than nil). This is consistent with the proposition that the allowance was introduced to compensate social security recipients in full following the initiative to remove access to Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme items free of charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The social security system is both complex and sophisticated in that it tries to target assistance to those most in need. Part of the running of a system which helps millions of Australians involves the extensive use of computers. The Bill will ensure that decisions which might look like `automatic' decisions made by force of law (ie where there is no discretion involved) and put into effect by a computer&mdash;for example, to cancel a payment&mdash;will still be subject to the full review rights embodied in the Social Security Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act at present provides that Newstart Allowance, Job Search Allowance and Sickness Allowance are not payable to a person if the person has not given the Secretary of the Department of Social Security his or her tax file number. The Social Security Act is amended in this Bill to enable the Secretary to request a tax file number as a condition of qualification from claimants of those payments I have mentioned. There is nothing untoward  about this amendment. Similar provisions already exist for other payments but I mention this change as I am conscious of the sensitivities involved in tax file number matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with my firmly held view that personal information provided to the Department should be protected to the greatest extent possible, this Bill introduces amendments which will make it an offence for any person, including an officer of the Department, to access client records unlawfully, for example to "browse" paper files without authority, and a further offence to disclose or deal with information which has been accessed unlawfully. Browsing of computer records is already an offence under the Crimes Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Special Benefit is a discretionary hardship payment and payment is usually limited only to persons in Australia. This Bill will enable payment overseas where there are exceptional circumstances but only for a period of up to 13 weeks. This discretion will cater for very unusual situations, like having to visit a seriously ill relative, but limit overall the amount of payment available to a person outside Australia. I emphasise that payment overseas is to occur only in a very few exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to say that this Bill also includes, by way of a Schedule, the International Social Security Agreement between the Republic of Cyprus and Australia. The Agreement is expected to come into force on 1 January 1993. It is another Agreement to add to our growing list of such Agreements with other countries which protect social security payments for persons who have had residence or made contributions in either country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recognition of the value of Australian Defence Force reservists, the Social Security Act currently allows reservists in training camps to qualify for Job Search Allowance or Newstart Allowance if those camps are inside Australia. The Bill will extend this concession to include reservists attending a training camp overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further concession to recipients of Job Search Allowance and Sickness Allowance who are under 18 year olds will be to exempt child maintenance payments to their parents from the parental income test. This is an acknowledgment that child maintenance is directed at assisting children and only maintenance paid to a recipient's parents which is not for children should be counted under the parental income test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for limited relaxation of the Sickness Allowance rules. These will include provisions which allow for a discretion to backdate payment for up to four weeks following failure to lodge a medical certificate because of the person's medical condition or where there may have been delay in processing a medical certificate; to allow for payments, in certain circumstances, to 15 year olds undertaking a rehabilitation program and to allow for payment where a person might be in full-time education as part of a rehabilitation program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other areas covered by the Bill include the repeal of certain superfluous offence provisions and to limit to 3 months the period within which to lodge a claim for payment when a person's payment is cancelled overseas, without the need to return to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill introduces the substantial enhancements to the social security system announced in the Budget. It continues this Government's responsible and soundly based social security programs which continue to deliver support where it is most needed, but within Budget parameters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rate increases in pensions and benefits as a result of indexation will be available two months early by advancing the 20 March 1993 indexation to 28 January 1993. This means a maximum rate increase of $6 a fortnight for someone who is single and $5.00 a fortnight for each member of a couple. This will ensure that the Government's commitment to maintain the basic pension rate at or above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings is sustained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A series of reforms of Rent Assistance will target those who most need support in the rental market. The flat $25 a week rent threshold which applies at present will be replaced with four different thresholds based on family situation and marital status. These thresholds will be indexed to CPI movements. The rate of Rent Assistance will increase from 50 cents to 75 cents for each dollar of rent paid above the threshold and the maximum rate of Rent Assistance paid to someone with no partner or dependent children will increase by $2 a week. This will mean an increase in Rent Assistance of up to $8.50 per week for a single pensioner without children. Existing Rent Assistance recipients who would be entitled to a lower Rent Assistance payment as a result of these changes will continue to receive their current level of Rent Assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A range of measures aimed at Carer Pensioners reflects the Government's commitment to support these people who fulfil such an important role in our community. Carer Pension will now be available to people caring for severely disabled people aged 16 or over who are not pensioners because they cannot meet the full residence requirements. Under current arrangements, payment of Carer Pension continues while the carer temporarily stops providing care for up to 28 days. This respite period is to be increased to 42 days and carers will not need to remain in Australia during the period. Furthermore, carers will be able to participate in employment, education or training for up to 10 hours per week without affecting their payment, the earnings credit provisions will be extended to them and the bereavement provisions which apply on the death of the person being cared for will be applicable where the person was not the carer's partner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mobility Allowance assists people with disabilities with the costs of transport if they are engaged in employment or vocational training and are unable to use public transport without substantial assistance. This Bill will index Mobility Allowance in line with the CPI from 1 January 1993 and will also increase Mobility Allowance by $10 a fortnight. People who are undertaking job search as part of a Disability Panel activity plan will now have access to Mobility Allowance, as will people working for at least 8 hours a week in a voluntary capacity for charitable, welfare or community organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To reduce the pressure on our young people who live away from the family home, a young person under 18 falling within the definition of "independent young person" will need to have lived away from home for only 18 weeks (rather than the current 6 months) to attract the higher rate of Job Search Allowance or other payments payable in these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Full-time voluntary work is a useful vehicle for unemployed clients, especially those who are long-term unemployed or in particular age groups, to gain work experience, update their skills and make useful employer contacts. The system is being relaxed to allow clients to participate more in voluntary work without affecting their payments. Job Search Allowance recipients for 3 months or more and aged under 18 will now be able to undertake voluntary work for up to 30 days in a year, rather than the current 20. Recipients aged between 18 and 49 will have a similar concession extended to them. The modified voluntary work rules currently applying to over 55 year olds which allows up to 65 days of full-time voluntary work in a calendar year without affecting payment, will now apply from age 50.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People aged 50 and over on either Job Search or Newstart Allowance will benefit from the relaxed reporting  requirements which currently apply to the over 55 year old age group and benefit from the rule for the same age group that the activity test is satisfied if the person earns at least 35% of average weekly earnings from employment entered into on or after 1 January 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill introduces several beneficial changes to Employment and Education Entry Payments from March 1993. The Employment Entry Payment for Disability Support Pensioners is being increased from $200 to $300 and qualification for it will no longer depend on continuous receipt of payment for at least 12 months. An Education Entry Payment of $100 will be introduced for Disability Support Pensioners. Widow B Pensioners and sole parents who are Special Beneficiaries rather than Sole Parent Pensioners because of lack of residence, will now also have an Employment Entry Payment and an Education Entry Payment available to them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Permanent Australian residents and holders of certain temporary entry permits who arrive in Australia on or after 1 January 1993 will have to serve a 26 week waiting period before Job Search, Newstart or Sickness Allowance is paid. For permanent residents special benefit would be available if they satisfy the hardship test. The new restriction will not apply to people granted permission to enter Australia before the announcement of this measure in the Budget on 18 August 1992 or to people entering Australia as the partners of Australian residents of more than 26 weeks' standing, or for people entering under the Refugees, Humanitarian and Special Assistance Program, or people who are accepted as refugees under a Domestic Protection (temporary) Entry Permit. A Migrant Access Package will improve services for clients of non-English speaking background.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing three-tier social security appeals system of internal review, Social Security Appeals Tribunal and Administrative Appeals Tribunal is to be streamlined. People will no longer have access to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal unless they have first gone through the formal internal review mechanism which involves review by an Authorised Review Officer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several amendments taking effect in March 1993 deal with managed investments as they affect the operation of the income test. The rules governing managed investments will be simplified by removing the categorisation of these investments into accruing return investments and market-linked investments. Income for income test purposes will be calculated by multiplying the current value of the investment by its growth rate over the previous 12 months. Any losses assessed on managed investments may be offset against gains during the same period on other managed investments. Offsets will also be available against gains on listed shares and other listed securities from September 1993 when the managed investments rules are extended to listed shares and other listed securities. The income test will take account of growth on the managed investment only for the period during which the investor was a social security client.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Superannuation benefits are also dealt with in this Bill. Money in a complying superannuation or rollover fund  will be disregarded for income test purposes until Age Pension age or until an annuity or pension starts to be paid. Once the person reaches Age Pension age, the investment will be handled under the managed investment rules. If an annuity or pension becomes payable, the rules on annuities or pensions will apply. If a withdrawal is made before Age Pension age, that part of the withdrawal representing growth while the investor was receiving pension, benefit or service pension will be assessed as income for 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From Royal Assent, allocated pensions and other pensions and annuities where the payment can be varied at the recipient's discretion, will be subject to the assets test and will be income tested by multiplying the current asset value by the earning rate of the fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As from April 1993, Commonwealth Fringe Benefits currently available to pensioners who satisfy the Fringe Benefit income and assets tests will be available to all pensioners and to long-term beneficiaries or allowees aged 60 or more. Eligibility for pharmaceutical benefits will be extended to recipients of mobility allowance from March 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are other initiatives in this Bill in such areas as the maintenance income test, indexation of the parental income threshold, Job Search and Sickness Allowances for certain 15 year olds, review of Special Benefit, Remote Area Allowance and service of notices of decisions under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also make some minor and technical amendments to social security and related legislation, including consequential changes arising from the introduction of Family Payment from 1 January 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill was initially introduced in November 1990 by my predecessor Senator Jo Vallentine. I am reintroducing it because of the continuing need to address peace and non-violence within the defence agenda and to support defence personnel's right to make decisions according to their consciences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is based on the notion that major changes have occurred in all matters pertaining to war. War has changed&mdash;the days of face to face combat between huge forces of foot soldiers have gone forever. War has become increasingly dependent on high technology weapons systems, as a result of which we are supposed to become accustomed to such terms as "collateral damage"&mdash;meaning civilian deaths, and "surgical bombing"&mdash;meaning maximum damage for minimum bombs. With the change in warfare, there have been many effects which make people think of war in a completely different way. We are now in an age in which the scope of military activity inflicts unintended casualties and damage simply because of the nature of warfare.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With these changes to the nature of war, and there are many more, there has come a change in many peoples' attitudes to the possibility of their participation. For some, that would preclude any idea of serving in the armed forces at all, and it is pleasing to note that earlier this year the Parliament passed the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill, which will allow people subject to conscription into the armed forces to declare a position of conscientious objection for particular wars.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it is also clear from the experience of the Royal Australian Navy, and the American armed forces at the time of the Gulf War, that some serving members of those forces regarded the war as unjustified and that their consciences could not allow them to serve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill would allow serving members of the Australian Armed Forces to refuse to serve in a particular conflict on the grounds of conscience without incurring a charge of breach of discipline.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Senator Vallentine said in her Second Reading Speech in November 1990 . . .    "It is not a question of discipline. It is an issue of selective objection. It will not undermine the Australian Defence Force because I doubt if many serving military personnel will feel the need to avail themselves of it, but we should recognise the right of those who choose to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been suggested that such a provision would make planning and training difficult, but in fact it should be obvious that to have a situation as confronted the Navy during the Gulf War, the disruption caused by a sailor refusing orders is infinitely worse than being prepared beforehand that some serving personnel will not be available for the particular tour of duty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ability of military authorities to be more certain of the state of readiness of their forces when committing troops to battle will be enhanced if mechanisms exist for dealing with CO status people before embarkation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">War, if we are to tolerate it at all, should be the preserve of those who agree to participate. No person should ever be placed in a position of having to fight against their will and against the dictates of conscience.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is appropriate to reiterate comments made in my May 1992 speech in relation to the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's amendments to the Defence Act of 1903 took a most enlightened step in relation to the right of conscientious objection, namely that people who are conscripted into the ADF should be able to claim objection on grounds of conscience to particular wars or acts of war.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government recognised that the nature of international relations has changed, and that warfare has changed, and that there are people in our society, indeed in all societies, who may not have an overall objection to war, but may believe sincerely that a particular war is morally wrong and that they would not be prepared to be involved. I congratulate the government on this move.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, this enlightened move should also be extended to serving members of the armed forces. How can we say to the people of Australia that they are to take their place in the world fully recognising their responsibilities, and then tell members of the armed forces that they are not adult enough to decide for themselves whether they will fight in particular war operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can we, as a society, claim the power to force a person to engage in war? For many years, the overwhelming response to that question has been yes&mdash;at least for the vast majority. It has been assumed that when the dominant groups of forces in society have decided to take up arms, offensively or defensively, then all "able bodied men" were required to follow suit to indicate their solidarity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In some ways, it was easier in years gone by. It was easy to divide the world into "good and bad" or "them and us". But the world has changed, societies have changed, and individuals have changed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The disintegration of the superpower polarity in the world has made the world less subject to cataclysmic acts of war but more subject to regional conflicts&mdash;precisely the types of conflicts in which peoples' ethnic and religious loyalty is likely to be a factor in determining whether or not they are prepared to fight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the past 50 years the international community has created numerous covenants and instruments to express a range of rights, privileges and responsibilities which have come to be regarded as essential for the pursuit of normal and fruitful relations within societies and in the international community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These covenants have contributed enormously to peoples' sense of their place in society&mdash;people are more aware of their role as shapers of their society. In western societies like Australia, people have come to the realisation that citizenship requires more than following the herd.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People have come to realise that the onus of decision-making rests with them in so many areas of life. The ballot box is not the only point at which people express their thoughts on national directions and issues. Recent history has shown that Australians do not unquestioningly accept governments' views on a range of issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this environment it makes no sense to suggest that people cannot and will not make up their own minds, based on the dictates of conscience, about the rights or wrongs of war and individual acts of war.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, if life is a fundamental human right, then we must accord each person the right to choose which circumstances will induce them to place their life on the line for their country or any other cause.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government, having recognised these issues in relation to conscripts, cannot now claim that those who are members of the Australian Defence Forces are endowed with less humanity, less ability to weigh up the morality of certain wars, or that they should be accorded less rights than potential conscripts. It is ultimately beyond the power of any government or military authority to force a person to fight; it is a mark of a civilised and mature society that it will not place an individual or a military authority in a position in which the individual will feel compelled to take unlawful measures to follow the dictates of their conscience.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In passing this legislation, the Parliament would be indicating that Australia is a mature nation, that it takes its place in the international community with a sense of self-assurance and pride in its people. It would be saying that we have shaped, and are shaping our national values on the basis of mature reflection on our place in the world, and not on some jingoistic browbeating of those to whom we would look in time of conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill asserts the fundamental right of members of Australia's armed forces to make their own decisions about those situations in which they are prepared to put their lives at risk.</PARA>

On page 7 the Committee notes that the President informed the Committee that there would be a wider review of protective security at Parliament House, which had commenced at the time the report was put together. Could the President be kind enough to advise the Committee when that is likely to be completed now that there has been some opportunity to make some headway on it?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator O'Chee would probably be aware, the ANOA recommended the creation of an interdepartmental committee on which all parties with a role in the security of the parliamentary precincts would be represented. That body was set up. The Speaker and I established the Presiding Officers Advisory Group on Security chaired by the Security Controller and comprising representatives of each of the parliamentary departments, the Department of Administrative Services, Australian Protective Service and the Australian Federal Police. That advisory group is to report to us on protective security issues which extend beyond the responsibilities of the individual departments which may impact on security arrangements affecting the precincts as a whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 14 October, following our consideration of the assessment of the security risks, threats and vulnerabilities, the Speaker and I directed the Security Controller, in consultation with the Usher of the Black Rod and the Sergeant-at-Arms, to prepare papers which listed the identified threats, vulnerabilities and risks and suggested means to deal with them, including cost estimates, and which dealt with the difficulties which have arisen in having the Australian Protective Service involved in the security of Parliament House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the President for his answer. My concern remains. As I expressed during the Committee hearings, we seem to have a very large number of APS officers costing an awful lot of money who are really responsible only for the security on one side of the building. We have attendants in the rest of the building but they are not armed in the same fashion as are APS officers. Clearly, there are two levels of security within the building. It may be that it is rightfully seen that there are two different levels of risk. But I think the incident in question with the four-wheel drive vehicle and also other incidents would demonstrate the fact that the risk is not perhaps as easily delineated as has previously been the case. Have discussions already addressed the role of the APS and whether a more uniform security arrangement can be applied to the building?</PARA></TALK.START>

As I said, one of the main parts of the report is to deal with the difficulties that have arisen in having the Australian Protective Service involved in the security of Parliament House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My concern still remains the fact that we are paying a lot of money for the APS officers. I cannot remember the exact figure off the top of my head but it is quite substantial. We did not seem to be getting what I would consider to be terribly good value for money from the relevant department in terms of the amount of money that the Senate or the Joint House Department was forking out for this. I think this is one of the areas that we need to look at as well. If the assessment is made that we are going to have APS officers, I think the Committee would have to be satisfied that we are getting value for money out of those officers. During the hearings, it certainly did not seem to be the case that for the enormous amounts of money being expended we were getting the appropriate number of officers on the deck at any one period.</PARA></TALK.START>

From all those things I thought we had concluded from reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that Mr Curtis was to have nothing to do with that report at all.

<PARA>I had asked the question why an announcement was not made to clear the building. Mr Curtis continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had spoken to the offender, Moss, shortly after the incident; ascertained from him that there was a firearm in the vehicle; questioned him as to whether there were explosives in the vehicle; satisfied the advice that he provided me that there was only a single firearm and some ammunition in the vehicle.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, I go back to the proposition that the entire building and people in it were placed at risk because Mr Curtis decided he believed Mr Moss, who was the man who had broken into this building with a firearm on board. Mr Curtis went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evacuation continued simply as a precautionary measure, I guess to eliminate the risk of his not having provided me with the correct information and there being some form of incendiary device contained in the vehicle.</PARA>

The fact of the matter is that there is provision in this building to have it evacuated in a proper and systematic way. If that is not the case, we should hear about that as well.

I understand that some of the printing is able to be contracted out because it comes from another section&mdash;administration, or whatever&mdash;and that offsets the difficulty of the increase in wages. Life is always more simple for me if I can see the figures as they really are, and not what clever bookkeeping does for us.

I refer to correspondence between me and the Mr President, and specifically to his response, which was stimulated by some deliberate questions I asked of the Clerk at the meeting of the Appropriations and Staffing Committee relating to the circumstances in respect of part time staff. The Clerk informed the Committee, in what I thought was a very logical way, that part time staff would be provided to committees where it was desirable, on the part of the Committee, and where it best served the interests of the Committee. He did not say that we would have imposed on committees some bureaucratic system whereby, because the Public Service had decided it would have part time staff, the committees would have to wear them. I was quite deliberate on that in a number of questions I asked and I was assured that such staff would be provided only where it was compatible with efficiency for the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last remarks were somewhat gratuitous. My understanding, and I do not think it is different from the one we had when we discussed it at the Committee, is that there are important functions for the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet in coordinating the development of ESD. That involves more than matters that are solely the responsibility of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories. A number of agencies are involved. Therefore, there is an important coordinating function.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would be some concern if any of the agencies with a particular brief&mdash;DASET, Primary Industries and Energy, whichever it were&mdash;were to chair the group because it might be felt that it indicated a lack of balance between the competing interests. There is also an influence on the level and intensity of involvement of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet in any issue, including this issue, depending upon whether it is likely to come to Cabinet and therefore involve the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in that capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Individual policies and programs within the ESD strategy rest with the portfolio Minister and his or her Department. In this instance, the responsibility for this area rests with the portfolio Minister for DASET and her Department. That is why it is dealt with by it. There is a broader coordinating function, which is the responsibility of PM and C. In this instance, they are individual legislative matters. But other policy matters come up which may be the responsibility of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories or some other Minister. They deal with those. We are not doing it twice, nor is PM and C, but there is an overall framework within which those individual activities are undertaken. </PARA>

It may be that another Department would be involved with regard to a particular aspect of an issue, but I understand that those are the core departments that are primarily coordinated within this process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McMullan said that the carriage of the wet tropics management legislation is now being handled solely by the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories. I assume, therefore, that that means that Minister Kelly is the Minister who is happy at a Commonwealth level for the Wet Tropics Management Authority to be delegated power under the Bill to deal on its own behalf with foreign organisations and bodies. Is that what Senator McMullan is telling me, or was not anybody else in Cabinet advised about the fact that the Wet Tropics Management Authority Bill proposes to give to the Wet Tropics Management Authority the power to deal, negotiate and liaise with foreign organisations and foreign bodies?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A reasonable construction of that Bill would have one believe that the Wet Tropics Management Authority can go off and do whatever it wants and make its own arrangements, for example, with the United Nations environment program. Under the construction of that Bill, it is not unreasonable to say that the Wet Tropics Management Authority could attend in its own right an earth summit, if we were to have another such summit. It has the power to deal, negotiate and liaise in its own right with foreign organisations and bodies. Perhaps Senator McMullan could elucidate as to which Department was advised of this and who approved that from the Commonwealth point of view?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a matter that has anything to do with the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet Estimates, because it was not a matter dealt with by PM and C. I am not even sure whether people in the appropriate department would share Senator O'Chee's interpretation of the legislation. That is for others to be concerned about.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With due respect to Senator McMullan, it is a very important matter because this is the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. This is the Department which arguably is the premier Department within Cabinet. Its role is to advise the Prime Minister. One would certainly believe that the people who are advising the Prime Minister would want to know that this Bill extends to the Wet Tropics Management Authority's external affairs powers that are the prerogative of the Commonwealth. If that would not concern the Prime Minister, I do not know what would.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, according to Senator McMullan, it has nothing to do with the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and we are to leave it in the hands of Minister Kelly. We have already seen what an abominable job Minister Kelly does when she tramps around the world stage. We are now to see a further derogation of those powers into the hands of the Minister for the Environment. If this is what Senator McMullan wants us to accept, I am afraid that he is asking us to accept the unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has to be some clear control exercised over this whole matter. Whilst it may be very good and proper in principle to talk about these things, necessary constraints must be placed on these bodies. I do not care whether Dr Hitchcock or somebody else heads the Wet Tropics Management Authority, but the general view of many people in the area affected&mdash;and I know that Mrs Kelly is not in the area affected&mdash;is that they do not want the Wet Tropics Management Authority to have unfettered power to deal with foreign bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is wholly unacceptable to have a body that can run rampant over the local authorities, because there is no responsibility on the Wet Tropics Management Authority to liaise with local councils. It can go off and do whatever deal it wants with whatever foreign organisation or body that it sees fit to deal with. That is unacceptable. I ask Senator McMullan why this has not been brought to the attention of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Why has it been given wholly into the realm of Minister Kelly, whom we have already seen is totally inadequate when it comes to dealing with these issues at an international level?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a little disturbed that Senator McMullan might consider those comments rude. If I want to be rude, I have not even started about Minister Kelly. I was merely repeating a comment which is made by many people in relation to her lamentable performance over the earth summit and her even more lamentable performance over the educational pack that was sent out to schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind this Committee that Minister Kelly not only endorsed the schools environment pack but also made sure her photograph was on it. However, when the flak came back about what an outrageous, lopsided and ill-informed document it was, she said she did not even know what was in it and her Department approved it all. These are not rude comments about Minister Kelly. Unfortunately they are very apposite comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What particularly concerns me is the fact that Senator McMullan refuses to say whether the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was advised of any of these consequences of the Bill. If the Commonwealth is going to foot half of the cost of the Wet Tropics Management Authority&mdash;and it would not be inappropriate to talk about the enormous cost of that body&mdash;then I believe there ought to be some decent restraint and supervision imposed over the body, particularly when there are these extensions of the power of the Wet Tropics Management Authority that one could arguably see as encroaching upon the external affairs powers of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are pumping something in the vicinity of $8m or more into the Wet Tropics Management Authority every year and there is great dissatisfaction amongst the people in the affected areas as to exactly what they get for their money. Almost half of that money is taken up in corporate support and over half of the money is corporate support and public relations put together. Very little money seems to actually go into worthwhile projects on the ground. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that a number of the issues that are currently being addressed in the area of Northern Australia will now take their genesis from two reports. I would hesitate to say `important' reports, because of the quality of the documents that have recently been produced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One was a document prepared by the Centre for Applied Economic Research and Analysis earlier this year, which drew largely on the work of Professor Percy Harris from the James Cook University. That report was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Australian Economic Development Strategy</EMPHASIS>. In the last month or so the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has released an interim report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">North Australia Social Justice Strategy</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the preparation for the Northern Australia economic development strategy really did concentrate on three main areas that do impact in Northern Australia; firstly, the changes in the volume of economic activity; secondly, the changes in the level of living in the communities; and, thirdly, the changes in productive efficiency. However, the economic development report really only addressed the changes in the volume of economic activity or the growth over time in the area which we generally call Northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must express some profound disappointment and concern about the later report, the interim report on a social justice strategy. This document was recently released by the Minister for Northern Australia, Mr Ben Humphreys, and is of some 40-odd pages. I really do question what will form the basis for the subsequent report that is alluded to in the interim report itself, and in what we would come to consider to be the activity that would flow from this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My reason for saying that is found on page 7 of the interim report where it states that it is acknowledged that the North Australia social justice strategy has an aim to achieve better services for Northern Australia. It goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Strategy has four related components, each vital to achieving the Government's overall aim. These components are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1.Improving consultation with communities to identify problems and take account of community suggestions for improvements in services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">2.Better planning, design and delivery of services to enable better matching of services to needs in North Australia, to make mainstream Commonwealth programs more adaptable to local circumstances, and to develop specifically targeted programs for exceptional locations or needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">3.Improving information about what services are available and how to access them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">4.Developing foundations for the future, including finding more efficient and effective ways to provide services.</PARA>
<PARA>These are strong, pious but cobbled together words which talk about nothing more than consultation, planning, information and a future dream. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is my major criticism of this entire report. All it is is a cobbling together of programs that are, should be and could be very properly performed by all of the various arms of functional government, no matter what political persuasion or no matter where. I find that there is no real emphasis on goals or strategies in the area of social justice. There is no statement even of this Government's philosophic commitment as to what it sees as social justice that we hear so much about in this particular report. The report does not go into any constructive or viable ways in which the Commonwealth will work with the State or Northern Territory Government to achieve what the Labor Government so often prides itself on achieving in the area of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that Senator McMullan will be aware that during the Estimates process I asked a number of questions of all of the functional departments as they operate in Northern Australia for the details of their consultancies. It is very interesting to look at the consultancies that were given in the current financial year by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet portfolio. Over a quarter of a million dollars worth of consultancies were given and what do they achieve?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first one was from the Office of the Status of Women, which was a report on implementing the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women, particularly as it applied to the Northern Territory. The cost of that was $2,500. From the Aboriginal Reconciliation Unit to the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association there was a $45,000 consultancy to inform Aboriginal media, and through them the Aboriginal and Torres Strait communities, about the reconciliation process. That is already going on and is well known. That report cost $45,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the Office of Multicultural Affairs there was a consultancy of $10,660 and the subject was the representation of cultural diversity in the media. In addition, there was a $2,800 consultancy for group discussions with people of non-English speaking backgrounds to determine the extent of the participant's experience of and views on access to Commonwealth services and programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An amount of $155,510 is allocated to the Centre for Applied Economic Research and Analysis to study the economy of northern Australia and to prepare the economic strategy options for developing policies in the development of northern Australia. As we know, that report came down well before this Budget, yet nothing can be identified as having properly flowed from that economic strategy into this year's Budget. Also, from the Office of Northern Development, $23,524 is paid to the Australian Science and Technology Council for the development of a north Australian research compendium. But then of course one goes into that body itself, the Australian Science and Technology Council, and finds that there is an additional $30,000 for the development of this compendium. So there is a total cost of some $53,000 odd dollars for further research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Labor Government is good at research. It is good at passing out consultancies to its mates all throughout Australia and keeping academics and various people writing reports. This can be seen in any department&mdash;the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the minerals area, the CSIRO, the whole lot of them. During the Estimates, I will be producing a document which sets out every single one of the consultancies produced by every Federal department as it applies to the Northern Territory. It will be a staggering document and it will be an indictment that none of the results of all of those reports&mdash;whether they be on national parks and wildlife services or on the environment&mdash;end up being commented on in an interim report on social justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought social justice was about jobs, about employment of people in the community. As I said earlier, in this report on social justice there is no acknowledgment that the underlying principles of social justice depend almost entirely on the provision of employment. Instead, one gets the impression from reading this that northern Australia is an underprivileged or Third World country. That is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no linkage between the two reports, namely, the social justice strategy and the economic development strategy which was brought down earlier in the year. In the March Estimates I asked a question of the head of the Office of Northern Development, Mr Gray:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is the coordination between the social justice strategy and the economic strategy?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Gray's response then was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coordination is in the form of the secretariat having had discussions with those who are conducting the economic strategy at James Cook University. There is clearly going to be reference in the economic strategy to those schemes, if you like, or those processes which will impact upon economic development in the north so far as the various services provided by government agencies impact upon it. There is communication and consultation between the two groups who have the responsibility for putting those two strategies together.</PARA>
<PARA>Fine pious words in March, but where are they now? Why is it not commented on in the interim report? Where is the coordination? There is no drawing together of the two in any way that would properly sustain a community in northern Australia. It makes me mad that this Government is running around throwing out millions of dollars of largesse in consultancies and economic studies, but not on the programs that will assist people living in remote parts of Australia or in the northern part of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important also to look at a number of the areas where we would expect the various departments to pull together. I find this interim report of the social justice strategy to be so transparent in that it is obviously written by someone who is used to doing academic reports for universities or someone else. The only new jobs I can see being created through it are going to be in the production of more reports in more areas. Whether it is the Department of Industrial Relations and ATSIC combining to fund a half a million dollar establishment and first year operational costs of a national Aboriginal employer association, why has there not been a cooperation of bringing the Aboriginal people and the general community together in the employment agencies that already exist?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a $36m allocation over the next four years to supplement the phased implementation of award coverage to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations funded wholly or partly by ATSIC. The report goes on and on in these particular areas. I would comment that the consultancy list from DEET is not yet in; the full list from ATSIC is not yet in for these considerations; the consultancy lists from the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council are not yet in. I am wondering why so many of the departments have not yet been able to respond. They are not alluded to in the social justice report, yet I know that the Government has missed hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, we get the pious words that would come out of various departments such as the Aboriginal student and parent awareness program, the national Aboriginal health strategy, the community-controlled health services, the community agents program, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander interpreter service, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander liaison officers, the rural affairs workshops, the rural health alliance, and the community relations program in the office of local government. The only jobs coming from this report are for these people to do more consulting and more gathering of information and not job creation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would point out that if anyone turns to Fightback and looks at the policy announcements that a number of us have made, he will see that our policies are all determined on eliminating taxes and on boosting the economy of the north with particular benefits for the families that live there, permitting the full potential of our vast resources to be developed and value added industries to be realised. Fightback also outlines the benefit for workers in northern Australia and the ensuring of full statehood of the Northern Territory as part of constitutional development processes. There is no mention of any of that in any of these reports from this Department. Is it any wonder that people in the north have lost confidence in the Labor Government?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, why is the final consideration of the social justice strategy by this Labor Government not proposed until after the next Federal election? I would have thought that, particularly prior to an election, a Labor administration would have wanted to consider and would normally have been considering many of the appropriate goals and strategies of social justice on which I have commented and which I believe are so deficient in this particular report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So really it is a question of why the social justice strategy football has been kicked well into 1993 where it will not be an issue until after the next election and probably will never be implemented by a Labor administration, but it is also a question of why none of the initiatives flagged in the various studies on economics was addressed in this year's Budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am concerned at Senator McMullan's answers because these issues were all raised here in the Senate in the Estimates committees. I refer in particular to the consideration that took place on 27 March 1992. I would have thought that in the preparation of this interim report the issues and the timetabling would have been well and truly flagged, and therefore the various issues should have been addressed in the Budget context. Certainly by now, 9 November, quite some considerable time has passed in which many of the discussions should have taken place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that towards the end of the interim report there is basically a regurgitation of all of the programs of other departments and agencies, such as Telecom, Australia Post and various broadcasting areas. They are put forward as if they were major initiatives of the Government. But, of course, each and every one of the programs identified in that report had been flagged to Government in previous years' Budget considerations. There is nothing new in anything that is stated in this social justice strategy. It is merely a cobbling together of programs that the Government has been considering, has been funding, and has been carrying out for a number of years. There are no new orders of priority, there are no goals, there are no strategies, there are no reassessments that are so necessary in these particular areas if in fact social justice is to be addressed as having a priority in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the considerations of the economic development strategy were well known back before March. In fact, I believe that I raised these in the Estimates late last year and, therefore, I was looking in the context of the August Budget for some deliberate statement. Senator Collins had previously been appointed the Minister assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia, a position which has now been inherited, as part of the necessary government changes, by Mr Humphreys. But I would have thought that the fact that Senator Collins is also from northern Australia would have put more priority on and initiated more concern in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, very obviously, the Government has looked at the marginal seat strategy and I think has presumed that, because the seats of Kalgoorlie, Grey, the Northern Territory and Kennedy are all currently held by Labor, it really did not have to address any major new initiatives in those four or five principal northern seats. Let me tell you, Madam Temporary Chairman, I think those seats will be well worth watching at the Federal election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator O'Chee and I were both present when this discussion took place. We have both read pages 85 and 86 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. But they seem to be saying quite different things. Mr Gray, when talking about remote education at James Cook University, said that he did not want to identify where any specific unit fits in. He said that it clearly has a source of knowledge and data which would be useful. He went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would see them, as we would indeed see other institutions and units across northern Australia, as a source of competent data upon which to assist the Government in coming to certain policy conclusions.</PARA>
<PARA>I could say that about a number of academic institutions in Australia with which I have had no discussions at all. I know that they carry out work which could be useful in such an area. It would be very strange to say otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When specifically asked whether he had had any discussions, he said that he had not and that he was going to check whether anyone else had. I do not think I have seen Senator O'Chee's reservations. He is making an interpretation of the words which does not seem to me to fit. I was there but I did not get the impression that he has.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My concern is this: the Committee was told that the unit had done very valuable work. Yet, not only had Mr Gray not contacted it but nobody had contacted it. How the Office of Northern Development can draw the conclusion that the unit does very valuable work when nobody in the Office had contacted it is a very different question to whether Mr Gray personally had contacted it. It just so happens that Mr Gray was right&mdash;it had done very valuable work. But, of course, there is a problem. Here is Mr Gray saying that the remote education unit at James Cook University&mdash;Dr McSwan and his team&mdash;has done very valuable work, yet the Government is refusing to give it adequate funding to continue that work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you, Madam Temporary Chairman, very well know, one of the greatest problems facing people in rural areas is getting decent education for their children. We are not talking about whether they can get to the library. We are not talking about whether they can do science experiments. We are talking about basic education that people in city areas take for granted. An example of this is being taught to read and write by a competent teacher. You know, as I know, Madam Temporary Chairman, that in many rural areas of Queensland, in many areas of northern Queensland&mdash;for example, the peninsula and areas in the direction of Mount Isa and Camooweal and further south&mdash;there are massive educational problems. With all the best will in the world, unless parents are adequately backed up they can never give a standard of education remotely approaching the standard of education that these children could get if they had a proper teacher. The necessity, therefore, is to ensure that those parents get adequate support and that the educational programs that are in place are educational programs that give equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Equity' is a word which this Government likes to bandy around quite a lot. The Government likes to talk about equity. It likes to talk about access and equity&mdash;about access to education and about equitable educational outcomes. We have a government that talks about social justice for northern Australia; a government that talks about access and equity in education. Yet what does it do? It refuses to give decent funding to this unit at James Cook University&mdash;the only unit in Australia that really researches this topic in particular; the only unit that can really provide the answers to the educational issues that people in remote areas have to battle with every day. What is more disturbing is that there has been no contact, no discussions and no work with the unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, not only are the people in remote and rural Australia crying out for somebody to address their educational needs but the people with the answers are crying out for the opportunity to talk to the Government. And all the while, as Senator Tambling has so ably said, the Government throws money willy-nilly all over the place. We are even paying for research into what research has been done. The Government is sitting on its hands although there are people who can help deliver the answers to the social problems facing people in remote and rural Australia. </PARA>

I conclude by saying that I would hope when we come to the Supplementary Estimates this matter might have been addressed in more detail. I hope that the Office of Northern Development might have had some detailed discussions with the remote education unit at James Cook University with a view to actually working alongside the unit and developing with it some comprehensive answers to those questions about equitable educational outcomes and equitable educational opportunities for people in northern Australia and for people in remote and rural Australia generally. I know that this is a burning question. I would hope that that would be done as soon as possible.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take the opportunity to note that again members of the Estimates Committee were perturbed at the enormous amount of money that is going into the Office of Multicultural Affairs. Some of us have said before, and I am quite happy to say it again, that we consider the Office of Multicultural Affairs to be somewhat superfluous, given that many of the tasks that it performs are in fact performed by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the real root of the existence of the Office of Multicultural Affairs lies in the fact that it was very political. Our previous Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, came from a seat that had a very high, shall we say, ethnic component. I do not think it would be unfair to say that the Office of Multicultural Affairs was a very convenient way to be seen to be doing something in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Bishop, Senator Tambling and I have pointed out, the Office of Multicultural Affairs has continued to offer large grants and consultancies. I do not wish to say any more than this: we believe that in a time of incredible hardship such as this the Government must trim back its spending. We must not forget that this year this Government will spend $13,400m that it does not have. We feel it is appropriate that the Government constrain its spending wherever possible so as to reduce that. When one looks at some of the spending that has been going on and some of the grants that have been made by this Department and other departments on so-called ethnic issues, one really does get very perturbed at how the Commonwealth is spending money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We found something in excess of $30,000 given to trade union groups in Western Australia to run multicultural talkback radio programs about the benefits of union membership; $18,000 was given to another group of people to put together multicultural audio tapes on award restructuring and the benefits of belonging to a union. I actually took the time to listen to the audio tape, and every 20 or 30 seconds there was another plug for members of the Vietnamese community to join the union and to participate in the activities of the union and get politically involved. This is the sort of outrageous spending that is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of what some people describe as the ethnic community, I can say that many people in the ethnic community do not agree with the way this money is being spent and that many people in the ethnic community can see far better ways of allocating the Government's largess, if largess must be allocated at all. I would hope, speaking for myself, that very rapidly this Department will be truly superfluous. I think some 18 months or two years ago I asked officers of the Department what their prime objective was, and they said it was to have a more harmonious community where ethnic differences did not matter. I said to them, `When are you going to make yourselves redundant?'. It is interesting to note that they have not made themselves redundant yet. They are still spending the money. But, if the goals of the Office of Multicultural Affairs are truly to create a more harmonious Australian society, then one of the steps to that must be to make themselves redundant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it gives people a nice, warm inner glow, we could do a lot to cut back spending and waste. Ultimately, I believe that it does make a more harmonious community, because I know there are many people who are resentful at money that they see to be thrown at this ethnic group or that ethnic group. In a time of recession this creates ethnic tension and differences. That is something that I do not want to see in this country. I do not want to see a return to some of the racist attitudes of the Cold War years. But, if the Government continues to throw money around like this, and is being seen to throw money around like this, of course that will be the only consequence. </PARA>

It is appropriate that government should seek to provide to those people access to the same sort of information&mdash;as far as we can&mdash;and the same level of information, assistance and support that the rest of Australia takes for granted with regard to information and support that will facilitate them participating in society on the same basis and with the same capacity to be as effective as other elements in our society, including those from the more mainstream culture. </PARA>

When I discussed this with a number of people, since the hearing, most of them were shocked that we would try to establish a textile industry in the Kimberley desert when the textile industry in places much closer to our population centres is dying at a great rate of knots.

The real problem with that is that for the preceding years, the Parliament has been misled because we were led to believe that Mr Mountford was a regular paid employee under the normal terms and condition of a Commonwealth employee. The curious statement was made that it was thought he was not somehow a consultant. Then suddenly there was a change of mind and it was discovered this year that he was a consultant. This really shows that the Senate Committee was misled. No good reason has been provided as to why the report was made in the way it was for a number of years and then was suddenly changed.

It was then decided to err, as I said, on the side of caution and that was why the Mountford consultancy was included in the 1991-92 annual report. While the AMC is not required to seek approval from the Department for its consultancy proposals, the Department does in a technical sense process these contracts. </PARA>

There is no good reason why Mr Mountford is a consultant. There is no good reason why Mr Mountford ought not be simply a regular employee like anybody else within the Minister's Department. What is it that is so special about Mr Mountford that delineates him from anything else?

Mr Mountford was re-engaged in 1989 and 1991. Each of those contracts was for a period of one year and, as I have said, by implication, should have been listed in the Department's annual report.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak this evening on two matters which are of great importance to my constituents in Queensland. I do not expect to keep the Senate very long. The two matters are very closely interrelated and are constantly raised by many in the community. The first is the issue of truth in labelling with regard to Australian made produce, and the second is that we should encourage all Australians to buy Australian made produce.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people shop at locally owned businesses, they are not only creating employment, they are also saving that business from going to the wall. Buying locally also helps to protect against higher prices in the future. We all remember that 20 years ago every town had one or two bakers, several butchers, a soft drink factory and several greengrocers, but now there are few, if any, left. People used to be able to buy their flour, meat, sugar and produce from several suppliers, but now the supply is limited to one or two companies and this has obviously affected the buying price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big supermarket chains have used a lot of imported goods and this has, in turn, closed the small shops and small manufacturers who employed a lot of people. Regrettably, those people are now on the dole. However, I must say that just recently there has been talk about how the supermarkets are trying to ensure that so many more of their goods are Australian-made and not imported. The supermarket chains control the manufacturers and the farmers, and if they do not sell at their price, they just import the goods. At the moment, four in every five sales are made in a chain-store. When five out of five are made in chain-stores, what will people be paying then?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trend is plain for everyone to see. In 10 years time, there will be no fruit and vegetable market in Brisbane, only a handful of big buyers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator O'Chee is right. It is a very important industry in our Kingaroy district. The Kingaroy Toasted Peanuts Co. also tries to promote our local products. Indeed, it uses all Australian grown peanuts, except for its supply of cashews, which are not available in Australia. The company tries to clearly mark its products with an Australian flag on the front of the packets, and `Made in Australia from Australian peanuts' and the Peanut Marketing Board logo.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are so many labels on items today that are deceptive. I believe that people are prepared to pay a premium for a good Australian product if they have to. The campaign by farmers and consumers for truth in labelling deserves the support of everyone. For too long, people have been importing junk from overseas and getting away with putting a `Produce of Australia' label on it. A letter to the editor in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">South Burnett Times</EMPHASIS> put it simply when the writer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a great deal that Labor governments in Brisbane and Canberra could do to stop this attack on our jobs and our health.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The blame rests squarely on the shoulders of Wayne Goss and Paul Keating.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I would like to make mention of the decision by Coles and Woolworths to make it easier to identify Australian made products on store shelves. However, for the strategy to work there would need to be an urgent overhaul of Australia's food labelling laws to allow imported products to be clearly recognisable. The Queensland Grain Growers Association has led the truth in labelling debate for almost three years, with the association's stated policy being that imported food stuffs should carry large, visually dominant labels indicating that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many cases, consumers simply cannot determine whether they are really buying Australian product or not, as enough flexibility exists in current food labelling laws to allow importers to imply that their product was made in Australia. The laws are obviously inadequate when one can read on the front of food packets that the product contained within is Australian, yet when one turns it over, one finds it is actually made or grown overseas and merely packed or processed here. Surveys by Coles and Woolworths have clearly shown that shoppers are willing to purchase a genuinely Australian made product, even if it is more expensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as tightening up labelling laws, there is an urgent need for industry to take commercial action to protect itself from dumped and cheap imports. In the midst of the crisis currently hitting our rural community, Australia is importing more than $2 billion worth of food products every year. That is a tremendous amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian horticultural products are fast becoming an endangered species. The list is growing every week. First it was pineapples; now it is bananas, canned fruit, peanuts, navy beans, peas, beetroot, beans, potatoes and other vegetables, as well as apricots, dried vine fruits, rice, orange juice, apple juice, jams, mushrooms, dairy products and fresh meat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One industry which is still suffering from dumped goods is the peanut industry. That is an industry that I know very well because many growers in my home district are centred on Kingaroy. This Federal Government has failed in its duty to protect Australia's peanut producers by rejecting a peanut industry application seeking the imposition of anti-dumping duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The peanut industry has been suffering from an influx of dumped overseas peanuts over the past three years, but the peanut industry has not been able to convince the Anti-Dumping Authority of its plight. In February this year I moved a motion condemning the Government for its refusal to implement anti-dumping and countervailing measures against the dumping of Chinese peanuts on the Australian market. Unfortunately, the Chinese peanuts have residue in them. That is one of the sad things that happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Australian Customs inquiry into the importation of the Chinese peanuts established that these imports have increased 300 per cent in the past three years. It admitted that the cheaper imports were being dumped and that Australian producers were suffering as a result. It also admitted that these actions were having a serious impact on Queensland's $30m a year peanut industry. If it does not rain soon in the Kingaroy district, no peanuts will be planted so that we can have a really good year with our peanuts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot blame Wayne Goss for that. I can blame him for a lot of other things, but not that. Furthermore, tests on the Chinese peanuts have identified high levels of chemical residues which are illegal in the Australian industry. The thing that annoys me very much is that some of these imported Chinese peanuts are being mixed with good Australian peanuts by some firms which then try to promote them as being totally Australian peanuts, which is very wrong. The Minister who looks after Customs and the Government should take immediate action to halt the importation of these peanuts and thus provide a fair go for Australian peanut farmers instead of supporting those who live in China.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, a whole smorgasbord of imported food is entering our market as subsidised products. At the same time very often our farmers have to plough their products back into the soil. This problem is not just one for farmers. I can understand housewives who, under current economic circumstances, try to buy the cheapest products when shopping. And who can blame them when we have seen our household income seriously eroded since this Government came to power? Many of those households now face life on the dole as unemployment rises steadily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, any sensible shopper tries to cut costs by buying cheaper brands but with many of these dumped brands the products are not as tasty nor as nutritious as Australian grown fruit and vegetables. Many housewives would know that Australian grown and processed products guarantee the best quality in the world. When I go home at the weekend between the sittings of the Senate and do my shopping I certainly like to buy Australian products. I also like to buy them a bit cheaper if I can but it does not always work, of course. Our goods are grown under strict guidelines and processed under high standards of hygiene using the best and most advanced technology available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is not only the farmers who suffer from these dumped products. Almost every part of the Australian community, both in the city and the country, is affected. There is an entire support network servicing these farmers and their products which is also affected. I am talking about the rural communities&mdash;the transport workers, the processors, the cannery workers, the packers, the storemen, the factory workers and, of course, in the end all Australian consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is bad enough that Australian farmers are suffering because of the irresponsible policies of this Government and then having to compete in a corrupt and dishonest world trading market, but dumped products add another dimension to the problems of the rural industries. It means that farmers are having to compete on their home turf with inferior products which are deliberately dumped onto our domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I urge all Australian shopkeepers, housewives and legislators to look closely at this growing problem and help our own industry by buying Australian-made products. </PARA>

I share with her a concern that Australian consumers do get imports of genuine quality and are not put at risk by imports. I also share her concern that we not be dumped on. I ask her to note that all she says is really meaningless when one looks at the approach that her coalition leader, Dr Hewson, has embodied in his Fightback package.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The estimate was derived from a combination of firstly, existing office accommodation that was partly or wholly vacant as at August 1991 or expected to become vacant over the next two years and, secondly, from new office buildings under construction and expected to be completed over the ensuing two years that had not been fully committed at that point in time.
