<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is an Omnibus Bill containing minor administrative amendments to the following legislation administered within the Primary Industries and Energy Portfolio, the Meat Inspection Act 1983; the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act 1978; the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967; and the Wheat Marketing Act 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Meat Inspection Act 1983</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to this Act provide for the definition of `authorised officer' to limit the number of such officers to only those people appointed by the Secretary. Currently the definition of authorised officer extends to all officers within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy in addition to those appointed by the Secretary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the formation of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy in 1987, such a wide definition has not been altogether necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amended definition will be the same as that which exists for authorised officer in the Export Control Act 1982. The Secretary will continue to have the power to appoint people outside the Department to be authorised officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly the Bill makes the Act consistent with current criminal law policy of omitting references to monetary penalties where terms of imprisonment are provided for. The provisions of Section 4B of the Crimes Act 1914 will apply. For each 12 months of imprisonment provided for in the Meat Inspection Act 1983 as the maximum penalty, a court may impose a monetary penalty of up to $6,000 instead of or in addition to the imprisonment penalty for individuals, or 5 times that amount for corporations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This obviates the need to amend the Meat Inspection Act 1983 when policy as to the relativity between imprisonment penalties and monetary penalties changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where an offence carries a monetary penalty only, the maximum penalty is increased by the Bill to more closely correlate with the original real value of the maximum penalty for the offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also amends the regulation making power to beyond doubt the power to make regulations for the remission of fees paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also incorporates into the Meat Inspection Act 1983 a new offence of authorised officers receiving goods or services from the owner of a prescribed premises without the written approval of the Secretary. This offence was introduced into the Export Control Act 1982 in 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 35 of the Meat Inspection Act 1983 currently prohibits the owner of a prescribed premises from providing goods or services to an authorised officer. This amendment complements that provision by prohibiting the receipt of goods or services by authorised officers. Domestic meat inspection legislation must demonstrate the importance of integrity of inspection staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act 1978</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to this Act are designed to improve the efficiency of its administration in three respects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first amendment transfers responsibility for determining the form of audited financial statements required under the Act, from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. This will simplify administration of assistance programs under this Act, as all requirements of the Act would become the responsibility of one Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will also bring administration of programs under this Act into line with similar assistance programs administered by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second amendment permits acquittal of program expenditures by the senior executive officer of the State organisation or approved body receiving Commonwealth funds. Currently acquittal can only be made by the State Auditors-General. This will expedite acquittal of program expenditures and recognises the independence of State Auditors-General.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third amendment makes the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory eligible to receive assistance under the Act. When the Act was drafted the Territories were administered by the Commonwealth, but now they are self-governing. It is important they again have the same eligibility for funding as the States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment extends section 8H of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 to enable delegation of routine Joint Authority powers under subsidiary Acts like the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Registration Fees) Act 1967 and the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Royalty) Act 1967. It corrects a drafting oversight in the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Act 1991 and maximises the potential gains resulting from the streamlining of administration under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Wheat Marketing Act 1989</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment will extend by two months, to 1 September, the date by which the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) is required to submit its Corporate Plan to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy for approval. This change will more closely align the development of this Plan with the AWB's financial year, which commences on 1 October. The amendments will also provide for the preparation of Annual Operational Plans, based on the Corporate Plan, by 1 October, again better reflecting the AWB's budgetary cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sections concerning Ministerial approval of the AWB's Annual Operational Plans will be amended to remove the requirement for Ministerial approval of the AWB's Annual Operational Plan in line with the recommendations of the Davis Review of Commonwealth Primary Industry Statutory Marketing Authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That review considered that Ministerial approval of Annual Operating Plans conflicted with the principle of managerial autonomy, since operational plans only detail how objectives and strategies already approved in the Corporate Plan will be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This aspect of the Davis Review has already been implemented for the wool industry, in sections 35 and 36 of the Australian Wool Corporation Act 1991. The amendment therefore, will result in a requirement for the AWB's Annual Operational Plan to be submitted to the Minister for information only before the commencement of the AWB's financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">None of the proposed amendments affect Government expenditure and they will not have any staffing implications for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AMENDMENT BILL 1991 This Bill provides for amendments to the Poultry Industry Assistance Act 1965 to allow the Commonwealth to recover costs incurred in collecting and disbursing outstanding Commonwealth Hen Levies and for those costs incurred to be reimbursed from the Poultry Industry Trust Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments are part of a strategy developed in consultation with industry to wind up the Poultry Industry Trust Fund as soon as possible and then allow the repeal of the Poultry Industry Assistance Act 1965.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Hen Levy was imposed by legislation for the assistance of the egg industry through the equalisation of returns between domestic and export sales. The levy was paid into the Poultry Industry Trust Fund and distributed to the States and Territories for the assistance of the industry. The levy ceased in 1987 but the legislation continues to operate to enable the recovery of outstanding debts, the payment of debts recovered into the Fund and to permit disbursement of monies in the Fund. When any outstanding levies have been recovered, the money is to be used for the benefit of the Australian egg industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of June 1991 the Trust Fund had a balance of almost $670 000 and outstanding debts owed by eleven egg producers, all in New South Wales, amounted to $1.7 million. The majority of the debts are the subject of legal actions for recovery in New South Wales Courts and while some amounts may be irrecoverable, all possible avenues are being pursued to collect the debts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Primary Industries (Recovery of Levy Collection Expenses) Act 1988 allows the Commonwealth to recover from rural industries the cost of collecting and disbursing funds raised through levies and charges on rural production and exports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However the Primary Industries (Recovery of Levy Collection Expenses) Act 1988 did not amend the Poultry Industry Assistance Act 1965 to allow such recovery of expenses for Hen Levy collection. Previously the Commonwealth had entered into agency agreements with the States for the collection of levies and the Poultry Assistance Act 1965 allowed the Minister to make a determination for the States to be reimbursed for costs incurred from the Poultry Industry Trust Fund. Accordingly there was no provision in the Poultry Industry Assistance Act 1965 for the Commonwealth to obtain reimbursement of collection expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The New South Wales Egg Corporation, the statutory egg marketing authority in that State, signed the agency agreement with the Commonwealth. Following deregulation in the New South Wales egg industry and the termination of the Egg Corporation in October 1990, the Commonwealth assumed the responsibility of collecting all outstanding Hen Levies. While litigation proceedings are continuing for the collection of these outstanding levies, the costs of these proceedings and related expenses are incurred by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is necessary then to amend the Poultry Industry Assistance Act to ensure that the egg industry meets the same obligations as other Australian agricultural industries by paying for any costs associated with the collection and disbursement of outstanding Hen Levies from the Poultry Industry Trust Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is expected that the major costs that may have to be met by the Commonwealth in collecting Hen Levies will be court costs in the event of litigation proceedings being unsuccessful, any associated legal costs incurred by the Australian Government Solicitor's Office and any charges made by that Office for its services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will not prevent monies from the Fund being used for the existing legislative purposes of providing assistance to the industry or providing funds for research and development projects, subject to sufficient amounts being retained to cover likely levy collection costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following consultation with industry, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy determined that available Trust Fund monies be transferred to a special sub account of the Egg Industry Research and Development Fund so they can be used for the benefit of the egg industry as a whole. The sub account has been established and an initial $500 000 was transferred to it in July 1991. The monies in the sub account are to be managed conservatively by the Egg Industry Research and Development Council for specific industry purposes of producer training and economic and market research.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any levies recovered will be paid into the Trust Fund and transferred to the Egg Industry Research and Development Fund, after ensuring that sufficient funds remain in the Poultry Industry Trust Fund to meet Commonwealth collection costs. An accurate estimation of the likely costs is difficult but following consultation with the Australian Government Solicitor's Office and industry it is judged that the current balance of $180 000 will be adequate.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No.4) 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of aspects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will implement the changes initially announced in the March Industry Statement to taxation depreciation arrangements. Following consultations with business and professionals, further details of the changes to depreciation were announced on 26 September 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also introduces amendments to prevent avoidance of tax under various provisions which authorise tax deductions for capital expenditure incurred in income producing activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another amendment provides for a deferral (or "rollover") of balancing adjustments that may arise on the disposal of property to which the various capital allowance rules have applied (eg. plant depreciation or the various capital allowances for mining property).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will provide a company that is the beneficial owner of shares held by a trustee or partnership, with a rebate for its share of net income of the trust or partnership that relates to the dividends paid on those shares.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also bolster the trading stock provisions of the law by ensuring that tax deductions under section 51 for buying trading stock are not allowed until the stock is on hand. This will remedy a weakness exposed in a recent Federal Court case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will also amend the tax law to streamline the Tax File Number arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The capital gains tax rollover provisions for transfers of partnership assets to wholly-owned companies are also to be amended to correct a technical deficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other minor amendments to be given effect by this Bill relate to foreign source income measures; foreign exchange gains and losses, the rehabilitation of mining, quarrying and petroleum sites; the research and development provisions; substantiation; and the taxation of education entry payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Bill contains a number of minor technical or procedural amendments of the tax laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Depreciation amendments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will implement a number of announced changes to depreciation arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the first time, a definition of effective life will be inserted into the income tax law. Broadly, effective life will be defined as the period during which an item of plant can reasonably be expected to be used for income producing purposes by any person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This definition will facilitate the matching of depreciation deductions to the income generated by the item of plant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new effective life definition will apply to assets acquired on or after 1 July 1991. However, following representations from business groups, assets acquired after 12 March 1991 will be eligible for the new effective life rules from 1 July 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with self-assessment principles, taxpayers will be able to estimate the rate of depreciation at the time an item of plant is first used, or installed ready for use, for income producing purposes. This estimate will be based on an objective view of effective life having regard to the statutory definition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner of Taxation will continue to publish advisory depreciation rates that taxpayers not wishing to make independent estimates may adopt for convenience.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also give effect to several simplification initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The number of depreciation rates will be reduced from 18 to 7 broadbanded rate classes, effective from the 1991-92 income year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All assets eligible for broadbanding (excluding motor vehicles) will receive loading at the rate of 20 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For assets acquired on or after 1 July 1991, 100% depreciation will be allowable where the value of the unit of plant does not exceed $300 or the estimated effective life of the item is less than three years. This will reduce the large accounting task associated with small items.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also with effect from the 1991-92 income year, taxpayers will be able to pool items within a rate class for further administrative simplicity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated cost of broadbanding and 100% depreciation is $100m in 1992-3, with a declining cost in later years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Anti-avoidance Measures&mdash;Deduction Recoupment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will correct a technical deficiency in certain provisions which provide tax deductions for capital expenditure incurred in income producing activities, eg. plant depreciation allowances and allowable capital expenditure in mining operations. The amendments will prevent avoidance of tax on recoupments of previously allowed capital deductions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A common feature of the capital allowance provisions is that taxpayers are required to bring to account as income amounts received on the disposal of property that represent a recovery of deductions previously allowed. For example, under the plant depreciation rules, an assessable recoupment of deduction occurs when the  disposal proceeds of an asset exceeds its depreciated  value.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In some instances, the existing law allows taxpayers to nominate as the selling price of an asset the lesser of its market value and its tax written down value. This rule can result in tax avoidance where an asset with a high market value and a low written down value is disposed of  by a taxpayer to a related entity at the lower value. If the related entity then sells the property at its true market value, the proceeds cannot be treated as a recoupment of the previous owner's deductions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To remedy the situation, the various capital allowance recoupment rules are being amended to treat disposals of relevant property under non-arm's length arrangements, or under arrangements that involve some continuity of ownership of the property, as occurring at market value.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Balancing Adjustment Rollover Relief</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill gives effect to the then Treasurer's announcement of 8 December 1990 that wholly-owned group companies could elect to defer capital allowance balancing adjustments that would otherwise apply to intra company group asset transfers occurring after 6 December 1990 where capital gains tax rollover relief applied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A variant from the announcement is that, in respect of intra group disposals occurring after today, capital allowance balancing adjustment rollover relief will apply automatically whenever capital gains tax rollover relief is obtained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has also decided to extend capital allowance balancing adjustment rollover relief to the following kinds of asset disposals where capital gains tax rollover relief is obtained:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a disposal of an asset by an individual or trustee to a wholly-owned company;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a disposal of partnership property to a company which is wholly-owned by the partners; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a transfer of an asset to a spouse as the result of a marriage breakdown.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An optional form of balancing adjustment rollover relief will also be available for disposals of property which are taken to occur as the result of a part change in ownership of property, eg. as can occur when the membership of a partnership is varied. This will enable owners of property to avoid being unnecessarily taxed on amounts that relate to a share of property which they continue to own.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Dividend rebates: company beneficiaries and partners</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will extend the scope of the intercompany dividend rebate to allow the rebate to companies that are not shareholders. The proposed amendment will overcome the effect of the High Court decision in the Patcorp case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of this decision was that only the registered shareholder was entitled to the intercompany dividend rebate. Even though a company was absolutely entitled to the shares as against the trustee and was taxed on the dividend as trust income, it was not entitled to the rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The entitlement of the beneficial owner or partner that is a company to the rebate will be determined as if it was a shareholder and had received a dividend equal to its share of the income of the trust or partnership that relates to the dividend.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will apply to dividends paid after 17 August 1976&mdash;the day the High Court handed down the  decision in Patcorp. But the assessment of any company that was not allowed the rebate in an assessment that issued before today will not be able to have that assessment amended to allow the rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Deferral of Deductions for Prepayments of Trading Stock</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will affirm the principle of matching tax deductions for expenditure on trading stock against income from selling that stock in the appropriate tax year. This matching process is not just a principle of the tax law but is also a general accounting principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the present law, expenditure on trading stock is initially deductible under section 51 in the year in which it is incurred. To match deductions against appropriate income, section 28 then writes back as income the value of trading stock on hand at the end of the year. By this process, deductions are deferred until the stock is sold.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Court case of Federal Commissioner of Taxation versus Raymor exposed a weakness in the interaction of section 51 and section 28. In that case the taxpayer was able to achieve a tax timing advantage by prepaying the cost of certain trading stock that was not delivered, or even made, by the end of the relevant tax year. Because this particular stock was not on hand at year end, section 28 could not operate to defer the deduction allowable under section 51 for the expenditure incurred in that year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment proposed by this Bill will ensure that a deduction under section 51 for expenditure on stock is not available until the stock becomes trading stock on hand of the taxpayer. The amendment will apply to expenditure incurred after 19 December 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Tax File Number</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the amendments to the tax file number (TFN) provisions will deal with situations where a security, such as a share, is subject to a securities lending arrangement, or has been sold under certain "cum-dividend" or "cum-interest" contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also, investors in transferable investments such as shares or debentures will be required to quote their TFN by the "books closing time" for the investment if they want to avoid having 48.25% withheld from any income paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Securities dealers' "entrepot nominee companies", which are used solely to facilitate the buying and selling of securities, will be excluded from the TFN arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will also correct a technical defect in the current law by making the person liable to pay income for the trust the "investment body" for the purposes of deducting TFN amounts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will have no significant effect on the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Capital gains tax rollover relief for partnerships</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill proposes to correct a technical deficiency in the capital gains tax rollover provisions for transfers of partnership assets to companies wholly-owned by the partners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the existing law, partners can obtain inappropriately high cost bases for shares received as consideration for transfers of partnership assets encumbered by attached partnership liabilities. This can result in increased capital losses or reduced capital gains when those shares are sold.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These outcomes are unintended, and the law is to be amended to ensure that the cost bases of shares received in such circumstances reflect assumed partnership liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will prevent an unintended cost to the revenue, and will apply to disposals occurring after 6 December 1990, the application date for the CGT partnership rollover provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Taxation of Foreign Source Income</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendment of the measures for taxing foreign source income in Part Ten of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 will reduce the income of a controlled foreign company that is attributed to resident taxpayers by the amount of dividends paid by the company to unrelated parties on certain widely distributed finance shares.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment, which will relieve taxpayers from an unintended liability to tax, is to apply from the time when the foreign source income measures took effect, generally the 1990/91 income year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Foreign Exchange Gains and Losses</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill contains amendments which will ensure that the foreign exchange gains and losses provisions operate as intended. Any deductions for losses on a foreign exchange contract on capital account will be reduced by the amount of any offsetting gain on another contract if that gain is not included in assessable income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rehabilitation of Mining, Quarrying and Petroleum Sites</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will make minor amendments to the rehabilitation provisions to clarify their operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It ensures that any rehabilitation which restores a site only part way to its pre-mining condition, or which restores only part of the site, will qualify for the deduction. It will also ensure that only depreciable expenses on plant or articles are excluded from the deduction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments, which will take effect from 1 July 1991, will alleviate concerns the mining and quarrying industries held on the operation of the rehabilitation provisions. They will not have any impact on the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to the research and development provisions in relation to core technology and expenditure on plant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill proposes three minor modifications to the research and development provisions of the law, which allow accelerated deductions in respect of expenditure on research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, deductions in respect of "core technology" are to be limited to an arm's length amount. Secondly, amounts of expenditure incurred on core technology are to be excluded from the calculation of the reduced deduction that is available in the case of guaranteed returns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third amendment relates to deductions in relation to qualifying plant that is deductible in three equal instalments over three years. Where that plant is first eligible to be claimed as a deduction prior to 30 June  1993, it will continue to be deductible at a maximum of 150% after that date rather than 125% that is to apply to other types of expenditure deductible under the R&amp;D provisions after that date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Fringe Benefits Tax&mdash;Substantiation Discretion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also amend the fringe benefits legislation to provide the Commissioner with a discretion to accept a lower level of substantiation than is currently allowable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the present fringe benefits tax legislation, substantiation is required in order either to reduce the taxable value of certain fringe benefits or to ensure that certain other benefits are exempt from fringe benefits tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments will allow the Commissioner a discretion, similar to that contained in the income tax law when considering the substantiation requirements of the fringe benefits legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will have little impact on revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Education Entry Payment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An education entry payment for sole parent pensioners was announced in the 1991 Budget. The payment will be available to sole parent pensioners commencing or continuing full-time or part-time education courses which attract payment of AUSTUDY.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill ensures that, in common with other income payments, the education entry payment to be paid from 1 January 1992 will be taxed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impact of the proposal on revenue in each financial year is expected to be less than $100,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Technical and Procedural Amendments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will make some technical and procedural amendments. One will clarify the operation of the provisions that deal with the carry forward of excess foreign tax credits. Another will make a technical correction to accurately reflect the text of the Australia-Fiji comprehensive taxation agreement. And another deals with the publication of indexation factors to be applied in calculating the motor vehicle depreciation limit and the capital gains cost base limit.</PARA>

It was also the last sitting day before the ACT and Tasmanian elections. It was a day on which this matter was before the Senate. The Opposition embarked on the debate.

Both the first advice and the accompanying paper&mdash;a legal paper prepared by a research assistant to the Senate&mdash;reached the conclusion that the first and second sets of regulations made on 19 December and 3 January were imperfect or invalid but that the third set was probably valid and corrected the faults in the first set of regulations.

For some reason, supplementary advice was provided stating that in the view of the Clerk there was another possible problem with the regulations. Despite his earlier advice, Mr Evans stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the original sets of regulations as amended by the third group of regulations are probably valid.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that it may be, however, that the proper construction of sections 48A and 48B of the Acts Interpretation Act is that the provisions in the second set of regulations which repeal the first set of regulations were not the same in substance as those regulations. The regulations would therefore stand unless effectively repealed. The Clerk concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this interpretation is correct, there are now no valid regulations in force. . .</PARA>

<PARA>This is a gross act of dishonesty, improper behaviour and distortion of the advice, although a continuation of consistency in Senator Parer's campaign. It did not just stop there. Senator Parer also stated that the Clerk's advice suggested that television stations could sue the Government for loss of advertising, yet nowhere in the Clerk's advice and nowhere in the research officer's paper do we find any suggestion that television stations could sue the Government for loss of advertising. That is a gross distortion of the truth, but that does not bother Senator Parer. If he has been consistent about one thing in this place, his consistency has been in distorting the truth. Nowhere in either the Clerk's advices or the paper accompanying them is this proposition canvassed. Not only do qualifications appear but also phoney propositions are wrongly attributed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The end result of this short period of testing this legislation has been twofold. On the one hand, we have had an enormous decrease in electoral expenditure, which was one of our initial objectives. On the other hand, we have seen the process of democracy working in a way that we on this side of the chamber said it would and the Democrats also said it would. Governments have changed, independent minority candidates have been elected and there has been a massive turnout in the polls&mdash;in fact, in some instances, higher than in the previous Federal elections where advertising applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people out there have, through formal and informal polls, made it very clear that they do not miss political advertising. The parties have also indicated, although indiscreetly sometimes in respect to some Opposition spokespeople, that they have appreciated not having to raise and spend as much money as they had to in the past. People have been able to get their information about the political process through the electronic media, through every other channel but paid advertising. When we introduced this legislation, we said at the start that there is nothing more undemocratic than having a person's voice and the level of that voice depend on how much can be spent to push it through the electronic media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time, nothing has happened to dispute that fact. In fact, other countries are already looking at this legislation. I have had messages from legislators in the United States supportive of it. There is nothing new about this Bill in a world sense; there is nothing radical about this measure in a world sense; there is nothing unprecedented about it. It applies in just about all Western liberal democratic countries. We somehow got it through the Senate. We anticipated that there would be opposition from the Opposition, which basically does not really see the need for reform in any area. We have brought in a measure which, in its initial application, has been successful. It has been successful in terms of both the process and the parties involved. </PARA>

If the Opposition's motion gets up, what effect will it have? It will have absolutely none at all.

By supporting this legislation, the Democrats have denied him, as a candidate, an opportunity to communicate to the electorate prior to that election. Depending upon the election result, it may well be that, if he is not elected, he will challenge that in the court. If that occurs and he wins, which some legal opinion suggests he might, there will be another election. That is something that I am positive nobody wants.

It tried to fix that up by a second proclamation, gazetting both on 3 January. At this point the Government had repealed and redrafted the regulations.

This was corrected by yet another set of regulations on 10 January. But, according to advice, these may well also be void.

They said, `We will use this Select Committee to stop any ad ban Bill going through and to stop disclosures'. They were the hairy chested ones. Even Senator Bronwyn Bishop got rolled, because Kemp and Olsen had to prove how hairy chested they were. They promised, with Senator Parer, that this Bill would not go through. There was statement after statement saying, `This is a dead Bill'. For month after month they crowed in this place and, of course, now they have to cop it; they lost. This is another chance that they are using to try to tell their mates in the Liberal Party, `Look, we are still having a good go. We are sorry we lost last year. We promised you that we would defeat it. We promised you that we would knock it over in the Select Committee but we failed. But we will have one more go'&mdash;by trying to disallow regulations that are already dead! That is how stupid they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go through the results of the three elections. We were told by honourable senators opposite that this Bill represented the end of free speech: the equivalent of the end of motherhood, Christianity and everything else that is good in society. The first place in which it operated was The Entrance by-election. Usually in State or Federal by-elections in the last 50 years there has been very little electronic advertising. The Liberals said, `We will have radio ads in The Entrance'. They were taken off air. This was represented as a dreadful defeat for free speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened in The Entrance by-election? Despite Greiner trying to pull a stunt and holding it in the middle of the holiday season, in the middle of January, what happened? There was the highest turnout in recent history; 93 per cent of the enrolled electors in The Entrance turned out and voted. If this Bill was denying free speech and stopping communication, how come we had such a high turnout? Of course, we cannot get an answer out of members of the Opposition as to why we had such a high turnout despite, as they say, the electronic ban operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people in The Entrance knew the issues. They knew the campaign. As was said in The Entrance election, all the parties had to go back and campaign amongst the people&mdash;face to face contact. That may be one of the reasons there was over a 90 per cent turnout when in a normal by-election it is somewhere between 75 per cent and 85 per cent. So on the first issue the Opposition has raised&mdash;that the ban would stop people being aware of an election&mdash;its argument has failed. That Entrance by-election had one of the highest turnouts in the history of Australia. There has been not one comment from the other side about that. </PARA>

It has had a good impact on the election campaign. That is what Mr Lister, a Liberal Party campaign director said. I wonder whether Senator Walters will get up and say that Mr Lister was wrong?

There was a complex arrangement aimed at giving them access to free time. Apparently one of them has complained, according to Senator Olsen, that he did not get access to free time.

If the Liberal Party in Victoria has bagfuls of money to spend, that is its business, but it cannot do so in an election campaign. There was no breaking of the spirit, there was no smart activity by the Liberal Party to get round the law. The law allowed it to do so and it took that opportunity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to other remarks made by Senator Olsen. I heard him say that this Bill breaks every international covenant on free speech, human rights, and goodness knows what else. He did not quote one paragraph from any international covenant as to where it could be broken. I point out to the Senate, and particularly to Senator Olsen, that during the Select Committee hearings when the point was made about breaking international covenants, we asked the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade whether in the previous 30 years it had at any stage thought it necessary to raise with countries that have much more draconian bans than contained in this legislation that this was an infringement under one of the United Nations covenants on political and civil rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple one-paragraph answer was `No', because no-one had ever claimed that the much more draconian bans in England, France, Germany, Spain, Norway or Sweden were in any way an infringement on free speech. So it was factually wrong for Senator Olsen to have got up and made the bland statement he did today. No-one anywhere has taken a case to any international court against any government over controlling, banning or limiting electronic advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1942 there has been a ban on paid advertising for three days from midnight on the Wednesday for State and Federal elections. No-one opposite challenged the constitutionality of that as a States rights issue in the High Court. In fact, a former Liberal senator from New South Wales, for many years the General Secretary of the New South Wales branch, Senator Carrick, was one of the great defenders of that three-day ban for State and Federal elections. After the 1983 election, I heard him propound that view before the original Select Committee on Electoral Matters. He did not even want to remove the limitation, which we removed, on having free comment on television or radio for the last three days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Carrick, who for 20 years was State Secretary of the New South Wales branch of the Liberal Party, said that we should even have the ban for the last three days in State and Federal elections. He was not arguing that this affected New South Wales. He did not argue a States rights case. He thought it was quite reasonable. Even at the height of the Menzies period, when States rights was the Liberal Party's highest icon of ideology, not one State branch of the Liberal Party wanted to challenge the power of the Federal Parliament under the Broadcasting Act to ban advertisements completely for the last three days of every State and Federal election campaign across Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>We did not hear one word out of the Liberal Party at that stage. No-one challenged the ban. No-one said, `It is an invasion of free speech if for the last three days you ban television and radio advertising for all elections everywhere in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is rather hypocritical, a case of selective history, for honourable senators opposite now to claim that they are the great defenders of political free speech when previously their representatives in this chamber defended the right of the Federal Parliament to use the Act to ban paid advertising on television and radio. No-one in this chamber has argued that, constitutionally under the Broadcasting Act, we have the right to ban cigarette advertising. The tobacco lobby has screamed and shouted that that is an infringement on free speech. I must give credit to a number of Opposition senators for supporting the Australian Democrats Bill to ban tobacco advertising. No-one has argued the constitutionality of the Broadcasting Act powers being a Federal power and that when the legislation is passed here it takes effect. It is irrelevant that people have worked themselves into a lather over States rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do those opposite really believe that the Federal Government, through the Broadcasting Act, cannot legislate to control in one form or another the nature of television advertising in a political campaign? Do they believe that people will say, `No, you have no power to control broadcasting in Australia for State election campaigns'? Does that mean that State governments can make laws relating to what goes on radio and television for their State elections? It is an extraordinary assertion that State governments could  overrule and amend a Federal Act, a Federal power. The contorted, convoluted arguments of States rights that some people opposite are now running with are extraordinary and are against all good government measures, and they themselves, in their saner moments, should realise that they cannot be proceeded with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court will deal with this case in March.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the people in the radio and television industry who are part of that challenge, who complain about free speech and so on as far as the Broadcasting Act and television Act are concerned, are the first people to come trotting to Canberra to demand that the Federal Government make regulations to control the entry of other television and radio stations. They want the Federal Government to regulate and control the radio and television spectrum. They want regulations made, wherever necessary, to ensure that their access to a monopoly market is controlled. They want no-one to be allowed to affect their powers to broadcast. When we say to them, `Look, you people want deregulation in some areas. Let's deregulate control of the spectrum' they are panic stricken. They do not want someone else jamming their signal. They accept that the Federal Government has the power to regulate the broadcasting and radio industry in this country, and to control the radio spectrum and broadcasting spectrum, which is a community resource. </PARA>

Senator Schacht made some personal comments about me and Senator Olsen. I will not bother to respond too much to those, except to say that when Senator Schacht speaks about human rights principles there will always be a hoarse laugh from this side of the chamber. When we look closely at his speech, do we see any element of the principle that people have a right to convey their views to the public, if they wish to, in the manner they choose?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was very noticeable on this side of the chamber that Senator Schacht's performance as Chairman of the Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures was absolutely disgraceful. Is it any wonder that Mr Keating did not promote Senator Schacht in the recent reshuffle in the Australian Labor Party? The reason for that must be that it would be seen to be Labor Party suicide to have Senator Schacht in control of any departmental matter before any committee in the future in view of his prior performance. In my mind, that view would be absolutely correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speakers on the other side of the chamber raised the issue of how this particular Act and its consequent regulations work. I plan to look at that issue in my remarks. A number of things can be said in summary about the effect of this legislation and the regulations about which there is a motion of disallowance before the chamber. Firstly&mdash;and I do not think anyone now argues this&mdash;the Act was entirely motivated by the financial destitution in which the Labor Party now finds itself. It is broke in most States, in huge debt in most States. It is a Labor Party without support, without the possibility of raising money, and a Labor Party which is determined as far as it can to tap into the taxpayer to fund its election campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to Senator Bolkus's comment that expenditure will be cut by this Act, that will be tested in the years to come, particularly in the next Federal election. My view is that expenditure will rise and rise substantially, but this time it will be the media companies that will be paying for it with free time and the consumers who will be charged extra as a result of the other advertisements on television. Above all, there is the amount of money that will be sucked from the taxpayer. So when the final accounts are in for the 1993 Federal election, we will find that election expenditure will have risen, and risen substantially. It will not be cut, as alleged by Senator Bolkus and Senator Schacht today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus made the point that this Bill has received wide acceptance. Senator Bolkus cannot be reading the newspapers, because virtually every media commentator and virtually every leader in major newspapers has roundly condemned this particular Act. Human rights organisations have also condemned this Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to Senator Kernot in a minute. The third general comment I wish to make is that the actions of the Australian Democrats in supporting this disgraceful Bill have been widely noted and widely condemned in the public. I have said in this chamber on at least four other occasions that the big winners out of this Act are the Australian Democrats and that is why they supported this Act. I have stated that the Act is worth $1.8m to the Australian Democrats in free television advertising in the next Federal election. This is probably the fifth time I have said that. I have contrasted that $1.8m with the $400,000 which the Australian Democrats spent in the 1990 election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, there is a bonus in the order of $1.5m to the Australian Democrats in TV advertising as a result of this Act being passed. I shall be listening to Senator Kernot's speech to see whether she challenges those figures. I have put them down four or five times and she has never argued about them. This is a disgraceful pay-off to her Party. The Democrats now receive extensive free time TV advertising, which they were never able to pay for before, while all those other groups, minor parties and lobby groups are banned from TV advertising. That is the deal the Democrats did with the Government. My figures have never been challenged by the Democrats, despite the fact that I have raised them four or five times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot interjecting&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kernot says that I am right. At last we have the admission. Senator Kernot has said that my figures are right. For the record, in 1990 the Australian Democrats spent $380,000 on election advertising; under this new Act, the Australian Democrats will be entitled to $1.8m in TV advertising. Senator Kernot has confirmed that my figures are correct. I thank her. What a disgraceful act it is to receive so much money on your own behalf while preventing other people from running advertisements on TV.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that support for the Democrats has fallen to 5 per cent. Frankly, the people who used to support the Democrats used to think that they, above all, were concerned with human rights and free speech. I suspect that they were concerned with those issues. The actions of Senator Kernot and Senator Coulter in supporting this Act have been widely condemned by members of their own Party. I suspect that if they look at why their vote has fallen to an all time low, they will see that this Act and the support they gave it is one of those reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final general point I wish to make is that the handling of the regulations in this Parliament by Senator Bolkus has been marked by a degree of incompetence and confusion that we have rarely seen in the Parliament. Senator Olsen has drawn attention to this. Senator Olsen outlined in some detail the mistakes that were made relating to the gazetting of this Act and the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is worth recording that these mistakes in the gazetting of the regulations are not only a matter for this Parliament, they are a matter for the Governor-General as well. This is not a trivial point. The whole purpose of allowing the Governor-General to make regulations is to ensure that by putting this process at the highest level of government, it is done properly. No-one can dispute, looking at the succession of errors that have occurred, that the Governor-General, Mr Hayden, has been placed in a most awkward and embarrassing position. He signed a proclamation that was not gazetted until the following day, in breach of the required procedure. He then had to be advised to sign another proclamation for the same Act the next day so that that could be properly gazetted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think honourable senators will know that it is a statutory requirement that the gazetting of proclamations must take place on the same day as, or an earlier day than, the commencement. It is not clear, to my mind, that the second gazetting validly commenced the Act. As Senator Olsen pointed out, this may be tested in the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the Governor-General should look very closely at any future advice coming from Senator Bolkus and the Department of Administrative Services. I am not aware that Senator Bolkus has apologised to the Governor-General for the embarrassment that he caused&mdash;I certainly hope he has. It does not end there. The Governor-General has been advised to sign three different sets of regulations for the same Act. Furthermore, it is still not clear, despite what Senator Schacht and Senator Bolkus have said, whether any of those regulations are validly in force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the best thing this chamber can do now, as a result of the workings of this particular Act and as a result of the confusion surrounding the tabling of regulations, is to throw them out lock, stock and barrel. I remind Senator Kernot that this Act was rushed through the last sitting of the Parliament, with the support of the Australian Democrats, and it has now been tested, as a number of speakers have pointed out, in four elections. Despite what Senator Schacht and Senator Bolkus have said, in each of those elections there has been major controversy relating to this Act and the decisions that have been made by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give an example from my own State, Victoria. An extraordinary situation arose in my own State in relation&mdash;would you believe&mdash;to a local council by-election in southern New South Wales. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal advised seven country TV and radio stations situated in Victoria not to broadcast Liberal advertisements concerning the Kirner State Government because of an upcoming local council by-election across the border in New South Wales in the Shire of Hume. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal claimed that the ads might be beamed to the voters in the New South Wales by-election. The fact that the Liberal Party was not even advertising in the region is a cause for some amusement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, this pre-emptive action by the ABT gives an indication, I believe, of the pernicious nature of this Act. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper pointed out, this direction from the ABT could have deterred the stations from broadcasting advertisements in a Liberal campaign directed at Victorian electors in anticipation of a Victorian election possibly many months away. I point out to Senator Kernot that, as it turned out, only one candidate emerged for the Hume Shire vacancy and no poll was required. By comparison and somewhat inconsistently, the ABT did not warn Victorian radio stations within hearing of Tasmania where a State election was imminent. No wonder there is widespread confusion about the operation of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As stated by the Victorian State Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Petro Georgiou, the ABT's move in the Hume council election:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . shows the absolute fractious nature of the Act, when a by-election in a local government area can affect the conduct of another State.</PARA>
<PARA>Just to clarify this matter for honourable senators, a by-election in southern New South Wales for a local council area could have affected TV advertising relating to an election in Victoria which could have been held many months distant, yet the ABT felt that because of the regulations in this Act and because of a council election in southern New South Wales it had to warn the seven TV and radio stations situated in Victoria that they should not be running Liberal Party advertisements. What an absolute farce!  As Petro Georgiou said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Labor Party has set out to protect itself by banning political ads, but forming a rats nest of contradiction and stupidity.</PARA>
<PARA>How true that is. I inform Senator Faulkner that even the State Secretary of the ALP, Ms Jenny Beacham, who is probably a person well known to him, was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> as saying that she was surprised the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal had interpreted the Act so widely. An absurd result occurred as a result of the Hume Local Council election in southern New South Wales and its consequent effect on Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Faulkner will recall, Senator Olsen raised these concerns at the Senate Select Committee hearing on a number of occasions. His concerns were dismissed by the Committee's report, yet what he predicted so well has in fact occurred. One positive result from the debacle of the Hume Local Council election of New South Wales and its effect on Victoria is that it seems to have prompted some rethinking by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht spoke about the results of the election in Tasmania. We repeatedly said that, if this Bill were passed, it would seriously affect groups apart from the major political parties and stifle free speech across a broad range of political activity. The Australian Democrats will say, `We did not get any free time in Tasmania'. Of course they did not get any free time in Tasmania because they did not run any candidates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since our human rights expert in this chamber, Senator Schacht, told us that it all worked well in Tasmania, let us take the case of the company Forest Resources and the Forest Industries Association whose advertisements were withdrawn by Tasmanian television stations because they might have breached the political advertising ban Act during the State election. It is clear that the legislation is so wide and ill-constructed that Tasmanian television stations could not risk the wrath of the Government should the ads be deemed to be in breach of the regulations. Senator Kernot would not worry about that because the matter involved a forest company and a forest association; but they are entitled to free speech and to put their views across as much as she is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So one particular group with a major interest in jobs in that State&mdash;and jobs was a central issue of the campaign in Tasmania&mdash;was unable to put its views across. But guess which group could put its views across on free time? The Green Independents had plenty of free time to put their views across. I would like Senator Kernot, when she gets up, to tell me whether she believes that that is fair so that we can test yet again the commitment of the Australian Democrats to human rights. Again, we will wait with interest for Senator Kernot's speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to Dr Robert Bain, the Executive Director of the National Association of Forest Industries, the advertisements which were pulled had been running for months and, in his view, none of them contained a political message. Yet, as Dr Bain explained, they fell foul of the legislation simply because forestry may have become an issue in the Tasmanian election. So while the forest industry was prevented from running its ads, there is no doubt that the Green Independents, who in many areas opposed the forest industry, were given a pretty good go at putting their views on television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the debacle did not end there. It may not be appreciated by honourable senators that, when the Forest Industries Association advertisement was banned in Tasmania, it caused the cancellation of the advertisement in regional Victoria. How did this happen? It so happens that the television station handling the advertisements for the forest industry in Tasmania receives part of its programming from BCV-8 in Bendigo, Victoria. Consequently, when the advertisements were banned in Tasmania they were also pulled in regional Victoria, even though there was no election there. Again, we see shades of the Hume local government election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian newspaper industry is the big winner out of this ban because, as Senator Kernot well knows, the money that would have been spent by political parties on television ads will be diverted in part to advertisements in newspapers. So in that practical sense, newspapers are the big winners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Senator Kernot does not understand is that, unlike our human rights expert, Senator Schacht, the newspapers are taking a principled stand. Despite the financial benefit they get from this Act&mdash;like the one the Democrats get from the Act&mdash;they are violently opposed to what they call a dangerous ban. The newspapers are quite right in opposing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The election in the ACT was raised, and a number of matters occurred that are worth recording for later consideration. One issue that arose in that election was privatisation. It is interesting that ACT Electricity and Water was allowed by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to continue an advertising campaign of community messages with a `feel-good' appearance, as they say, which clearly could have been interpreted as or had the effect of influencing viewers' minds on the issue of privatisation. That advertising was apparently allowed to run, although, as I mentioned, the privatisation issue was a matter of debate in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The forest industry, whose ads were banned in the Tasmanian election, was allowed to run ads in the ACT election. It is no wonder that there is total confusion over how this Act operates. People who wish to take part in election campaigns do not know what their rights are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other issues are involved. Honourable senators will recall the referendum campaign in the ACT. The Hare-Clark Campaign Committee was the victim of the Act this time. Despite receiving legal advice from four separate sources, as well as initial verbal advice from the ABT, that it could run its ads in favour of the Hare-Clark system, it joined the banned brigade in the end. At the last moment the solicitors advising FACTS advised television stations not to run the ads. Apparently, FACTS used a very narrow interpretation of the Act. But can it be blamed? In the absence of reliable guidelines, the industry has been forced to err on the restrictive side or run the risk of heavy fines or, indeed, licence loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently, it was argued in the ACT in relation to the referendum and the Hare-Clark Campaign Committee that, because a political party was registered with the name `Hare-Clark' in its title and the candidate for that party was entitled to free time as a former member of the Legislative Assembly, the Hare-Clark Campaign Committee could not run its ads. The risk posed by the Bolkus Act was too high. In other words, it was said that this information was already being run in free time. The fact that it was being run by a different organisation and people who may or may not have had the same focus on a particular issue did not deter FACTS. It was clear that FACTS had to make a very conservative decision in the absence of clear guidelines. That example highlights the unfairness with which these regulations treat community groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also highlights the fact that, given the lack of guidelines, TV stations are forced to withdraw advertisements which might not offend the Act, just to avoid the chance that after the fact they might lose their licences. That has happened. Senator Kernot can sneer, but who can blame the TV stations for taking a very restrictive view because they may lose their licences?<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kernot may believe that she would be pretty tough on this but, again, it is not her money on the line; it is not her licence on the line. As was pointed out by some of my colleagues, one party in the ACTU was able to circumvent the Act. One party was able to get its advertisements on TV and in the clubs. What party do honourable senators think that was? It was the ALP. Members of the ALP believe in rules to tightly regulate and restrict election activities. They believe in that legislation. But they do not believe in applying it to themselves, as we have seen time and time again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just what are the criteria being used by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to determine what advertisements can be aired and which cannot? This question has been raised by the Business Council of Australia, which has expressed concern that the ABT has no clear guidelines for determining what advertisements may be banned under this Act. The BCA is also concerned about the prospective element of the ABT's discretion. That is, the ABT not only has the apparent discretion to ban an advertisement dealing with an issue which is the subject of an election, but also may ban an advertisement that might become an issue in the election. Exactly how the ABT determines the subjective element is a matter of great concern, I suspect, to a wide range of community groups. As the Business Council's Director, Mr Paul Barrett, has observed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is vital that the ABT publicly explain its interpretation of the new laws.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Barrett is further reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABT has adopted a wide interpretation of what constitutes political broadcasting, one which has particular implications for the rights of individual businesses and business organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not just business organisations that are affected, but any community organisation which wishes to run advertisements which could be interpreted as being in any way political. As I said, just look at what happened to the Forest Industries Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer, the shadow Minister for Administrative Services, wrote to Mr Westerway, the Chairman of the ABT, seeking some clarification on paid advertisements on radio and TV in respect of the referendum in the Australian Capital Territory. In reply, Mr Westerway said that the ABT does not have the charter it claims to issue guidelines to licensees as to what is an acceptable or unacceptable advertisement in relation to the Act. Instead, it is up to the licensee to decide the issue&mdash;and at his peril if he gets it wrong. The licensee can be forgiven, therefore, if he decides to withdraw questionable advertisements and to avoid the possibility of massive fines or the loss of a licence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been through a number of examples which have emerged in relation to the elections which have been held in the seven weeks since this legislation became law. I believe that these regulations, and the way they have been interpreted, cause massive confusion and serious inequities in relation to the campaigns which were run in the various States and the ACT.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said in January this year that the Government would monitor the effectiveness of this legislation and would re-examine it with the experience of the Entrance by-election, the Tasmanian State election and the ACT election behind him. He did that because so many amendments had been moved to the original legislation that it would be sensible to see how it worked in its final form after it had been tested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that those three elections are over, there is certainly an ample supply of evidence for us all to examine. The first thing that should be said is that this legislation has produced some of the expected benefits that those on this side of the chamber argued would occur as a result of this legislation being enacted, plus a benefit that no-one really expected or canvassed during the debate that we had on this legislation. That was the benefit of the return to personalised campaigning, or grass roots campaigning as it has been termed by others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to concentrate on three aspects in trying to make a judgment on the effectiveness of the legislation: firstly, voter turnout; secondly, the quality of campaigning; and, thirdly, the cost of campaigning. In relation to voter turnout, we were told by the Opposition ad nauseam that, with an electronic advertisement ban, electors would not know an election was on, would not go out and vote, and that there would be a low voter turnout. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first real test of that came smack in the middle of the Christmas holidays when, for the first time since 1939, the Premier of New South Wales called a State by-election in the middle of the Christmas holidays. Of course, I expect these sneaky, desperate manoeuvres from people like Nick Greiner, and he was very desperate. He is really on the ropes in New South Wales. He has lost his parliamentary majority. So he decided to pull a swiftie on the voters of the Entrance. He hoped to catch everyone napping. He hoped to catch the Labor voters who were out on the beach having a well-earned holiday and thought that he would be able to use a dirty trick to gain some short term political advantage and perhaps win the Entrance by-election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, even though this is the first by-election held in the Christmas holidays in New South Wales since 1939, the voter turnout in The Entrance was outstanding. Also, for the 10 by-elections held prior to The Entrance by-election in New South Wales, the turnout figure ranged from 70.06 per cent in the North Shore by-election to 87.6 per cent in the by-election for Wallsend. In the by-election for The Entrance, the turnout was 91.01 per cent&mdash;in the middle of the school holidays. That compared with a general election turnout in The Entrance on 25 May 1991 of 93.46 per cent. Nobody, not even the Opposition, can argue that that is not an outstanding result in terms of voter turnout. In fact, it is a record by-election turnout in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition also said that without electronic advertising there would be a massively increased informal vote in elections but, of course, that proved to be incorrect in The Entrance also because, while the informal vote in the general election of 1991 was 8.26 per cent, in The Entrance by-election it was 1.57 per cent&mdash;a drop of 6.69 per cent. So, again, they are extraordinary figures. The only differences that I can see between what occurred in The Entrance and all other by-elections and the general election are, firstly, the sneaky trick of Nick Greiner to hold it when he thought people would not be around&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The sneaky trick of Mr Greiner to hold it when he thought no-one would be around in the school holidays; and, secondly, the electronic advertising ban. Those figures are even more amazing when one considers that absentee voting was not available to the electors in The Entrance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar pattern can be seen in Tasmania. In the previous State election in Tasmania the total State turnout was 93.5 per cent, but in the recent State election, again, there was an increased voter turnout of 95 per cent. I might say that the seat of Braddon had its highest turnout ever. There was a turnout of 96.7 per cent; the previous figure was 94 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again in Tasmania, the State-wide informal vote fell from 5.3 per cent at the previous State election to 3.8 per cent on the most recent occasion&mdash;giving the lie to what the Opposition said would occur in relation both to turnout figures and to informal voting. Frankly, I think we can say that the jury is not out on either of those issues: everything that the Opposition argued would occur in relation to these voting statistics was wrong&mdash;on all counts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing that has changed, of course, is the quality of campaigning. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 18 January, Deidre Macken, talking about The Entrance by-election in New South Wales, said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without the distractions of music and slow-motion images of politicians, the messages should become more substantial, thoughtful and detailed.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that has become true. What has occurred is that, with the electronic advertising ban during the campaign period, candidates had to get out and do more grassroots and more localised campaigning. For the first time in a long while, prospective politicians had to get out and meet a few voters&mdash;and many people from all sides of politics have recorded that as a very positive impact of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 1 February of this year, Andrew Darby said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been another discovery: that electors still like to meet the politicians they vote for. In community halls, on boat cruises, at athletics carnivals and in street markets, all the serious candidates have been out meeting voters.</PARA>
<PARA>At the time this legislation went through, there were some who suggested&mdash;even some in the Australian Labor Party&mdash;that the Labor Party might well be throwing away a great advantage that it had as a political campaign tool, because there is no doubt that the Labor Party has proved, over at least the last decade if not the last two decades, that it was a far superior campaigner on the electronic media. It was suggested that we might in fact be throwing away a major advantage. But I am pleased to say that The Entrance by-election result proves yet again that our superiority is not limited to only the electronic media; we are certainly superior at localised and personalised grassroots campaigning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was shown by not only the result in The Entrance but also the response of the electors of The Entrance to our doorknocking campaigns and our booth workers. This can be contrasted with the way the Liberal Party handled the election campaign, which was to hire some spivvy electronic media consultants who were associated with one of Reagan's election campaigns in an attempt to buy the by-election, having already tried to gain a distinct advantage by pulling on the election in the Christmas holidays. It did not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This move to grassroots campaigning is something that not only Labor Party members can say advantages them; there is also a range of people from other political parties who have obviously noted that some of the impacts of this legislation are very good. Let us take, for example, Tasmania, where a range of Liberal Party candidates and officials argued that the ban, in fact, had been very positive for the whole of the political process. That included the Mouth from the South, Michael Hodgman, and Bob Lister, the coordinator of the Liberal Party campaign in Tasmania. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> radio program on 28 January he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, certainly the public have had the opportunity to question policies and candidates which, I am sure, is a good thing, and I believe the candidates have got closer to the public with some of their issues and have listened to the public, so I think that can only be good for the campaign, as well.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on, as Senator Bolkus said earlier, to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't believe there's any disadvantage for any particular party.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the proof of the pudding is in the eating: the senior Liberals in recent elections and by-elections have conceded that they have no reason to complain about this legislation or the results of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other thing I would like to touch on is the issue of cost in election campaigns. The new Tasmanian Premier, Mr Groom, indicated that the cost of the Liberal Party campaign in Tasmania was down by about 50 per cent. The Australian Labor Party's campaign coordinator in Tasmania said that the Labor figures were very similar. Of course, the only exception to that was The Entrance by-election, where the Labor Party's campaign expenditure was down significantly&mdash;well under six figures&mdash;whereas, of course, the Liberal Party on that occasion tried to buy the by-election by spending over a quarter of a million dollars, but I am pleased to say that it failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least there is significant evidence that things are moving in the right direction. From the two elections and one by-election since this advertising ban was put in place, there is significant evidence that the costs of campaigns have come down. I believe that that will in turn lead to cleaning up the political process in this country&mdash;something which the Government has so strongly supported and which was the fundamental reason for our introducing this legislation into the Parliament last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, to the extent that we have been able to make a judgment about the effect of the Bill in its operation in the ACT election, the Tasmanian State election and the Entrance by-election, I think that it has worked well. There is every hope, and the evidence suggests, that the legislation will work well again in the future. I oppose this preposterous disallowance motion presently before the Senate. I ask not only the Government but also the Democrat senators to hit this motion right out of the ballpark to where it belongs. </PARA>

<PARA>I think it is very unfortunate that the advice of the Clerk has been distributed and misused in this way. The qualification is a very big and important qualification. It is one thing to seek advice, but it is another thing to use that advice in a partisan political way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previous speakers have cited examples of those who, having experienced the impact of this legislation for the first time, have pronounced it to work well and to be a great idea. I too want to go on record as quoting the remarks of that very voluble Liberal from Tasmania, Mr Hodgman, who is reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age </EMPHASIS>to have said that the campaign in Tasmania conducted under this legislation was a very successful exercise not just because of the face-to-face contact but also because politicians in markets and on corners talking to constituents were a very colourful scene which captured media attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debate we heard a great deal about how nobody would be able to get his message onto the news because the news would not want to cover such boring things as politicians talking to electors. That has not been the early experience in Tasmania. The article went on to say that Mr Hodgman believes that the legislation is quite popular with the community and that he thinks that people `are very glad not to see politicians in their living rooms all the time'. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been another discovery: that electors still like to meet the politicians they vote for.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important principle of which we have lost sight in campaigning in recent years. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In community halls, on boat cruises and at athletic carnivals and in street markets all the serious candidates have been out meeting voters.</PARA>
<PARA>That is much healthier than people voting for anonymous candidates on party tickets. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper of 24 February this year stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Politicians are having to work to win votes as both the Labor Party and the Coalition embark upon old-fashioned `press the flesh' campaigns to beat the ban on television and radio commercials.</PARA>
<PARA>That is another healthy return to something which, I think, can only be to the advantage of the political process in this country. In the ACT elections, Malcolm Mackerras made a point of saying to the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Coulter, that although he was opposed to the legislation when he first heard about it, now having seen it work, having been part of the Hare-Clark campaign in the ACT, he thought that it had worked extremely well and that it had not been disadvantageous to the political process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point I have a word of criticism for the ACT Chief Minister, Rosemary Follett, and the ALP because I believe that they deliberately flouted the spirit of the legislation by advertising in cinemas and on closed-circuit television&mdash;not on Sky Channel, as Senator Olsen asserted, but on closed-circuit television in clubs. Of course, this does not come under the technical definition of free to air broadcasting. Nevertheless, the intention of using it is exactly the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has always been the Australian Democrats' view that cinemas and closed-circuit television ought to be included in some definition of broadcasting. The ALP may have thought that it was very clever to have exploited this loophole, but I think it is just typical of the tactics and the manipulation that the electorate is crying out to be protected from and which is represented in their approval of this legislation. I understand that when the advertisements were shown in the cinemas they were greeted with loud and hearty boos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Olsen and others have been raising the argument yet again of the loss of freedom of speech. I point out to him what his Liberal colleagues are doing in Victoria. Within the spirit of the Bill, they are now advertising, as they are allowed to under this Bill, for the 337 days of the year when an election campaign is not being conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The merit of this is that people watching these advertisements have time for reflection, consideration and discussion of the issues raised. I think that is a necessary part of the democratic process. They should not be bombarded by 30 second grabs and mindless jingles and slogans; they should have time to think. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp said that commercial television networks operated in fear of being in breach of the regulations. The truth is, I believe, that the television networks were absolutely bloody-minded because it suited them to be in their interpretation of the regulations. They wanted to show that they could make it difficult for the regulations to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When they screened the free time, they coincidentally said, `We are being forced to show this advertisement and this advertisement is costing us money'. But it was rather funny how in the Queensland referendum campaign the commercial television stations were quick to jump in and offer free time to those who were advocating a Yes vote because that vote coincided with their own political view. There was no concern there about the loss of revenue or the principle of having to screen advertisements on a political point of view because it coincided with their own view. It was hypocrisy on their part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Olsen said that the Democrats had walked away from the protection of the rights of the individual. In fact, I repeat that this legislation protects people from the emotive, manipulative, deceptive advertising which has been a characteristic of campaigns in this decade. Senator Olsen said that the Democrats were advantaged by this legislation. He said that we had our hands in the lolly jar, and Senator Kemp repeated that we would receive the benefit of $1.5m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp might be surprised to know that I do not resile from this because it is a consequence of an important principle&mdash;the principle that democracy should not depend on the purchasing power of political parties, and that everyone who is represented in this Parliament is entitled to be heard. It does not matter whether the 10 per cent of the vote is reflected proportionately in $1.5m, $500,000, $2m, or whatever is the going rate for advertisements; it is the principle that matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Kemp does not like the democratic principle, if he prefers the principle that money talks, I do not believe that he can stand up and talk about freedom of speech and the rights of the individual. Whether the 10 per cent translates into money for the Democrats, the Greens, the Citizens Electoral Council, the Fred Nile group or the conservative Liberal Party, the principle is that money should not speak. Much more important is the principle of people being represented in proportion to the votes cast in favour of their candidate. They have a right to be heard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp said that the Democrats did not qualify for free time in Tasmania because they did not run. Of course, that was the case, but he neglected to use the example of the ACT where they did run and where they did not qualify for free time. They accept that and they were not elected. Senator Kemp spoke of the need for amendment, as if that would be such a shockingly outrageous thing. Of course we never amend legislation in this place, do we? Without compromising the spirit and principle of the Bill, on behalf of the Democrats I am willing to look at areas where amendment is needed or necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable senators of the words I used in my speech during the second reading debate. I said that very few Acts of Parliament are perfect, whether drafted by Labor or Liberal governments. It is more than appropriate that we review all legislation. That is why we successfully moved an amendment to this Bill calling for an automatic review of this Act after two Federal elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not convinced that the technical problems with the regulations, the failure to gazette by the due date, the renumbering by the Clerk of the House of Representatives, or the other anomalies to which previous speak-</PARA>
<PARA>ers have alluded, are sufficient to warrant the disallowance of these regulations. By all means let us look at where some of the smaller hitches occurred, but let us not abandon the principle that money does not buy government in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not go down the American path. The coalition in its health policy has rightly identified the fact that it does not want to go down the American path where only those who can afford to can receive adequate medical attention. We in the Democrats do not want to go down that path in the conduct of elections in this country. Let us not abandon the principle that money should not buy government&mdash;that information and not glib misinformation is vital to democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the arguments in this debate and the way the electorate feels about the matter were well summed up in a cartoon I saw. The cartoon portrayed viewers sitting in front of a television set on which were the words `Political advertising banned'. The viewers were celebrating with glasses of champagne and streamers. There was much jollity. They know that they are being saved from banality and from the misinformation that does nothing for the democratic processes in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the concentration on grassroots campaigning, which has been one of the consequences of this legislation, I think the ultimate effect could well be that the level of the public's respect for this institution and for parliamentarians could well be raised.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again we are debating a particular brand of Labor democracy. We have done so on many occasions. When Labor ran out of money because Western Australia Inc. came to light, it decided that at the next election it would not have enough money to advertise on the electronic media.

Labor argued that if it could not pay and we were not allowed to pay, there must be a way around it&mdash;so it decided that it would get the taxpayers or the commercial companies and the television stations to pay. So once again the taxpayers are to foot the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not forget that it was only a few years ago that the Government decided that the taxpayers really should be footing the bill for an election campaign. The Government decided that the taxpayers should pay the relevant party 92c&mdash;nearly a dollar&mdash;per vote for that party. Following the first election the votes were counted and at the next election the taxpayers had to pay that particular party nearly a dollar a vote for every vote it collected. That applied to all the parties and all the independents that got the vote. So the taxpayer is already paying a considerable amount for each Federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition vigorously opposed that legislation. We do not believe that the taxpayers should be burdened with that type of payment. I ask whether Senator Button could imagine that applying to the States. At the moment, with Labor getting only 29 per cent of the vote in Tasmania, at the next election it would not have much to spend. That is quite a thought. However, that does not apply to State elections, only to Federal elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at what else the taxpayer will pay for under this new legislation. In all their wisdom the Government and the Democrats decided that they would not have the money come an election and that the taxpayers would pay for every household in Australia to get a pamphlet put out by every candidate&mdash;not every sitting member, every candidate. So the thousands of candidates that will be up for the next election for all the seats in the House of Representatives and the Senate will be entitled to have their personal pamphlet put in the letterbox of every household at taxpayers' expense. It is estimated that will cost over $8m in addition to what the taxpayers already pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Imagine the abuse in a country town where a businessman has set himself up and has not been doing too well. He cannot afford the normal advertising that would blanket every household. He could decide that, for the up-front payment of just $250, he would supposedly stand as a candidate because his pamphlet would contain his photograph and what he wanted to put in it. Therefore, for that paltry cost he would be able to have a pamphlet containing a description of him and his business and a photograph, put in the letterbox of every single household in his area&mdash;all paid for by the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button will acknowledge, because he has been here some time and done it for many elections&mdash;as I have done&mdash;how difficult it is, after all the candidates have been selected, to get their photographs and what they want in their pamphlets all concisely done very quickly. The Electoral Commission will be responsible for getting that pamphlet into the letterboxes. Sometimes it is only three weeks before the election that the last of the independents or the candidates are selected. In those three weeks the Electoral Commission would be responsible for getting photographs of all the candidates in Australia and what they want in their pamphlets delivered into the letterboxes of householders. Can the chamber imagine this being done in time? Absolute rubbish! As I have already said, the abuse that is open to a businessman, for a paltry cost of $250, to saturate his area with his photograph and his business advertisements, I believe, is quite a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have the taxpayer paying for that. We have the ABC&mdash;and, of course, it is not the ABC, it is the taxpayer&mdash;once again paying for a considerable amount of free time. We have the television and radio commercial stations also being told they will foot the bill. Not the Government, not the taxpayer, but the commercial stations are being forced to put on free time and foot the bill. What will happen is that the commercial stations will pass on those costs of the advertisements to businesses. So there is an additional cost for businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the free time on radio and the free time on television being forced on commercial stations, the taxpayer paying for the ABC and this is how the Government is meant to be making election advertisements more fair and equitable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer the Minister to the Prime Minister's disgraceful misrepresentation yesterday of a paper prepared by Dr Chris Murphy relating to the coalition's Fightback package and to the fact that Dr Murphy has subsequently found it necessary to issue a formal statement correcting the Prime Minister's `significant misrepresentation'. Why did Mr Keating fail to tell the truth on this matter on his first full day in the Parliament as Prime Minister, and is this the standard of political integrity we can expect from him in the lead-up to the next election?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Prime Minister said something about Dr Hewson playing the man rather than the ball yesterday and on several previous occasions. Let me just say in relation to that that one of the extraordinary things about this Opposition has been its incapacity to read its own documents, to read the tables in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document, and to understand what Dr Murphy was in fact saying in his paper delivered at the ANU.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell honourable senators what the Murphy paper in fact shows. It shows that under the scenarios in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document, unemployment would be higher after five years&mdash;only a little higher under the base case to which Dr Murphy refers, but by two percentage points if wage setting arrangements could not be guaranteed and they had to be discounted for the higher prices arising from the Hewson package. That is what Dr Murphy's paper says and shows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition, which has no wages policy at all, speaks about the possibility of discounting wages&mdash;a defect which was with the Liberal Party through eight years of the previous Government, which is still loitering around and which will come back to haunt it every day of the next 12 months. Looking at what Dr Murphy says, those opposite have to ask themselves why workers would discount wages in the terms suggested under the Hewson package which would increase the price of food and clothing and all the staples that are much more relevant in the economy of a lower income family than they are in a rich family. And that is a fact&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>the price of food and clothing is a much more relevant fact for a poorer family. So why would workers discount wages, as is suggested? It would have to be a marvellous wage policy which would deliver such a result. But, of course, there is no wage policy at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that Dr Hewson himself is more intent on talking up confrontation with unions than in arriving at a sensible wages policy. Liberal Prime Ministers were more interested in going to royal weddings than dealing with wage policy issues. If there were ever a Liberal government again, its leader&mdash;the present leader, if he remains leader&mdash;would be more interested in confrontation than working out a sensible wages policy.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, have a look at his press release&mdash;a simple-minded grab for the press. There are no pictures in it, so Senator Alston probably would not understand it. Under Murphy's own scenario, there would be a small increase in unemployment over five years and a small reduction in unemployment 10 or 20 years out. Those opposite may think they are going to be there for the long haul&mdash;10 or 20 years&mdash;but the people of Australia would not tolerate that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what it would mean: in pursuit of an ideologically led, tax-led recovery, so-called, the people of Australia would be put through the incredible pain of there being no improvement in the unemployment situation and no improvement in GDP for 20 quarters. If the coalition could not deliver discounting of wages, there would in fact, under the Murphy document, be an increase in unemployment. Murphy goes on to establish that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer those opposite to Dr Murphy's own paper, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">GST and the Inflation Rate</EMPHASIS>, given on 24 February this year&mdash;it is hot off the press. If those opposite study the table on page 8, they will see in respect of the base case that 20 quarters out&mdash;that is, five years out&mdash;the unemployment rate at best has increased by 0.2 per cent. On the `wages up' case, the unemployment rate has increased by 2.1 per cent. That all depends on the capacity to deliver a wages policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures on GDP in the same document show real GDP, 20 quarters out, at minus 0.2 on the base case and minus 4.1 if wages go up in the relevant period. Five years of further misery is predicted by Dr Murphy in this document which he seeks to repudiate with a press release.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following the force structure review and the Wrigley interdepartmental committee, DSTO is required to reduce its staffing by 700 by June 1996. The review of MRL Tasmania is part of a wider review process which is determining options on the implementation of these reductions. The function of the food science branch at Scottsdale is to undertake studies and investigations of energy expenditure, nutrition and the development of ration pack components for the ADF. The branch also operates a small freeze-dried production facility. There are cost penalties and disadvantages in operating a small laboratory at a remote location, some of which are borne by employees, such as diminished career opportunities and limited access to technical and further education services.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is probably necessary to make a few points in context. First, during the life of this Government the high school retention rate has doubled. Therefore, we have increased funding for higher education by 41 per cent in real terms since coming to office. Over the last five years there has been an explosion in the demand for university places. There are now 120,000 more places at university than there were five years ago, and that is estimated to go up by 25,000 over the next two years. Historically, about 40 per cent of year 12 students go on to university; this year about 80 per cent of year 12 students have applied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem has to be seen against a background of a boom in university education, a record growth in the number of places and a record number of positions being achieved. It also has to be seen against the background that the growth of TAFE has been basically out of balance with the growth of university education. It has not kept up with the universities. It is not as attractive an option as it ought to be and it should be improved. That is the reason why the Government is putting money into and emphasis on the TAFE area&mdash;to make it a much more viable option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The press reports that Senator Zakharov has referred to have indicated that there are 21,000 who will miss out in Victoria, 48,000 in New South Wales, 22,000 in Queensland and 15,000 in South Australia. It will be nothing like that. These are raw figures. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee will look at those figures and the actual figure, as I say, will be about 50,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures are overstated because some of the applicants are ineligible in the first place; some lodge more than one application at a university or in more than one State; some have a limited range of preferences and will become ineligible; and some would refuse if a place was offered. So we are looking at raw figures which do not indicate what the actual number is because of all of those other factors. As I say, there has been an explosion in demand. That is partly because of the conditions of the general labour market&mdash;that is true&mdash;and partly because of the high success we have achieved in secondary school retention rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of contrast, we are trying to make university places available on merit&mdash;on the merit of the applicants. The Opposition's policy in the Hewson consumption tax package makes university places available on a `Who can afford to pay the fee?' basis. How much the fee goes up will determine whether one gets a place at university. Therefore, the Opposition would be auctioning places at university to the rich and privileged, not making them available to those who have merit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By the time I return, given that I know of at least one journalist who will be accompanying me on the trip, I doubt very much whether even Senator Alston will be able to claim that this is a junket. The purpose of the trip is to attempt, insofar as it is possible in the space of two weeks, to speak to as many of the regulators, pay TV operators, network players and manufacturers as I can so that I can come back here and live up to the Beazley timetable. To do that I would have to go to Cabinet, I reckon, by about the middle of April or perhaps later on in April, and I will only be able to do that properly if I consider that I have enough knowledge. I think I will need to do a lot of work on that trip to make sure that I am armed with sufficient knowledge to make the proper recommendations to Cabinet.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am being told by many of those who wish to be players in the pay TV game here that if that is the case, we will not have pay TV. I will be talking to quite a number of them on the trip, and I want to try to assemble enough information to see what kind of level there should be.</PARA>

They will be in the price cap of 4 per cent this year and 5 1/2 per cent for 1992-95. So I will not be worried about those. But once public pay phones and charges for directory assistance have been formally notified, I can either disallow them or refer them to Austel. In the normal course of events and in these kinds of matters, one would refer them on to Austel. That is probably what I will do, although, as I said, I still have not received a formal notification or explanation from AOTC.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security aware of recent press comments suggesting that women age pensioners whose partners are non-pensioners will be significantly disadvantaged by changes in the method of calculating their pensions? What are the facts of this change?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="223" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been quite a number of articles on this issue in recent times. Some of them have not been as truthful as I would like to have seen. From 26 March, where only one partner of a married couple is eligible for a pension and claims it for the first time, the maximum rate payable will be half the combined married rate of pension rather than the higher single rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Giles would be aware, currently only where one partner of a married couple is of pension age, entitlement is the lesser of the single rate of pension adjusted for half the income received by the couple or the combined married pension rate adjusted for all the income received by the couple. The decision to change this was taken on equity grounds. It means that all married pensioners will now be treated the same irrespective of whether their spouses are also pensioners. All married pensioners will receive half the combined married rate of pension, subject of course to the usual income and assets tests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pension rate structure is based on the view that couples can achieve economies by sharing their living costs. That is pretty well generally accepted. For that reason, the pension paid to a single person is higher than that received by each of a married couple. It is therefore illogical to continue to pay the single rate of pension to a married person simply because the spouse is not also a pensioner. Consequently, the maximum rate of pension, including the pharmaceutical allowance payable to that pensioner from 26 March, will be $257.90&mdash;that is, half the combined married rate per fortnight&mdash;rather than $311.30, which is the single rate per fortnight. That is a reduction of $53.40 per fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While that is obviously a very significant reduction, a couple of things should be borne in mind. Firstly, very few of this group of pensioners are receiving the full rate of pension. Most of them have spouses who are working or in receipt of some other income such as superannuation. Therefore, the dollar drop will be nowhere near that $53.40 a fortnight in most cases. It should also be remembered that no pensioner currently being paid at the single rate will have his or her pension reduced. However, it will be frozen until it is equal to half the combined normal married rate, after which it will be indexed normally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some misleading press comment as to when women in particular might apply for the pension. The new rules start on 26 March, not the end of February. It needs to be pointed out that, even if a woman can claim before then, she cannot be paid until the first pension payday after she turns 60. So a claim before 26 March may not necessarily result in the current rules being applied. For example, if a woman claims on 19 March but does not turn 60 until 2 April, the new rules will be applicable. However, if she turns 60 on 5 March and claims before 12 March, the old rules will apply. The change is obviously not targeted specifically at women; it applies to all married pensioners alike.</PARA>

Mr McComas arranged a meeting last Friday, I think it was, in Sydney, where this subject was debated. He had nothing but the right intentions in doing that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late last year, I authorised the release of reports by the marine incident investigation unit of the Department of Transport on the loss of two bulk carriers after loading in Australia. The first, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mineral Diamond</EMPHASIS>, foundered with the loss of all 26 crew in the south Indian Ocean on a voyage from Dampier to the Netherlands on 17 April last year. The investigation concluded that, while the cargo was presented and loaded correctly in Australia, it resulted in a high shear stress force applied at the engine room forward bulkhead. At sea, the ship is likely to have very rapidly foundered and broken up after a sudden catastrophic structural failure of the vessel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second vessel, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Starfish</EMPHASIS>, sailed from Port Walcott on 22 March last year for Poland. In the south Indian Ocean it diverted to Mauritius after water was being taken into the after cargo holds of the ship. The ship sank on 8 April after the successful evacuation, I am pleased to say, of the crew. The investigation into this incident found that the Australian cargo had been presented and loaded properly. There was insufficient evidence in Australia to determine the cause of the ship taking in water. While rough weather was encountered on the voyage from Australia, this should not have caused any problems for a well-found ship.</PARA>

That is why I am drawing to the attention of the Senate, in this matter of public importance, the Government's disastrous failure to resolve Australia's record youth unemployment crisis and its dishonest attempts to pretend that the real youth unemployment rate is less than the adult rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts of the existence of the crisis are self-evident, but let me quickly state them. There are no jobs available in Australia for one in every three full time job seekers. In some areas, it is closer to one in two young job seekers. One in two young Australians cannot find a full time job because there are no full time jobs available. The regions that are near or over the half way level&mdash;more than one in two&mdash;are north-west and outer western Melbourne; Wollongong; north and south-western Victoria, and we notice how Victoria dominates, having a Labor Government; northern Adelaide; Hobart; and Mackay in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures massively understate the real crisis at a time when this Government is pretending that the real crisis does not exist. I will deal with those Government claims in a minute. The reality of how these latest figures understate the real crisis is self-evident when one looks at the Australian Bureau of Statistics' figures. In the first place, the actual figures&mdash;not the seasonally adjusted ones which are referred to by the Government and by newspapers&mdash;far exceed the seasonally adjusted figures. In other words, the present situation is far worse and, of course, will continue to be far worse than the seasonally adjusted figures indicate at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second place, the Australian Bureau of Statistics itself has produced a series of figures showing that there are 130,000 discouraged job seekers. These are people who have lost their jobs and who are not even looking for jobs because they have been so discouraged. The ABS has demonstrated in a survey that the current unemployment figures understate by over 130,000 the number of Australians really wanting to have jobs. If we apply that figure to the 15- to 19-year-olds, we see that about 15,000 discouraged teenagers have given up putting their names down as unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, the ABS has done a survey of those people who are underemployed. I will deal with that at some length because that survey shows&mdash;and I will be revealing these figures for the first time later in this debate&mdash;that the real level of unemployment is over 40 per cent for young Australians between 15 and 19 years of age. They are official figures. They are not Baldwin inventions. They are not phoney Government figures. They are the official Australian Bureau of Statistics' figures for underemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I only took a section of the survey figures&mdash;a section that covers those people who were in part time work but who really wanted to have full time work and who would take a full time job if there were one available. On top of that we can see from the Australian Bureau of Statistics' figures the number of jobs lost over the last 12 months. We can see that the number of teenage jobs wiped out is about five times as high as the number of teenagers added to the unemployment list; the rest just disappear. I will explain why in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the real unemployment rate at over 40 per cent, or two in five young people, we then see the way in which this Government has used Austudy to hide the real level of unemployment. The Government has been paying young people to go back to school to get them off the unemployment lists, but is not providing jobs for them when eventually those young people spill over the dam wall into the labour market. That does not matter, does it, to the Labor Government!  As long as these people are out of the way for a while, the Government can doctor the unemployment figures. If the Government cannot doctor those figures well enough then it will invent them. The Government will then have Mr Baldwin inventing nonsense figures which are so nonsensical that not one developed country in the world uses the invented measure of unemployment that Mr Baldwin has magically discovered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see how the Keating Government is fixing this crisis&mdash;this crisis that really exists. Just ask any of the social workers in western Melbourne who I have spoken to with Senator Kemp. Just ask any of the young people themselves as they crowd around the CES offices. Just ask them what the real level of unemployment is. They certainly do not agree with Mr Baldwin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How is the Keating Government fixing this crisis? Firstly, it is fixing it by pretending that it does not exist. The Baldwin solution is to pretend that it does not exist. Mr Baldwin is the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services. He, if anyone does, should have a responsible approach and know what on earth he is doing. What does he do? He pretends that the real unemployment level in Australia is 8.8 per cent, which is lower than the adult unemployment rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one in Australia apart from Mr Baldwin, and aNiMaLS&mdash;who go around lying to the Press Gallery on the instructions of this Government, saying that the ABS figures are wrong and that when I cite ABS figures I am somehow misleading people&mdash;believes that that is the way to solve the problem. Apart from the aNiMaLS lying on the instructions of this Government, and apart from the Minister dishonestly and disgracefully seeking to mislead the Australian people by saying that the real unemployment rate for young people is 8.8 per cent, no-one believes that pretending that it does not exist is the way to solve the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the big lie is repeated over and over again, it makes it sound right. It may be that the Minister really does think that the unemployment rate is only 8.8 per cent for young people. Maybe the Government overwhelmingly believes that it is telling the truth. In that case the Keating Government's disastrous failure to resolve the record youth unemployment crisis is at last explained. It does not know it is there&mdash;that is why it has not fixed it. This lack of effective action on youth jobs would then be explained clearly by this incredible statement. I want to repeat this incredible statement as to this invented rate of 8.8 per cent. Mr Baldwin said that the full time unemployment rate for 15-19 year olds is really only 8.8 per cent. He said that this was only a quarter of the size of the actual official youth unemployment rate reported by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for January of 34.8 per cent, representing no full time jobs available for more than one in every three job seekers or 30 per cent after seasonal adjustments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Baldwin's pathetic claim that the ABS figures are 75 per cent wrong or have somehow been misrepresented is not backed up by any facts because there are none to back it up.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key things about these figures, which I will briefly outline, is that about 154,800 unemployed 15-19 year olds are looking for full time work; about 290,400 are employed full time, and so there is a full time unemployment rate of 34.8 per cent. If Mr Baldwin can do so, will he please tell us which of these official figures are wrong, which of them is misleading? If he cannot do that, will he please tell aNiMaLS to stop lying to the Press Gallery?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures specifically and clearly exclude those young people at school or in tertiary training who are not available for work. There is no doubt about that. Yet Mr Baldwin in his press release pretended that somehow these figures were unacceptable because they included them. I repeat that these figures specifically and clearly exclude those young people at school or in tertiary training who are not available for work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Mr Baldwin wants to omit from his figures all those in such institutions, the total of full time youth unemployed is still 134,700 out of a work force of 394,200, giving a full time unemployment rate of 34 per cent. Goodness me, what an incredible difference&mdash;34.8 per cent in the original figures, 34 per cent if one adjusts them in the way Mr Baldwin says he wants them adjusted. </PARA>

<PARA>invent enough figures regionally to come out with that sort of nonsense. There is no honest way that Mr Baldwin can get a real&mdash;and I stress this&mdash;full time 15-19 year old unemployment rate of 8.8 per cent. He can get a phoney figure, which is the proportion of the total population. It will be interesting to see Senator Cook cooking those books when it is his turn to respond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, having given Mr Baldwin five days to reply, I asked a question in this chamber as to how he justified those figures. We got no justification. Senator Cook did not know; he just felt confident that the figure was right. In fact, the figure is phoney. The figure has been subject to attack by newspaper editorials, attacked by welfare workers and attacked by anyone who knows anything about the subject. Yet we could not get a coherent response from Senator Cook yesterday, and we got no further response today after Question Time, although he said he would try to find out. Maybe he will tell us today. Mr Baldwin's contemptuous dismissal of the youth unemployment crisis inherent in his dishonest 8.8 per cent jobless figure is compounded by his arrogant refusal to come clean on the real size of this national disaster that his Government engineered in the recession that we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do we know that Mr Baldwin is phoney and behaving in a phoney way? We know because I have here an internal memorandum from the Department of Employment, Education and Training in which the Department of Mr Baldwin, who has invented a new system of measuring unemployment, uses the system that Mr Baldwin finds unattractive. I quote from the memorandum to the Minister's office from the South Australian end of his Department about two projects:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The projects are located in the Adelaide West Region (SA) and in the Illawarra Tablelands area (NSW). These locations have high youth unemployment and limited labour market opportunities for untrained workers.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a concession that there is a high level of unemployment. It says that in the western suburbs of Adelaide young people:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . are particularly disadvantaged in the education sector and in the labour market. Comparison of the May to July labour market statistics for 1990 and 1991 shows a 12.6 per cent decline in the 15-19 year old labour market participation rate.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we come to the guts of it. The memo says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also apparent that the current trends in unemployment, and in youth unemployment in particular, call for effective action. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Maybe effective action means telling fibs about the level of unemployment. We have seen nothing more, except hiding these people in schools under Austudy to get them out of the dole queues in order to create better educated dole queues. It went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The teenage full-time unemployment rate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is Mr Baldwin's own Department&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has increased to 28.1% in June 1991&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>it is a little behind the times; it is now 34.8 per cent&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">higher than the July 1983 peak&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>higher than the last recession&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of 27.6%. Increased educational participation explains the fact that as a percentage of the total teenage population, the teenage full-time unemployment was 8.4% in June 1991 compared to 12.5% in July 1983.</PARA>
<PARA>His Department says that it is because the Government has paid so many young people to get them out of the unemployment queues and send them back to school that, even as a percentage of the total population, the figure is slightly lower now than it was back in 1983. His Department uses the very measure that I use, the measure that this Government tells aNiMaLS to go around the gallery saying is a lie and which Mr Baldwin says is being misleading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe because Mr Baldwin thinks the advice from his Department is misleading is one reason why it has done nothing about it because all it has done is come up with phoney solutions with non-existent jobs. To accuse the coalition of creative accounting by daring to reveal the official ABS surveys is the last card in the pack. We never use anything other than official Bureau of Statistics figures. I get them&mdash;if the Minister wants to know&mdash;from the statistics section of the Department of the Parliamentary Library. Is he accusing them of being liars too?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government is ignoring all the evidence that the official ABS figures largely understate the disasters. There is huge underemployment as evidenced by an Australian Bureau of Statistics survey. When one adds the underemployed looking for full time work, who have part-time jobs, to the unemployed, one gets a total, basic unemployment figure of over 40 per cent. It is between 40.1 per cent and 40.5 per cent, depending on which figure one wants to use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is&mdash;and this Government is not prepared to face up to it&mdash;that it has no answers. At least we have: the Fightback package, which will create 2 million real jobs, not phoney jobs, to meet this real disaster. It is not a phoney disaster. We will create jobs for these people that the Government pretends do not exist. </PARA>

Both in his motion and in his speech he has used such terms as `dishonesty', `lies' and `phoney', and he has addressed this chamber with a great deal of passion. Passion is not, and never has been, any substitute for logic. It may be an indication of commitment, but it does not mean that it is rationally directed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am enjoined to prove it; I will shortly do that. There are a couple of threshold points that ought to be made to get the position into focus. In this debate about unemployment in Australia we rarely hear very much said about the participation rate. When we came to power in 1983 the participation rate in Australia was 60.3 per cent; that is to say, of all those people between the ages of 18 and 65 eligible to work in this country, 60.3 per cent of them were in the labour market and the rest were not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the big changes that has occurred over the life of this Government is that the size of the labour market has increased. The participation rate&mdash;all of the people seeking work&mdash;is now 63.4 per cent. They are significant factors because over the period of the Labor Government the size of the labour market has grown, and grown significantly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to apply to the present level of unemployment the same size of the labour market that applied in the last years of the Fraser Government, the level of unemployment in this country would be 5.8 per cent, not the levels that we are now looking at. That figure ought to be kept fair and square in the middle of the mind when this matter is being debated because our success in the total size of the Australian labour market being grown is one of the matters that is now being statistically used against us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before he concluded his address, Senator Baume said that the so-called Fightback package&mdash;the Hewson consumption tax package&mdash;offers a resolution to this problem. It does not. There is no part of it that does. In that package we see a watering down of sensible and reasonable labour market support programs so that once again&mdash;typical of the Opposition&mdash;the blame is put on the shoulders of those who are the victims and the burden of that cost of dealing with unemployment is carried by the poor in this community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those matters should be kept up-front because they inform the wider issues in this debate as I now turn to the basic question. The Government is not disputing the fact that the youth unemployment rate, in the size of the youth labour market presenting for employment, is 30 per cent.

I will ignore the unparliamentary reflection and go to the argument because the fraudulent nature of what he said needs to be explained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing I should say&mdash;this is a key and fundamentally relevant point in analysing this issue&mdash;is that the nature of the youth labour market is very different from that of the adult labour market. That point has been made by my ministerial colleague Mr Baldwin many times. In his press release on youth unemployment, issued last week, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The real percentage of young people genuinely seeking full-time work and who are unable to find it is 8.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not 30 per cent, the figure Senator Baume wishes to sustain. Let me explain why the youth labour market is so different from the adult labour market. There are three fundamental aspects that ought to be quoted. Firstly, the difference is due mainly to the large proportion in the 15- to 19-year-old age group who are undertaking some form of education and training. That is not a feature of the adult labour market; it is a feature of the youth labour market,  and it is a significant reason why the figures that have been presented are wrong. About 66 per cent of the 15- to 19-year-old age group are undertaking some form of education and training. With adjustments, that leaves about 28 per cent of this group in the teenage labour force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Approximately 70 per cent in the labour force are employed and 30 per cent unemployed. Or we can put it this way, which is the more accurate and honest way of putting it: if we have 10 young people, around seven of them will be in education or training, two of them will be employed, and one of them will be out of a job. Let us get our statistical basis right. That is why the youth labour market is a different labour market from the adult labour market. We cannot apply the measures that Senator Baume has applied. It would be absolutely false and misleading to characterise the unemployment rate for youth at around 30 per cent and one in three. Yet Senator Baume says in his press release that there are no jobs for one in three Australians. As I have demonstrated, the true figure is one in 10 young Australians who are unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make myself even more clear. No-one on this side of the Parliament, least of all me or the Minister, Mr Baldwin, is saying that the current level of youth unemployment is acceptable. Of course it is not acceptable. Indeed, the human face of this problem needs to be constantly kept in view, and we do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me look at some more facts that will not give the Opposition any joy. Under this Government, teenage full time unemployment has fallen by 40,600, or 25 per cent. Even so, taking into account the effects of the current recession, the number of young people unemployed now compared to April 1983 has fallen by 25.8 per cent. This fall in the number of young unemployed youth reflects a number of factors. They include higher rates of education retention&mdash;more kids have stayed at school longer in our period of government; enhanced labour market programs that provide training as an alternative; and the strong employment growth that has occurred in the economy between 1983 and 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a deliberate and considered policy of this Government to encourage young people to stay and finish high school and to undertake further post-secondary education. One of the important reasons why the Government has undertaken this policy is that the youth labour market is going through enormous structural change. Jobs that used to be there at entry level positions now do not exist. These jobs have traditionally required few skills&mdash;jobs such as couriers or telephonists. Due to organisational changes and the introduction of new technology, these sorts of jobs&mdash;the cheap jobs for young workers&mdash;are diminishing. That is why young people are responding to this Government's encouragement to go on to further education so that they will have the skills to contribute in a restructured work force, better levels of education, and be eligible for better classes and better quality of jobs later on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, what is the Government doing to assist the proportion of young people who are unemployed and about whom we are genuinely concerned? Quite a lot. The Government has demonstrated its commitment to assisting young people during an obviously difficult period. We have done this by historically high spending in the higher education sector. In real terms, we have increased spending in the higher education sector by 41 per cent since we came to power. That is not 41 per cent in dollar terms; that is a 41 per cent increase in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The adoption of the Finn agenda, which is a substantial report before us for young people's participation in post-compulsory education, is also one of the important considerations. Substantially, we have increased subsidies for the uptake of apprenticeships by employers, which is an area of general concern. We have been offering a range of labour market programs that have proven time and time again to be effective in retraining people and enhancing their prospects of finding a job. The training element in these programs is clearly the key element to their success, particularly for young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can now ask: what is the Opposition offering young unemployed people and the unemployed more generally? First, as I have said before, there is nothing at all in the consumption tax package for young unemployed. In fact, labour market programs, because of the consumption tax package, will be cut by an amount of $140m. The words `crocodile tears' were flung across this chamber a moment ago. How can an Opposition sustain an argument that it is concerned about youth unemployment and cut by $140m labour support programs aimed at doing something to improve the prospects of young unemployed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Opposition will replace Jobstart, one of our most successful programs, with a new program with the smart name `Austrain'&mdash;a fraudulent name, I submit. This scheme will mean that young people who have been unemployed for 12 months will be made to work at 80 per cent of the award wage. The title `Austrain' suggests that this is an on the job training program for young unemployed. We are invited by the title to take that implication. But there is no clear commitment for any training to occur during the life of this program at all&mdash;none whatsoever. That is why it is fraudulently named. It is nothing more than a cheap labour scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not content with exploiting the long term unemployed, the Opposition's consumption tax package will actually worsen the employment prospects not only for youth but for all age groups. Let me demonstrate why the consumption tax package will lead to higher unemployment. The Opposition claims that with its consumption tax package it will create two million jobs&mdash;that figure was flung across the chamber by Senator Baume a moment ago. That is two million jobs by the year 2000, according to their prognostication. This claim is based on the so-called high road scenario in the Access Economics Murphy econometric model of the Australian economy, where the projections are based on the implementation of all of the recommendations of the Industry Commission reforms. This same high road scenario&mdash;these are the words we never hear from the Opposition when it is promoting its consumption tax package&mdash;requires an inflation rate of 12.4 per cent in 1994-95. Let me comment on that for a minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gerard Henderson, who formerly was John Howard's chief of staff and a senior adviser to Malcolm Fraser when he was Prime Minister and who is now a newspaper columnist, wrote in his column in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 10 December&mdash;we are hearing this from a blue chip Liberal source&mdash;referring to the employment prospects:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, the firm warranty that some 2 million jobs "will" be created and unemployment halved by the end of the century is&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>these are his blue chip Liberal words&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">just a guess. Well meaning, no doubt. Yet a hypothesis just the same. What is more, the AEM model on which this overtly optimistic promise is based does not take into account the inflationary impact of the Coalition's across-the-board goods and services tax. It is&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is again from the same source&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">all pie in the sky.</PARA>
<PARA>These are the words of the former chief of staff to John Howard, senior adviser to Malcolm Fraser, and continuing big `L' Liberal, now newspaper columnist. From within the Liberal camp comes this condemnation. How we can take it that superficial assertions flung across this chamber can be accepted? Henderson continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is a matter of record that the evidence that this expression of faith (ie two million jobs) is not to be found in almost six hundred pages of "Fightback" documentation.</PARA>
<PARA>He is saying that there is no evidence in the 600 pages of the Hewson consumption tax package which supports the contention that these jobs will be created. Even John Hewson&mdash;or Professor Hewson&mdash;does not believe his own consumption tax package will assist the unemployed. On 22 November, when referring to the so-called transition costs of his consumption tax, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . transition can involve some increases in unemployment or at least dislocation as people move from one job to another.</PARA>
<PARA>On 23 November, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm not making any promises about unemployment. There will be transition effects.</PARA>
<PARA>So at least we have an open admission, a passing honest admission, that this so-called elaborate tax will not solve the problem. Yet we have a contention here, flying in the face of what the Leader of the Opposition has said, that it will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition policies will exacerbate unemployment. What else could be the result of slashing, as it proposes, $10 billion off government expenditure? When government expenditure is being cut to the bone, cutting $10 billion out of outlays now means an attack on welfare, health, housing and education and a cut to programs that mean real things to real people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How could we get anything other than high unemployment by slashing tariffs at a quicker rate than we are proposing? What else could be the result of a 15 per cent goods and services tax that imposes an extra 15 per cent cost on goods and services? What else could be the result of a tighter monetary policy to achieve the stated target of zero inflation? All of those things, and the Murphy model on page 8 of the Murphy paper that was debated in Question Time today, demonstrate that there will be higher unemployment because of a consumption tax. So that is the promise that the Opposition in its most considered statement on the consumption tax package makes to the Australian community. It makes that promise but comes in here and talks about its concern for the unemployed. I want to contend that that is a concern not based on what the Opposition is proposing as a policy or a platform and, therefore, it must be seen as false concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn back to the question with which I started. The real figure that we are talking about in this debate is not the outrageously and emotionally presented figure from Senator Baume that is meant to start a few editorial hearts fluttering and a few headline writers grabbing for the quickest and shortest expression. It is not, as he puts in his own press release&mdash;falsely, in my contention&mdash;that there will be no jobs for more than one in three Australians. That is a false statement because the real figure is one in 10 and it behoves the Opposition not one whit to pretend that the picture is other than what it really is and present a falsity in place of fact. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter of public importance today. I do agree that we have a crisis. The rate of youth unemployment is appalling. To just say that it is high underestimates the problem that we have. However, I must first warn anyone who does happen to be listening to this today that Senator Baume's comments really should be taken with some cynicism, because he and his colleagues have had a very important role to play in making the lives of our unemployed young people even more miserable than they need to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Listeners should be aware that, despite his protestations of concern about young unemployed people, he voted with the Government to cut their incomes, thereby forcing these young people further and further into poverty, forcing them to live even further below the poverty line. This is not usually something that any of the Liberal senators make a comment on, but I believe that young unemployed people are surely entitled to ask the coalition, `If you are so concerned about our plight, why did you agree to cut our incomes?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's hypocrisy does not let the Government off the hook. It is, indeed, a damning indictment of this Government that at least one-third of young people who want to work cannot find a job. I stress that that is an average figure. In parts of Adelaide it is double that and in some country towns, such as Whyalla, it is well over that again. What do these figures say to our young people? What sort of message do they send to them about their value to our society? It is obviously not a positive message. The fact that we as a nation are not facing up to the predicament of our young people is reflected in alarming statistics about youth suicide, youth homelessness, juvenile crime and family breakdown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that young Australians are among the major victims of the recession. As a country we need to recognise that this problem of youth unemployment is not a temporary one.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young people are being squeezed out of paid full time work. There is no sign that either the coalition or the Government have any long term plans that will redress this situation. We have seen two decades of neglect by successive Federal governments and youth unemployment is now very much a long term structural problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a massive decline in teenage full time employment since 1966. Over 200,000 full time teenage jobs were lost between 1966 and 1986 and a further 100,000 jobs have been lost during the current recession. This fairly rapid disappearance of full time employment for young people has resulted in a significant increase in the number of teenagers participating in full time education, and my colleague Senator Sowada will elaborate on this in more depth. Because of this trend and a fivefold increase in part time work for young people over the last 25 years, the true level of youth unemployment is somewhat difficult to determine, but it seems reasonable to assert that many more young people than actually appear in official statistics are out there; they want to work full time and are actively trying to find a job. They are being locked out of the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Australia has basically witnessed is the elimination of what we might call entry level jobs, those jobs that, in the past, young people have been able to find and have been able to take as the first step up the ladder to entering a particular industry or profession. I refer here to a recent report by the Youth Affairs Council of South Australia entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Surplus to Requirements</EMPHASIS>, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Youth unemployment is often portrayed as a result of "high wages" and lack of skills. However, a deeper analysis reveals that fundamental structural changes, such as the participation of women in the workforce, technological innovations and changes in the organisation of work, are responsible for the collapse of the youth labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea that young wages are too high is one of the most fervently held, frequently expressed and least substantiated beliefs about young people.</PARA>
<PARA>A 1983 study by the Bureau of Labour Market Research, which claimed that an 8 per cent increase in junior award rates compared with adult rates between 1972 and 1974 has decreased youth employment, is the only substantial evidence for this view to date. This research is contradicted by an overwhelming volume of evidence. For example, the reduction in difference between adult and junior wages was greatest in the metal trades industry, yet this area provided the largest number of new teenage jobs between 1971 and 1976. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers also cite low youth skills and other negative characteristics as factors in the decline of youth full time employment. A survey commissioned by the Confederation of Australian Industry found that major employer reasons for not hiring young people included: lack of maturity, 86.5 per cent; low skill level, 82.9 per cent; and lack of relevant training, 76.2 per cent. The Opposition's quick fix proposals, as found in the Fightback package where it simply suggests that youth wages should be lowered and all will be well, certainly have absolutely no foundation whatsoever. We cannot rely on that. I stress again that the jobs young people used to do have gone. For example, we now put petrol in our own tanks when we pull into a service station. The young people who used to do those jobs have long gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young people are emerging citizens who will carry us forward to the year 2000 and beyond. We must stop acting as though our young people owe us something, that they have to keep somehow proving their worth. Instead, we as society owe them&mdash;we owe them a stake in the future; we owe them the options of education, work or training. We must also ensure that they have a secure income&mdash;not an income dependent upon walking the streets, having to prove week after week that nobody wants them, that there is not a place for them in the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our social security system is not coping and cannot cope with these long term problems of structural change. It cannot cope with the new needs of young people who find themselves locked out of the labour market in the long term. We need a fresh approach. We need a new look at the situation. I await with interest tonight's statement in the hope that we will really see some changes for young people. We cannot afford to ignore their needs. We cannot leave them with no hope; we cannot leave them without any opportunity to fulfil their dreams. I hope that we will hear tonight of new long term proposals to ensure that young people have access to work, to education or to training with an assured income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress some of the jobs that have been lost. I refer again to the report of the Youth Affairs Council which states that we no longer need mail deliverers, receptionists, telephone operators, messengers and electricians in the numbers that we needed before. We now have fax machines; we now have centralised exchanges. In our manufacturing industries we have automated testing and computerised surveillance. Architecture has also been, to a large extent, computerised. We do not need process workers, draft persons or technicians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In publishing, we no longer need a lot of printers and typesetters. We have computerised printing and typesetting. Retailing and banking has seen another large number of reductions in the work force. We do not need as many bookkeepers, tellers or cashiers&mdash;all jobs that in the past have been held by young people. We have computerised accounting and automatic teller machines. In our offices we see photocopiers and word processors. Some offices and cafe bars have no need for tea ladies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I want to stress that these jobs have gone in the long term. We need structural change to ensure that our young people are guaranteed education, work or training with a secure income. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Until the last few days I had thought that there could be no greater indictment of a government than its failed policies in relation to offering employment to those in the nation who want to work, and particularly not being able to offer employment to young people seeking work. It seemed that the greatest indictment that one could make of a government was to claim that its policies had failed to result in a situation where people who wanted a job could actually get one. We now find that we have about one million Australians, many of them very young, who have no hope, no job and no access to tertiary education. They see themselves as being at the end of the line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last couple of days my colleague Senator Baume has alerted me to a situation that many would regard as much worse than so many Australians, especially young Australians, being out of a job. He has alerted me to the fact that the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) is not so much turning a blind eye to this problem but is actually manufacturing figures which give a false impression and are quite deceptive. That is worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it intolerable for a government to generate policies that leave Australians, especially young Australians, without jobs. But it is even more intolerable for it to then engage in some sort of statistical mishmash and pretend that the problem is not as bad as it really is. That is the ultimate disgrace. Australians are entitled to expect honesty from their government. Perhaps the history since 1983 has lowered the expectations of Australians in that respect. I am sorry that that is so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that Senator Baume has been making quite ably is simply this: when we talk about the percentage of unemployed we all know that we are talking about the percentage of people who want to get a job but who cannot do so. Obviously, we do not refer to retired Australians over 65 years of age as being unemployed and looking for work&mdash;that would be meaningless. When we talk about the percentage of unemployment, we talk about the percentage of people who cannot get a job and who are in fact looking for work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook came in here today and sought to defend Minister Baldwin for coming up with an unemployment rate that shows the number of unemployed as a percentage not of those in the work force&mdash;that is, those looking for work&mdash;but of all people in that age group, whether they are looking for work or not. It is no defence at all for Senator Cook to come in here today and say, `Oh well, it is a bit different for young people&mdash;a lot of them are in education and that is a factor in relation to the youth labour market'. It is not. The people in full time education are not in the youth labour market&mdash;it is quite separate; it is irrelevant. So, we have this disastrous situation, made worse by a government trying to pretend that it is not as bad as it really is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support some of the remarks made by the Minister. I am pleased that more young Australians are going into higher education or are spending longer in their secondary education. But that does not change the percentage of people who are not going on to further secondary education or tertiary education, who are looking for a job and who now cannot get one. It is another irrelevant argument in relation to the people that Senator Baume's matter of public importance is directed at; that is, the young Australians who want to get a job and who simply cannot do so. It is true to say that one in three of those young Australians&mdash;perhaps even closer to one in two&mdash;cannot get a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a disastrous situation. The situation is far worse than the figures show and Senator Baume has outlined that perfectly adequately. He has indicated that discouraged job seekers are not included in some of the unemployment figures. Nor is the level of underemployment revealed in the unemployment figures. We have a Minister trying to pretend that in fact the situation is far better than the figures show and that is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We could stand here for hours and argue about the best way to refer to this situation statistically, but we would be wasting our time if we did so. There must be some common agreement that the situation at the moment is unacceptable. Surely, between all of us, we have some common ground in that respect. It is plainly unacceptable. People who are unemployed do not care what the unemployment rate is&mdash;they are 100 per cent unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation is hitting young Australians, the private sector and women&mdash;especially older women&mdash;and I am pleased that the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, so graciously condescends to tell us that he is concerned about all unemployed as though there were something wrong with us in directing our attention to the plight of young Australians. We are all concerned about those people who want to work and cannot get a job. We clearly understand that this disastrous recession, which we were not going to have and then suddenly needed to have, is affecting young Australians, the private sector and women&mdash;especially older woman who are simply giving up. But surprise, surprise, it does not appear to be affecting the public sector; they are not feeling the pinch at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed earlier that Senator Harradine was listening to this debate. He has had a longstanding interest in youth unemployment and, in particular, he has had a longstanding interest in the failure of the Australian Public Service to take and train its fair share of young Australians. I am sorry that he is not on the speaking list today because I would have been interested to hear what he would have had to say on this matter. What this Government has been doing in fact is fiddling while Rome burns. We have had promises, promises, promises in relation to employment or unemployment and the Government has been very short on delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, I take you back to five or six years ago when this Government spent hundred of thousands of dollars&mdash;I am not talking about $100,000 or $200,000; more likely $300,000 or $400,000&mdash;advertising that young Australians were its No. 1 priority. You might remember the Priority One: Young Australia scheme. Young Australians were going to have Australian traineeships. I think there were going to be 75,000 of them in our bicentennial year, according to the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. I think we got up to about 7,000 in that year, which put his promises at about 10c in the dollar. Of course, I would not give you that much on his promises in any event, but that is what the figures showed the promises were worth: 75,000 trainees in our bicentennial year and we ended up with about 7,000 or 8,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time I remember seeing a cartoon and I have never forgotten it. It had Bob Hawke sitting at a table with a carpenter's file filing his nails, because the slogan for Priority One was, `Youth of Australia, you are our No. 1 priority'. The slogan at the bottom of that cartoon was, `Youth of Australia, priority two&mdash;don't call us; we'll call you'. The youth of Australia have been waiting for the call for a job, and they have not got it yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight we will no doubt hear some other extraordinary concoction of policies, and we will yet again pretend to young Australians that there is some opportunity being created for them by this Government; and yet again they will be let down. That is a disastrous situation for us to be facing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn to some of the things that we could do. I listened with interest to Senator Lees because she and I have some common understanding in relation to certain aspects of her remarks on youth unemployment. But we differ in a number of areas, and I would like to give some attention to those at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could give a couple of hints to the Government. First of all, it has to get the economy healthy so that the real jobs are there. There is no point in the Australian Democrats talking about how much we pay the unemployed and what we are going to do with this unemployed person or this unemployment training scheme if we do not address the basic problem of generating more real jobs. We can put as many bandaids as we like on those who are unemployed; it will not help the problem if at the end of the day we do not give them a real job. The Democrats should be concentrating on the policies being proposed by the parties&mdash;that is, the Fightback package and those policies practised by this Government since 1983. Let us not be fooled by any tinkering at the edges that goes on tonight. This lot has been in government since 1983. They want to choose between the results that have come about through the policies of these people over here and the alternative package that we offer and should not be misled, as I say, by this tinkering at the edges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the aspects that we offer of particular interest to young Australians&mdash;I am sorry that Senator Lees is not here because she might have some interjections that she might like to make on these remarks&mdash;is the opportunity for genuine enterprise bargaining; that is, for people who work in a factory to make an arrangement with their boss in respect of that factory. If the factory is down at Millicent in South Australia, they do not want to have the award for that task be set in Sydney in some industrial commission by a whole lot of QCs who are paid far more than we or anybody in the gallery will ever get a sniff at. It is much better for an agreement to be reached on something that suits that factory down at the workplace level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might find one factory in South Australia, through mismanagement or bad luck with one of their big customers, going broke or for whatever reason in financial strife. We might find another factory on the other side of South Australia doing fairly well within the same award. Those workers in the factory that is battling, for whatever reason, should have the chance to keep their jobs by being able to make rearrangements. Similarly, the workers in the factory that is going really well should be able to share in the benefits of that and get over-award payments without running the risk of a wage spiral going through the whole economy. If it is their work, their effort and their conscientiousness that has made that factory go, and go well, they should get some benefit of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees says that there is not much evidence to show that young Australians are being priced out of jobs. I note that she referred to the metal trades industry. She indicated that that industry has taken on a very significant proportion of young Australians, despite the fact that the disparity between adult and youth wages has not been that large. She says that that puts paid to the argument that young Australians are priced out of jobs. It is really not that simple. Senator Lees is forgetting the type of work that is available in the metal trades industry. The work has not changed as drastically as the work that is available in other industries. There are still more jobs available there for younger, less well trained people than there are in other industries. It is just not a simple situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees should put herself in the position of having a small factory where she has five men or women working who are, say, 22 years old with some experience in whatever the industry is and she wants to take on another person. She should ask herself whether she is going to take on an 18 year old at full adult rates with no experience and sack one of the 23 year olds who has, say, four or five years experience. The simple answer to that is no, she will not do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people have to have a chance; they have to be able to be above a minimum level. The coalition and I understand that. Our industrial relations policy provides for a minimum award rate so that people cannot be&mdash;I think the terminology is&mdash;screwed down by unscrupulous employers. We will not allow that to happen. But we do want young Australians to be able to say, `Look, I will take $20 less a week if I can keep my job'. I think plenty of young Australians out there on the dole queue of a million or more would very much like the opportunity to make their own negotiation with their employer; to offer to work for a bit less in the beginning to get the experience and to then make themselves a valuable employee who the boss cannot afford to dismiss because of the experience they have gained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees spoke of giving more dollars to the young unemployed and why do we cut the money to young unemployed. Without addressing the point, that question in one sense is irrelevant. It is irrelevant in the sense of what does one do to make real jobs for these people to turn them from being unemployed into being employed. Senator Lees wanted to talk about what money you give to the unemployed. I want to talk about how to turn them into employed people so that they get a decent wage and a wage that they feel they themselves have earned rather than a constant handout from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last but not least, I note that the Democrats say that we need a fresh approach, a new look at this problem. But I do not hear any ideas from them as to what to do with it. In contrast to that, of course, the coalition's Fightback package will take off payroll tax, fuel excise and wholesale sales tax off business inputs. That takes the tax man's hand out of the business pocket. It makes business more efficient and gives it the opportunity to employ more Australians&mdash;and, it follows from that, young Australians. In conclusion, let me say that some honourable senators on the other side do not seem to understand that a GST will not increase prices by 15 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are discussing a matter of public importance from Senator Michael Baume which talks about the Government's dishonest attempt to pretend that the real youth unemployment rate is less than the adult rate. Let us look at what the Minister actually said in his press release. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The real percentage of young people genuinely seeking full time work and who are unable to find it is 8.8%.</PARA>
<PARA>What he is saying is that the number of young people seeking full time work relative to the total youth population is 8.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 30 per cent figure represents the number of unemployed young people in the full time labour force. It is as simple as that. That is the least important issue in debate, although I agree with Senator Cook that, under this Government, from April 1983 to January 1992 teenage full time unemployment seasonally adjusted fell by 40,600, or 25.8 per cent, and the proportion of the teenage population unemployed and seeking full time unemployment fell from 12.3 to 8.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say only one other thing about the haggling over figures that has occurred. Senator Baume was upset about the heading of a press release dated 16 February, which boasted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No jobs for more than 1 in 3 young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>It is clearly misleading. All I would say to Senator Baume is that he is a journalist and he knows that the heading often is the most important part of any communication, and that is a clearly misleading heading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are saying does not change the number of young people looking for jobs who are unable to find them. No-one on this side of the Parliament thinks that the current level of youth unemployment is satisfactory. The real question is: whose policies will create jobs for young people seeking work and whose policies will ensure that there are measures in place to assist young people during this difficult time of high unemployment? The dispute over figures highlights a greater difference between the Government and the Opposition. I hope to deal with that contrast of policies, as I acknowledge that other people have attempted to. I certainly take up the challenge of Senator Vanstone to argue that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government believes that young people are the important next generation of our work force. The Government is concerned to ensure equity amongst young people through the youth social justice strategy, which targets disadvantaged young people in particular. Of course, we say that, by contrast, the coalition's package will not do that. We believe that a work force must be educated and skilled. The basic layer of education and skill that underpins the work force has been raised by this Government during its period of office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young people today have far greater access to education and training, be it through TAFE, universities, workplace-based training or labour market programs. That has occurred under this Government, in sharp contrast to our Liberal predecessors. It is no wonder that the Opposition does not want to acknowledge in its calculations the increased number of young people remaining at school or in post-secondary education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Lees has indicated, technological and organisational change over the past 20 years has meant that many jobs that have traditionally been entry level positions have disappeared. Senator Lees reminded me of what has happened in the printing industry. I have had a long association with the printing, paper and metals industries, and all I can say is that, since I entered the printing industry in the 1950s, there have been dramatic changes in the prospects of young people. In general, traditional jobs are going or have gone. We as a government have been actively acknowledging that that is happening and have concentrated our emphasis on post-secondary education. The Whitlam Government, the Hawke Government and now the Keating Government have allocated massive resources into that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about `value adding', a phrase that is now very commonly used. It is a very frequently used phrase that is perfectly appropriate. In industry, value added management and total quality control are used to denote the integration of advanced management technology and management systems. It is an issue of major cooperation in manufacturing industry. This Government, in its commitment to education and training, has value added to our human capital. That is a contrast with the Liberal governments of the past and with the package that the Liberal and National parties have for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The runs are on the board as far as this Government is concerned. The retention rate in secondary schools has gone from one-third under the Fraser Government to two-thirds under Labor. As Minister Cook has said, in March about 66 per cent of the entire teenage population will be in some form of education and training, attending school or tertiary full time study. With adjustments, that leaves about 28 per cent of the teenage population in the labour force. That contrasts with what is happening overseas. When one compares this record with that of the Fraser Government and the Menzies Government&mdash;one can take any of the conservative governments in that whole period of conservative control&mdash;one can see that they were characterised by inertia in this area. It is very difficult for Opposition speakers to talk about what this Government is doing when it has such a poor record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government is now moving to the next phase of adding value to our human capital in TAFE and universities right across the country. This reflects the Government's concern that Australia should not face the long term skills shortages that occurred after the 1982-83 recession we inherited. The Government will provide more than $13 billion for universities over the 1992-94 triennium and will create almost 35,000 new places for Australian students, making a total of 85,000 new places since 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1992 funding includes an extra $9.7m in operating grants and $24 million in research funds and an additional $70m in capital funding to help alleviate overcrowding problems. Arising out of the November employment statement, there is an additional $34m funding package for new technical and further education in New South Wales, the home State of Senator Baume and myself. In practice, the Greiner Liberal Government's contribution to educating young people in my State has been to allow the TAFE system to deteriorate. This funding will provide the equivalent of an extra 15,000 full time places in New South Wales in 1992. The Government has also announced a $33m package of incentives to expand apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities and to save existing jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government does not play a role only through the formal higher education mechanism, and this is one of the contrasts. It also has a range of labour market programs that time and time again have proven to be effective in retraining people and enhancing their prospects of finding a job. The training component of programs such as Jobtrain, Jobskills, Jobsearch training and Jobstart is clearly the key element of their success. I will later show that the coalition's program does not have that training component that is a characteristic of this Government's training programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister has pointed out, the industry is supportive of the Government's belief that training and further education are the key to young people's futures. The integration of better educated and trained young people into the work force has occurred under this Government and the training and broadbanding of skills has occurred in industry after industry. That is the other side of the integration of education and industry that has occurred under this Government. It lays the basis, as we move out of the recession, for ensuring that the employment people have will be career employment, whether in traditional careers or in industries that, until this Government came along, were not career based industries at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it interesting that we have the Opposition professing its concern for young people when, as Senator Cook has said, the only attempt in the document detailing the Fightback package to address the needs of at risk young people is a statement that the coalition would help young people to make the transition from school to further training. Apart from a reference to the end of automatic entitlement to the Jobsearch allowance after nine months, there is no further mention made in the document to disadvantaged young people. But this applies to everyone; in other words, young people will be disadvantaged in exactly the same way as older people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the specific proposals of the Fightback package to show how young people would be affected under the coalition. Labour market program expenditure will be reduced by $140m. That is horrendous. By replacing Jobstart with Austrain, abolishing the self-employment assistance program and cutting Jobtrain, Austrain will be a wage subsidy program where the subsidy is paid to the unemployed person in the form of below award wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have just heard Senator Vanstone advance the ideology of the coalition. She said that people could take $20 a week less. In other words, she is saying that it is fair enough to give the employer untrammelled rights in an enterprise bargaining arrangement. Of course, the coalition puts forward this enterprise union nonsense. What this would really do is smash unions. How would a young person, who bowls up to an employer in an industry which has no award laying down minimum standards, get into employment? Indeed, in principle Austrain is a below award arrangement which undermines the rates in a particular industry or field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Vanstone said in her example that a person might take a cut of $20 to help out his employer, as it were. What the coalition ignores is that the good employer who is doing the right thing will be forced by a direct rival to cut wages because of market competition. In no time flat, the person who is disadvantaged will be the younger person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what young people face is not only the abolition of the CES and youth access centres under a coalition government but also a whole system designed to make it difficult for them to get training. Once again, that contrasts with the situation under this Government of a whole system of training, cooperatively agreed between all the principals of an industry. What people face under the coalition is the offer of a jungle&mdash;the power of a jungle against young people. I believe that we have to look past the immediate problems. Tonight we will solve many of those problems. When we consider the future of Australia, we must recognise that we need planning and industry agreement. We do not want the coalition's jungle. </PARA>

Anybody with any intelligence at all knows perfectly well that the youth unemployment rate in this country is far higher than the overall unemployment rate.

On that basis, what Mr Baldwin is saying is a bald admission that every single person aged 15 to 19 years who is in education or who is in part-time work is really seeking full-time work. That in itself is a damming indictment of this Government's failed policies. If Mr Baldwin's statement is correct, then very clearly we have a massive problem with the underemployed, the people who cannot get a full-time job and have to make do with a part-time job; the people who aspire to have a decent standard of living yet who, under this Government's policy, have been condemned to a lifetime of penury.

Certainly, there are a number of measures in it that will contain Government expenditure, such as the saving of an alleged $160m by amalgamating the Commonwealth Employment Service with the Department of Social Security and privatising or contracting out the job placement activities of the Commonwealth Employment Service. However, the Opposition overlooks the fact that Australia's Commonwealth Employment Service is by far and away one of the world's best government bureaucracies in terms of placing people in employment. Nonetheless, for the sake of saving $160m, the Commonwealth Employment Service will be wiped out. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's Austrain program, part of its proposal to slash wages, is elaborated on in the Fightback package. The document states that after six months of unemployment an employer will be able to offer a job at 90 per cent of award rates or other equivalent minimum to an unemployed person, provided that that person has been unemployed for six months. After 12 months that job offer could be made at 80 per cent of the minimum award rate. If one followed that scenario through to the end, one would see that a person who had been unemployed for five years could be offered a job at nil rates of pay. Indeed, I think that if the Opposition ever regained the treasury bench we would find that it would certainly be going down that track. The difficulty we have got with the Fightback package is that it has been developed by New Right think tanks which have sprung up around Australia in recent years.

I have not completely studied the article, nor have I had the opportunity to study Senator Baume's figures which were incorporated in his speech earlier this afternoon, so I will not comment.

Therefore, if one uses a real life situation and applies it to Senator Baume's argument&mdash;an argument which he has put to the Australian media by way of a press release on 16 February this year&mdash;there is absolutely no way that it will stand up when one considers real human beings rather than just figures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am certainly hopeful that there will be genuine jobs. It depends on the definition of what a genuine job is. Is being an Opposition senator in this place a genuine job? I would argue that it is, but I would argue that many of those opposite do not do their jobs particularly well. In raising matters such as Opposition members have raised this afternoon, they have not made a tremendous contribution to undertaking a genuine job. If it is a genuine job and we are serious about cutting salaries, why pick on the unemployed and particularly youth unemployed? Why lop 10 per cent or 20 per cent off their income? I ask those opposite why they do not start with themselves because they do not deserve the salaries that are being paid to them at the moment. Opposition members are hardly laying a glove on the Government and that is part of the reason, I suggest, why youth unemployment and unemployment are as high as they are today.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The new poor in Australia are the young. The growing underclass is unemployed young Australians, many of whom are unskilled, inexperienced and in desperate need of training opportunities. The new poor are found on the streets of Kings Cross in Sydney, on the beaches of St Kilda in Melbourne, in the urban sprawl of Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney and throughout the country. They have been betrayed by this Government which promised that no child would live in poverty by 1990. I defy any Minister to walk through Kings Cross and look at the child prostitutes, the street kids and the hopeless ones in the eye. The obscenity of the ex-Prime Minister's salary, payments for interviews and other perks are in stark contrast to the legacy of young unemployed people struggling to survive on only a piddling $62.05 per week two years after he made that audacious promise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest unemployment statistics, which record a massive youth unemployment rate of 30 per cent, sanitise the human misery and the destruction of our most valuable resource, the idealism of young people, hope and belief in their future and the future of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Senate must consider the socially and economically disastrous effects of these record levels of youth unemployment. The Government has an obligation to provide solutions; such an important task cannot be left up to the `invisible hand' of market forces. The figures paper over this misery by understating the huge level of youth unemployment. We cannot begin to imagine how many young people are actually out of work, as the Australian Bureau of Statistics deems employment to be anyone working one paid hour for profit or pay during a survey week, including cases where they worked one hour in a family business. A large number of younger workers have lost their jobs as a result of the recession, but not all are joining the dole queue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen enormous changes in the workplace over the past 10 years. New technology has made redundant many low skilled labour intensive jobs which traditionally soaked up young people and school students who left the system before completion of their studies. The retail sector, normally a large employer of young people, has been badly hit by the recession and job opportunities have shrunk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no longer possible for students to leave school before completing year 12 and expect to obtain decent employment opportunities. The changing nature of the workplace means that employers need skilled workers who can perform a variety of tasks. A young school leaver with no qualifications simply cannot compete in this kind of environment when the job market contracts. Hence, enhanced training and education opportunities must be offered to young people. But what we have seen is an inability of the education system to cope with these new demands. This is evidenced by as many as 50,000 university applicants and up to 100,000 TAFE applicants who missed out on places this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that we are, according to Minister Beazley, `comparatively generous' in our education provision is not a reason to continually decrease our spending on education and training but is every reason to promote it and expand it to its traditionally high standards. Countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development such as France, Germany and Sweden are leading the way with additional funds for education, training and research. Australia's spending on education is below one per cent of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review into post-compulsory education, known as the Finn review, recommends that 95 per cent of all 19 year olds will be in either higher education or the work force with a certificate of some kind by the year 2001. This commendable target will not be met by the Government unless we see a commitment of up to $5 billion injected into the TAFE sector, as suggested by the Ramsay review into TAFE. A major expansion in TAFE facilities would help ensure that our young people are qualified for their futures and ensure a better future for this country. But this Government has rewarded the aspirations of our youth with limited access to education and training, increased living costs and rocketing unemployment levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employment for young people not only means the ability to sustain themselves and often their dependants, but it also represents a step towards independence and self-respect. This self-respect is the lifeblood of the clever country. The Government has bled this dry with its economic rationalist policies that have resulted, according to former Minister Clyde Cameron, in `nothing short of a social tragedy'. In reality, what this Government offers the youth of today is no jobs and no hope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can only hope that tonight's economic statement from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) offers recovery in the form of increased expenditure for further education and training programs for young Australians. We would hope to see some direction given to Australia's faltering apprenticeship schemes so that the skills base so necessary for Australia's economic development is nurtured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can we claim to be the clever country when so many students cannot gain access to universities or colleges of technical and further education and those that do are in institutions that are overcrowded, have substandard facilities and have to support themselves on Austudy payments below the poverty line?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's panacea for youth unemployment, the idea to cut youth wages by 20 per cent, is confirmation of a belief that young people have little to offer this country, yet their services are available to those who want to exploit them for the benefit of profit margins. The coalition's policy would create an underclass of unemployed young people with no incentives and no self-respect. When combined with their scorched earth industrial relations policy, this is a recipe for exploitation and the kind of developments which have emerged in New Zealand. For example, under the New Zealand employment contracts legislation there have been a number of examples that have emerged in recent months which have shown that real exploitation is the result of a totally deregulated labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a couple of examples. One is of an 18-year-old who worked in a takeaway bar on three months probation for $30 a day. She was then hired full time for five 12-hour days per week, still for $30 a day, or $2.50 per hour. The old award minimum rate was $7.15 an hour for a 40-hour week for a kitchen hand. As another example, a 16-year-old took a job at a rest home, signing a contract for a flat rate of $6.30 an hour, with no extra loading for overtime. Some time later she found herself working up to 10 hours a day, seven days a week for the same hourly rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> recently there was an advertisement extolling the virtues of the New Zealand economic situation as a new location for industry. It said that the recent Employment Contracts Act had abolished industrial awards, leaving employers free to negotiate terms of employment for a labour cost saving of up to 25 per cent. I point out that labour cost saving is not just a bottom line figure that appears on someone's balance sheets. It means a 25 per cent reduction in real wages for workers. That is what we would have in Australia under a flat earth industrial relations policy, and young workers in non-unionised sectors of the economy would be hit very severely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians need to look very closely at the kinds of policies that are being promoted and the kind of deregulated labour market promoted by both the Opposition and the Government. It is vital that adequate safety nets be provided for workers, especially young workers, to ensure that they do not fall below the poverty line in a grab by employers simply to offer lower wages to workers as the labour market contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a prevalent notion that the reduction of youth wages will provide increased employment opportunities for the young. The theory goes that young people receive lower wages than adult workers on the basis that they have different levels of experience and different social and economic needs. These assumptions require re-examination, as young people nowadays often acquire the responsibilities that come with adulthood, such as being responsible for themselves and often dependants without adult status. Governments are quick to recognise adult responsibilities that come with adulthood, such as voting, the age of consent and the right to drink. Yet most awards with junior pay rates do not give adult wages to under-21-year-olds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost to Australia in terms of lost skills cannot be measured and the cost to the taxpayer has not been determined. Youth homelessness has not been substantially reduced, with up to 30 per cent increases in the number of children haunting Kings Cross. This Government must recognise its responsibilities in the area of training and education as a major way of helping improve the job prospects of young people. </PARA>

<PARA>I congratulate the Australian Institute of Marine Science on its annual report for the year 1990-91. Queensland can be proud of the fact that such a worthwhile institute is in Townsville in north Queensland. The work the Institute does in undertaking research and development in order to generate knowledge in marine science and technology and to promote its application in industry and government is vital to the healthy maintenance of our vast coastal areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Queenslander, I am particularly keen on the vital work it does, especially in the north of the State on the vast expanses of the Great Barrier Reef. Those honourable senators who have travelled to north Queensland, as you have, Mr Deputy President, will know what a wonderful tourist attraction the Great Barrier Reef is. People go there to scuba dive and snorkel. There is a great marlin fishing season around September each year on the Barrier Reef. On one occasion I tried diving underneath a boat out from Lizard Island. I am afraid that I am not very good; I am nothing like a good scuba diver. I managed to get down just far enough to have a look at the big spotted cod that were there and I realised that there are many marvellous fish on the reef. I prefer to look at the reef through a glass-bottom boat. It is certainly a much easier way of seeing the wonders of the reef, as far as I am concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must ensure that the many tourists who go there do not damage the reef. At low tide a lot of tourists go out and look at the wonders of the reef, and that is very important. In this report the Chairman notes that the scientific highlights in the area in the past five years included a number of research projects. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The institute's crown-of-thorns study continued and helped to allay many of the fears that the infestation would destroy the Great Barrier Reef.</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Work on coral density banding provided information about coral growth over long time periods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The institute found evidence for a decline in coral growth in the last few decades in the central and northern sections of the Great Barrier Reef.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, longer growth records show that such declines have occurred in the past.</PARA>
<PARA>I think I could say the same about the crown of thorns starfish, which at different times has infested the reef. I can remember many occasions while my husband was Premier when authorities were worried that the reef would be utterly destroyed by the crown of thorns starfish. Then nature seemed to revive the reef and the plague disappeared for some time. It comes and goes. That is one of the things with nature&mdash;one just does not know how these things happen. On page 35 the report points out that the Institute has been conducting surveys of the crown of thorns starfish and corals over much of the Great Barrier Reef since 1985. I believe that God has made a wonderful world, and I class the Great Barrier Reef as the eighth wonder of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 29 the report talks about cyclone Ivor and the effects of tropical cyclones on the Great Barrier Reef. Often the cyclones come down that way and affect it. I have also noted&mdash;as you would know, Mr Deputy President&mdash;the number of times people complain about the road that was built through the Daintree forest to Cooktown. I always felt that was a very important road for the people who live in Cooktown. I once travelled right around the back road to get to Cooktown. It was a terrible road and very long. They talked about the damage to the reef from that road. We can see that the reef manages to rehabilitate itself from time to time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to speak to the report of the Australian Institute of Marine Science. It does not seem to occur to many Australians what a huge and vast coastline we have and how much the sea is part of our livelihood. We are not a maritime country; we do not think of the sea as being important, and this is an area that must change. In changing that view, it is appropriate that we should spend more on and become more involved in marine research. This Institute is doing that in a very practical way at Townsville. We have some great marine scientists, not only at the Institute but in other places as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So many Australians know nothing about the Institute. Regrettably, even Australians who get as far as Townsville very seldom find their way to the Institute. It does not get nearly enough publicity for the work it does, so very few people find out about it through normal media processes. It is doing wonderful work. The work that it is doing and the people who are doing it receive praise from all around the world. In particular, the work of the Director, Dr Joe Baker, receives special recognition. He speaks at various conferences and groups in all parts of the world. He is very highly regarded and we are extremely fortunate to have a man of that calibre able and willing to look after the Institute in Townsville. I occasionally see Dr Baker when he comes to Canberra. I always find him a fascinating person to talk to and the projects that the Institute is undertaking are most exciting. I was interested to learn from the report that its five-year plan has just concluded and it has started on the next one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work that is being done by the Institute covers a variety of areas. It is mainly the work that is done on the Barrier Reef that most people know about. That is not all it does by any means. It is not only the crown-of-thorns starfish that is important; the corals themselves are important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that this organisation has taken a lot of trouble to allay some of the fears that people have. It is very easy to follow the type of line that tells us that everything is bad, we have problems galore and it will only get worse. I have just come from a discussion. Talk about distortion and destruction!  We heard nothing but half-truths on another matter. I am very pleased that the Institute of Marine Science at least provides comfort to people as far as the quality and quantity of the corals are concerned and the fact that the crown-of-thorns starfish will not be the be-all and end-all&mdash;particularly the end-all&mdash;of the Reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The research that the Institute has done into climatic conditions through the effects on the corals over a period of 250 years is most important to Australia and does a lot to tell us the life of the area over that period. The Institute has carried out research into the coastal ecosystems, the mangroves and all the fish that live and breed amongst the mangroves. To many people, mangroves are a nuisance and an encumbrance towards development. They form a very important part of the Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by paying tribute to Dr Farrands who held the chairmanship of the Institute from 1982 to 1990.

<PARA>I would like to place on record the Opposition's congratulations to the Chairperson of the Australian Sports Drug Agency, former Senator Peter Baume, Professor Peter Baume, on being recognised on Australia Day, among others, by his receiving of the Order of Australia. There is no doubt in all our minds that he was a very worthy recipient of that recognition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to chide my cousin in his report to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) covering this annual report because no date is reproduced on the letter to indicate on which day it was sent by Professor Baume, as Chairperson, to the Minister. The reason I am concerned about this is that this report is being presented in this chamber late in February when a draft of it was presented to us in the September Senate Estimates Committee. It is incredible that even though this report was basically available&mdash;not in its final state but certainly in draft form&mdash;it is finally brought into this chamber towards the end of February. That is just not good enough; it is ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pressed the Australian Sports Drug Agency at the time of the Senate Estimates as to when it expected its annual report to be presented to the Senate. At that time, the slot time&mdash;almost like aircraft arrivals&mdash;given by AGPS appeared to be November at the earliest. At that stage it had not received the Auditor-General's certificate. I now note from the annual report that the Auditor's certificate was received on 25 October. Even though the Senate sat until 21 December, it could not get this report into this Parliament by then. This is grossly inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not blaming the Australian Sports Drug Agency. On the contrary, I congratulated it at the time for giving us the draft report. I recognise, however, that its expectation that the Auditor's report would be available within a few weeks of 9 September did not come to fruition. I see that the Auditor's report is dated 25 October. It is still unacceptable that it takes so long for reporting to take place from government bodies, particularly an important one such as this. This report has a lot of significant material in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understood from the Department at the time of Senate Estimates, it is obliged to do all this through the Australian Government Publishing Service. As Mr Blunn said, it is like getting into a queue for printing, which can cause significant delays. That queue for printing is unreasonably and improperly delaying the presentation of a whole host of reports to this Parliament. This is a classic example of how that takes place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many matters relating to the Australian Sports Drug Agency which I do not want to raise now because we will be dealing with amendments to its Act shortly. It seems extraordinary that some of those amendments have to be made so recently after the Act was passed, including, for example, making the Sports Drug Agency exempt from sales tax. One would have thought that that would be an obvious part of the original legislation, but it was not to be. We will deal with the matters of substance when that legislation comes up. In the meantime, I hope that the Australian Government Publishing Service and DASET itself can do something to speed up this quite unsatisfactory situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to speak to the annual report of the Australian Sports Drug Agency. I am very unhappy to have listened to Senator Michael Baume's contribution. I am very happy to support him in his remarks about his cousin and I sincerely hope his cousin, who is no longer in this place, takes him aside at the next weekend and speaks to him sternly about this tedious complaining about timing and dates. We have already reported this matter at length in the report on annual reports, which is one of the more splendidly preoccupying reports in this place. It is a matter that has already been very strenuously addressed; it is a matter that really is not of concern to be associated with a report. It ought to be taken up with the Australian Government Publishing Service. I think it is a big distraction from the points at issue in this report that could be more seriously addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the report says, the ASDA was established under the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990 on 18 February 1991. The Agency operated as an interim organisation within the DASETT portfolio from 1 July 1990 until 18 February 1991 when it was separately established. The report lists its aims, objectives and corporate priorities. These include, particularly, encouraging not only the testing of drugs which is obviously part of its responsibilities, but also enhancing the climate in this country where drugs in sport are regarded as&mdash;`unfavourable' is probably a useful word&mdash;totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the Agency quite clearly continues the work of the so-called Black Report handed down by the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and Arts drugs in sport inquiry. I believe my colleague Senator Crichton-Browne, as a member of that committee of inquiry, will have some words to say about that shortly. This Agency continues to foster the climate of attitude that was created by that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there would be no disagreement now in this country that the use of drugs in sport is cheating. While it is still clear that it continues in some places, the testing has meant that more and more people are aware that they are likely to get caught if they do not change their attitudes. I think there is a community perception and awareness that using drugs in sport is cheating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 16 of the annual report there is reference to a caffeine study and the research work being done by the Australian Sports Drug Agency, jointly funded with the Australian Sports Commission, to investigate the pharmacokinectics of caffeine ingestion and elimination. This is of particular relevance because of an inquiry that is currently being conducted by the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, of which I am Chair. That Committee should be reporting within the next couple of weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of caffeine has certainly taxed our minds and those of many others besides. I am very pleased to see reference in the report to the fact that considerable research has already been done. The results of the study are not available, at least they were not at the time of printing. Hopefully, we will get those very soon. Quite clearly, while there are significant consequences for people who are found to have caffeine levels above the levels regarded as prescribed levels, there is a very great difference from individual to individual about how those levels might be reached. Given the seriousness of the consequences, it is very important that we endorse this part of the report that looks at adequate research so that we can make better decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also interested to note that the Agency undertook a literature review based research study looking at the effects of marijuana which was found, we understand, when testing some sports people in this country. It is very interesting to note that the report says that the literature shows that the effect of marijuana was to reduce rather than enhance sports performance. I would have thought it was necessary for the Agency to give us clear definitions of why drugs are proscribed. If they are to be proscribed because of performance enhancement, then there will be a need for a rethink in the area of marijuana. If we want to proscribe them because of ethical decisions, moral values or something of that sort, that can be done, but that needs to be distinguished from whether they are performance enhancing. If the Sports Drug Agency is focusing on a rethink as to whether marijuana is performance enhancing, an elaboration of the debate about whether marijuana belongs on that list should be made available to the full community. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I observe that this year, of those Australian athletes who were tested for drugs, 71 were found to be cheats. I note that the self-confessed cheat, Martin Vinnicombe, is now taking action in the Federal Court of New South Wales, under restraint of trade, as I recall, against the Australian Sports Drug Agency for what appears to be a technicality. I do not want to comment on the litigation, of course, other than to say that it involves the Australian Professional Cycling Association, an association that will not have access to large funding. I hope that the penalty the Association has imposed on Mr Vinnicombe is not compromised because of its financial inability to contest the litigation in the courts. I hope the Government will give thought, in view of the circumstances, to seeing that that body has appropriate funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that in the last 12 months three German athletes have been banned, together with the coach of one of those athletes, for allegedly being involved in what is described as urine substitution. One of the athletes was the winner of the 100 metres women's championship at the recent competition. It would appear on the evidence thus far available which has lead to their four-year bans that they were banned because it is alleged that their urine was substituted for somebody else's for testing purposes. In fact, the same person's urine was used on each occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are now very serious penalties for this type of action. I well recall the uproar that I caused when I raised the issue of Jane Fleming and an official of Australia being involved in exactly the same thing. This case involving the German athletes shows that this situation is not unique and it shows that the world has a very strong view which is illustrated by the penalties that were imposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report shows us that there is still a high use of anabolic steroids and, while it is not shown, I suspect that there is a use of human growth hormones. While I do not want to make any quantitative judgments about it at the moment, I think evidence will prevail in due course that will show that there is an active trade in the use of these drugs in Australia. There have been detections at the customs barrier of illegal importations of both veterinary and human growth hormones for improper purposes, and the importation of anabolic steroids for improper purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that evidence will show that it is a flourishing trade. I am sure it will show that the industry of peddling these drugs is rife in Australia. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While a body such as the Australian Sports Drug Agency is capable of testing a wide range of athletes, at the end of the day there are finite resources and it is inevitable that there will be those cheats who will not be detected. One can only hope that the level of resources presently available to the Agency is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by congratulating the Agency on the level of its competence, skill, integrity and ability and the reputation which it has internationally for the activities it carries out under the references given to it by the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I observe that this is another report that has taken a long time to come into the Senate. In fact, the report was signed by Mr Harris, the Chairman, on 6 December 1991, so obviously it could not have had time to be printed and placed here before we rose on 21 December 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall make a couple of points and then seek leave to continue my remarks. This is an important report which should be considered at some length by the Senate. In particular, I draw attention to the fact that the Australian Sports Foundation, which was established to generate private sector donations and support for sport through the Australian Sports Commission, is in a sense not doing as well as one would hope in view of the taxation benefits available. I hope that in the future, particularly under a coalition government, far greater attention will be paid to this important element of sports funding. In the latest annual report we see that income derived by the Foundation comprised only $4.5m compared with $8.8m the previous year. I understand that to an extent that diminution was because of the special boost the Sports Foundation got as a result of the unsuccessful bid by Melbourne to win the Olympic Games. A lot of money was raised specifically for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from all that, we see that funds raised through the Foundation to assist national sporting organisations still fell by something like $900,000 last financial year, from the 1989-90 level of $3.12m to $2.25m. As I said, I hope that greater effort and concentration can be made in the future and more energy utilised in encouraging, through the tax system, further and better assistance to sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the GST package&mdash;the Fightback package&mdash;will provide significant benefits to many sporting organisations. As the Senate knows, at the moment there is a 20 per cent sales tax on all sporting equipment. Not only will sporting clubs receive the benefit of that tax being wiped out under the Fightback package; all sports organisations will be able to get a full refund of the GST of 15 per cent payable on sporting equipment because they will be in the `business' of providing sporting facilities. Therefore, all payments for such sporting equipment will be fully deductible. That is an important matter. That applies to the GST or any other taxes on equipment used, for example, for mowing wickets, for preparing pitches and so on. This would be a significant reduction in the costs of the sporting organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think a lot of sports bodies have wrongly assumed that they will somehow be disadvantaged by the Fightback package. Looking at the broad impact of the package, particularly the reduction of fuel costs and so on, there is no doubt that sporting clubs will be significantly advantaged by the introduction of the Fightback package. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>The efficiency audit was carried out by the National Audit Office in relation to the Department of Defence and its management of Australian purchases under the United States foreign military sales program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The efficiency audit is very important. It is a very disturbing report. This program is very large indeed. It relates to purchases by the Australian Government of military supplies from the United States Government, through the United States foreign military sales program, which was set up 20-odd years ago to assist allies of the United States such as Australia in obtaining equipment made in the United States under programs where the United States is procuring this equipment. Allies such as ourselves have been able to acquire this equipment as part of production runs for the purchase of the same equipment by the United States. There is a great benefit for Australia in that program and, no doubt, a benefit for the American manufacturers, who obtain larger orders and their production runs are therefore greater and more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program that is being investigated by the Auditor-General's Office reveals that, as at 31 December 1990, the programs still being considered had a value of over $6 billion. There were outstanding payments under the program of over $1 billion. This is a very large program which has been administered within the Department of Defence. Yet the report shows that there is no central authority established within the Department of Defence to provide guidance, general control and related matters associated with such a large purchasing program as the one in question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report notes a lack of adequate policies for a proper information system to be available for the purpose of financial management. It also notes that there are large payments on account with respect to many of these purchases and that the final payments are resolved by the assessment of the equipment received by Australia. Adjustments have to be made. The report notes that there have been significant refunds of surplus advance payments and difficulties in determining the value of supplies received and so on. So there is revealed major financial mismanagement on the part of the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just by way of example, I refer to one section of the report which reveals that the Audit Office carried out I suppose a random survey of 66 cases. The Audit Office sought detailed information from case managers in respect of this sample of 66 current cases. In 13 of these cases, the values of supplies received by Australia were less than the values of supplies shown in the United States quarterly billing statements as having been delivered. They are really quite extraordinary discrepancies. But in nine cases it was found that the Department of Defence had no record of the values of supplies received by Australia at all. So obviously there is a large degree of inadequate record-keeping in relation to these, albeit, very large programs. The record-keeping by the Department and the financial management generally of this program were found to be severely wanting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This, unfortunately, is not by any means the first time that there have been problems with procurement by the Department of Defence and failings in management by the Department with respect to a number of these programs. We are familiar, of course, with the very severe cost blow-outs in Department of Defence procurement programs. It must be a very severe worry that at the moment the Department has procurement programs of something like $27 billion&mdash;that is, procurement not just relating to foreign military sales but to other sources. Fortunately these days procurement is also carried out in Australia. But where there are such large procurement programs being undertaken by the Department of Defence, it is very alarming indeed to get reports like this which throw very great doubt upon the quality of the financial management in the Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only a week or so ago we read that the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) made a statement in which he admitted that the Department was having to look at options to make further savings in the combat side of defence. Presumably, there is to be some shortfall in the Navy's budget for the current year. The Navy's activities are going to have to be tightened&mdash;possibly by the mothballing of some of its warships, including a new frigate. Whether that is going to occur or not is, according to the Minister, not decided. But the fact that it is having to be considered shows how tight the defence budget is and the way in which mismanagement of procurement programs of this size can have such a very severe effect on the combat capability of our Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has been pointing out the need for much greater savings and efficiency in the management of the Department of Defence, not just at Russell Hill in Canberra but generally. Here, again, we have another example of where very great losses could be sustained as a result of mismanagement of procurement programs. I know there is no finding that there have actually been losses in this case, but the concern is that that could easily happen when we have such lax procedures and such inadequate management structures. One must be left with very great concern about the procurement program generally. As I have said, we must be particularly concerned when we are looking at the present programs, which amount to something like $27 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, I had occasion to draw attention to these problems. I learnt that, in fact, the Industry Commission had suggested to the Government that it should be given a reference to consider the whole of the procurement policy and the management of procurement by the Defence Force. To my surprise, the Government rejected that proposal from the Industry Commission&mdash;a very highly skilled external review body which now possesses a very high reputation for providing an examination of government activities of one sort or another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me&mdash;and I say this again&mdash;that this whole procurement program of the Department of Defence is crying out for a review by such a body as the Industry Commission. The report that we have now received and which has been tabled in the Senate is a very good example of why an external review of that kind of that whole program is so urgently required.

I am also delighted to see him because I am about to make reference to the complete shambles that he created in tabling these regulations and in seeking their proclamation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go very briefly through what occurred. The first proclamation was on 1 January 1992. On that day, part II of the Political</PARA>
<PARA>Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act was to commence. It was signed by the Governor-General on 19 December 1991. The proclamation is probably void, as the Minister will acknowledge&mdash;it just had no effect&mdash;because it was not published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth of Australia Gazette</EMPHASIS> until 2 January. That was contrary to section 17J of the Acts Interpretation Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought it pretty elementary that the Minister and his Department would realise that unless the proclamation and the gazetting occurred on the same day the whole thing lacked any legality. They did realise this and attempted to fix it. We therefore had a second proclamation on 3 January as the date of commencement for part II of the Act. It was signed and published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> on that day. That was the first mix-up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second mix-up occurred when two sets of regulations under the Act relating to Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory were made on 19 December 1991 and gazetted on that day. They were tabled in the Senate on the same day and were subject to a motion of disallowance by us, which was moved by leave. There was debate and the matter was finally adjourned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further set of regulations relating to New South Wales were made on 23 December and published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> on 3 January. These regulations were never tabled. Why was there a mess up? Why were they not tabled?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first two sets of regulations were expressed to commence on 1 January 1992. The regulations could not commence on that date because of the problem with the first proclamation. As the Minister well knows, other errors occurred in the set of regulations relating to New South Wales. All these problems having been realised, all three sets of regulations were repealed. So the Minister made a dreadful mess of all three sets of regulations. When this was brought to his attention, they were all repealed and substitute regulations were made on 3 January 1992 and published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> of the same day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These regulations were all illegal. The first two sets were illegal because they were contrary to section 48B of the Acts Interpretation Act, which prohibits the remaking of regulations that are the subject of an unresolved disallowance motion, and the third set was illegal because it violated section 48A of the Acts Interpretation Act, which prohibits the making of regulations before they have been tabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When these problems were realised, further sets of regulations were made and published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> on 10 January. Those people really listening to this debate must begin to wonder what on earth the Government, the Department and the Minister could have been on about over those months from December to January. In the meantime, we had elections coming up in New South Wales where there was a by-election, in Tasmania where there was a State election, and in the ACT where there was a Territory election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implication of all this mucking about must be seen by the Minister as at least embarrassing to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, which at this stage was trying valiantly to make some decisions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht made claims today that we were all very happy about it in Tasmania. He quoted Bob Lister, our General Director back home, and Michael Hodgman as saying how happy they were about it. Mr Lister was only answering questions in relation to our Party. Very rightly, he said that we were happy with the results. He was not asked to answer on behalf of the Independents of that State. I pointed out earlier&mdash;and the Minister was not here then so he might be interested&mdash;that the people who had free air time were Labor, Liberal, the Greens and one Independent out of the 10 Independents who had to put their names in a hat to see who would get that additional free time. An Advance Tasmania group which, just because it had not been given the required amount of time to register as a party, remained a group. But it had two candidates in every electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The names of its members were not drawn out of the hat; only one Independent, a Mr Jamieson from the west coast, was drawn out of the hat. He got 10 minutes free time. Every other Independent, including those in the Advance Tasmania group, were denied free time. That is democracy Labor style and that is democracy Australian Democrat style. They joined to put this legislation through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not democracy Liberal style, although it suited us and we did so well in our State that Labor got only 29 per cent of the vote. We did very well and we were perfectly happy with our result. But many of us, including me, are furious on behalf of those Independents who did not stand a chance. Because of Labor's type of democracy they were denied any free time, any advertising, on radio or television and they did not stand a chance of putting their policy and their views to the Tasmanian public. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The redebate of this issue using this means is, I think, a disgraceful abuse of the Senate and sits uneasily on the shoulders of people who sing the praises of the Senate system and its proper use. The Opposition is having a second go. Having lost the argument during the debate on the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill, it is now attempting to disallow the regulations. The irony is that the regulations it is trying to disallow relate specifically to elections in Tasmania and the ACT, both of which have been held. So what the Opposition is doing, in fact, is attempting to disallow regulations which no longer have application. I think that makes the process a nonsense and a disgraceful waste of the Senate's time. But it does give the Opposition an opportunity, I guess, to rabbit on with the same posed, self-righteous fervour which it applied during the debate on the Bill and which makes no more sense now than it did then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of this the Opposition has consistently failed to concede the central problem from which the ad ban and the accompanying disclosure provisions arise. The Bill arose out of the widespread concerns, not only in Australia but also in many comparable countries around the world, about the possibility of the corruption of the political process as a result of the twin problems of, on the one hand, the rapidly rising costs of political advertising, in particular television advertising, and, on the other, the resultant pressure placed on political parties in a highly competitive environment, in which the stakes are inevitably high, to raise the increasingly large budgets to fund such campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has consistently chosen to ignore expressions of concern, for example, by the various inquiries set up to examine this very issue. I have referred in previous debates to comments from the Fitzgerald inquiry, from the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales, from the Carter Royal Commission in Tasmania, and from the WA Inc Royal Commission looking into these matters in Western Australia. All three of the completed inquiries&mdash;that is, all of those inquiries except the Western Australian one&mdash;have expressed specific and strongly worded concerns about the need for regulation of political fundraising in the light of the increasing costs of campaigning. In Western Australia there is now a general inquiry, which is running concurrently with the individual inquiries, which is looking at that very same thing and is bound to come up with some recommendations that I believe will be similar to those of other inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps it is best expressed by Commissioner Roden&mdash;and I will not go into all the quotations which I have given before&mdash;from the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So long as substantial donations can be made to political parties or candidates without disclosure, they can be used to purchase influence. The law that allows secret political donations, creates conditions conducive to corrupt conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As increasingly large sums of money become necessary for successful political campaigns the problem will grow. It must be faced and dealt with firmly and openly. To allow large secret donations to political parties or candidates is but one step removed from allowing secret deals with political parties or candidates.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The alternative to compulsory public disclosure, I believe, is an unacceptable risk that through financial necessity influence with government (of any political colour) will be a purchasable commodity.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that aptly sums up the link between the question of the increasing cost of running campaigns and the pressure that is put on political parties in trying to meet those costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has also consistently refused to acknowledge overseas experience, which demonstrates the direction in which the Australian political process could go if we do not face the problem boldly and creatively. I have already referred to the Recruit scandal in Japan, which has rocked, and continues to rock, the very foundations of that society at the highest levels, and the Watergate scandal in the USA, in which systematic corruption of the political process was uncovered at the very highest levels of that society too. We cannot simply assume that that sort of thing will not happen here. There are early indications that it might have happened here, particularly in the honourable senator's State. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NE4">Senator BEAHAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak particularly about Senator Macdonald's State, where the real evidence is. Yet the Opposition fails to pay any attention to the vigorous debate that is currently under way in the United States to address problems uncovered by Watergate, problems which have been inadequately addressed by previous attempts at regulation but which are now again the subject of lively debate because of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is rather like the movement towards a republic in Australia; the Opposition just cannot cope with change. There is an inexorable movement towards a republic in this country, just as there is an inexorable movement towards a cleaner political system in this country. Yet the Opposition always finds itself in the position of having to oppose. Canute-like, it is pushing back the inexorable waves of time, but it fails, inevitably, because change does occur despite the Opposition's conservative posture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has introduced, with the support of the Democrats, a two-pronged approach to a problem which is widely acknowledged but studiously ignored by the Opposition. On the one hand it has introduced full disclosure of all political donations, disclosure of a kind which cannot be avoided, as political parties of all persuasions have done, and, secondly, it has introduced a ban on paid political advertising for the period from the issuing of the writs to election day and replaced this with the mandatory provision by TV networks of a limited number of two-minute information slots run concurrently on all stations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of this it is interesting that the Opposition has failed to give anything but hedged and contingent support to the concept of disclosure. It has twisted and turned and unearthed every furphy possible to try to avoid disclosing who gives it money. Despite the fact that previous speakers have said that they would have been in favour of disclosure, they showed no signs of this during the debate. They hedged and attached contingencies to it. They showed paranoia about one set of donors, completely ignoring another set of donors. When there was some attempt to get an amendment that might suit both parties, the Opposition would not be part of that in any case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the question of disclosure is widely seen as the crux of any attempts to guarantee the integrity of the political system. I would like to quote briefly from a submission that I have made to the Royal Commission in Western Australia in its general inquiry into this whole area. In the conclusion to a submission that I have made, I say the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question of fund raising for political parties is a vexed one and one which goes to the heart of any assessment of the integrity of the political system. The public, understandably, cannot have confidence in a system in which they believe that money buys influence and that elected representatives lack independence because of their need to pander to wealthy donors.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>We have consistently supported full disclosure; we have consistently supported the sorts of changes to the electoral system which make it fairer and which the Opposition has opposed consistently over the years. I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most politicians and party officials from all political persuasions, involved in party fund raising, approach the task, in my experience, honestly and with due propriety. Most apply clear caveats to donations, indicating to the donors that they can expect no favours in return for their support. Yet despite their honest intentions they are, I believe, unwittingly compromised by the very process of which they are a part.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Forced to raise funds from the corporate sector, which is now by far the largest source of funds for the major parties, they are tacitly a part of a system in which at least some of the participants believe that they are trading in patronage and influence. Tony Eggleton, the well respected former National Director of the Liberal Party admitted in an interview with Michelle Grattan of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Melbourne Age</EMPHASIS> that when Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister, he was told when Liberal Party donors wanted to see him, and that this would&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I quote him&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"get them in the door marginally more quickly."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such commitments in return for donations are at the not altogether benign end of a continuum of influence peddling. Of similar benignity is the not uncommon status seeking which motivates some donors. At the other, less benign end of the continuum are those who believe that they are, through their donations, directly purchasing patronage, favour or privilege.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do not talk nonsense. I continued as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are, I believe, few major donors who do not expect to gain some personal advantage as a result of their donations or who, conversely, hope to avoid by their willingness to donate, some perceived disadvantage at the hands of government, the parliament or the party in question.</PARA>
<PARA>I concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is growing concern that the political process in Australia is following patterns set in the USA or Japan&mdash;systems characterized by some observers as endemically corrupt. Something must be done to halt this trend and to defend the historical integrity of our political system.</PARA>
<PARA>I went on to recommend to that Commission that it express support for the full disclosure of all political donations, whatever their source or purpose; a systematic public funding for political parties; and realistic initiatives to limit the impact of the rapidly increasing costs of political campaigning&mdash;all of which have been attempted by this Government and most of which, in fact, have now been implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting that the Opposition has consistently ignored the fact that there is nothing unusual about banning political advertising. In fact, it can be argued that Australia, with its previous lack of regulation, was the odd country out. Such regulation is the norm in comparable countries overseas&mdash;many countries which Opposition members would be very happy to associate themselves with. Of the 19 countries studied by the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters, first of all, and then by the Senate Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures in more detail, only four permit paid political advertising and one of these, Canada, limits it to the campaign period. So countries like England, France, Sweden, Austria, Italy, Norway and Denmark&mdash;none of which one would call countries that are undemocratic or countries that have applied draconian laws&mdash;all apply bans of various sorts to advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the advertising ban, where it has been applied, has been successful. I think all the indications of the limited experience that we have had now in Tasmania and the ACT and the by-election in The Entrance in New South Wales have lent support to that argument. It has reduced expenditure; it has reduced it by as much as a claimed 50 per cent in Tasmania. It has reduced expenditure in all of the elections that I have just referred to. It has not diminished, as many claimed it would, the awareness of elections, as has already been pointed out in some detail by Senator Faulkner. The voting turnout went up in Tasmania and the ACT and was at a remarkably high level in The Entrance for a by-election held at the very difficult time that it was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no evidence either that the money that would have been spent on television was spent in other areas, which the Opposition has consistently claimed, otherwise there simply would not have been the 50 per cent reduced expenditure already claimed. I think the Opposition would find that that would be the same for its own political party. It is interesting in that regard that I did not notice the Opposition refusing to take the advantages of free air time, or offering the networks that it is so very worried about the money to make up for the free time that it was getting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the anecdotal evidence, there seems to have been a great deal of success and the public seems to have accepted the whole thing remarkably well. Most people, it seems, are much happier with the idea of a two-minute head and shoulder substantial advertisement than statements made in 60 or 30 seconds which tend to be glitzy, superficial and often misleading, and seldom much to do with the substance of an election. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not share their concern for the networks which took us to the cleaners consistently&mdash;both of the major parties anyway. Any party which spent large on television advertising was taken to the cleaners by networks consistently at a time when they knew they had us over a barrel. We had to run an election campaign, and they had the right to charge us almost what they wanted&mdash;and they did. I have no concerns about the networks as far as that is concerned. </PARA>

I cannot pronounce the member's name. When one talks about corruption, it makes Burkegate look like a Sunday school picnic.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The major point I am trying to make is that in the final analysis what really concerned me was that the net effect of the regulations and the ban was to place, in my opinion anyway, a huge amount of power in the hands of the print media. If an example is wanted of that, on the day before the election when there was still a big undecided vote out there, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> put out on its front page results that a news poll had produced saying that the Liberals were going to bolt in, which in the event they did. But there was some thought around that that may have engendered people to get on the winning band wagon. People like backing winners and that may have influenced that undecided vote. Conversely, of course, it may have gone the other way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, an editorial appeared in the paper that day&mdash;rightly or wrongly&mdash;that was very biased towards the Labor Party. We had the two chief political writers virtually imploring the public to vote for the Labor Party. In fact, that did not happen, but the point I am trying to make is that these people in the media bent over backwards to try to influence the voters one way or the other. I do not believe that would have happened if the candidates had been able to put forward their points of view on radio or television. I have to correct a couple of things that I put forward this morning. Senator Faulkner&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Somebody commented&mdash;I think it was Senator Faulkner again&mdash;that Michael Hodgman, the current Speaker of the House of Assembly in Tasmania, made the point that it did not disadvantage things too much. I can tell Senator Faulkner that I was in the company of Michael Hodgman on at least two occasions at public functions when he made the point very strongly that, regardless of the results, it was an erosion of human rights that people were not able to put forward their points of view on radio and television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can also tell Senator Faulkner that the reason there was a huge turnout of voters in Tasmania was not because there was an ad ban, it was because the voting public of Tasmania had been waiting for 2 1/2 years to put a majority government, of whatever flavour, back in power. They had enough of the Green-Labor experience. Let us face it, there was only one real issue in that election: stability of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we have a political situation in a State or even in the nation where issues and policies have to be debated, I wonder just how the people are going to find out the points of view and how candidates are going to correct incorrect statements that have been made either in the Parliament or in unpaid ads? We had evidence only yesterday in the House of Representatives of the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, making some false statements about the Fightback package. If that happens during an election campaign, when candidates cannot pay for ads and put their points of view, how are these things going to be corrected? How is the opportunity going to be given to political parties or independents to correct those statements? <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister should look at some of the effects of the exercise in Tasmania.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be intrigued to hear the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) indicate to us just which set of regulations he thinks applied to the three elections that have been mentioned this evening: the Tasmanian and ACT elections and the New South Wales by-election. There are three sets of regulations, and no-one seemed to be able to indicate to me just which regulations the Minister or the ABT think they are working on. I would like the Minister to tell me which of the regulations they are using.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government introduced the first set of regulations but could not get the numbers right. This Minister is so incompetent that he could not even get the headings in the sections of the Act correct. That was the first mistake this Minister made. Then he and his officers messed up the day on which it should have been proclaimed. They published this first set of regulations but realised, or thought they realised, that they had proclaimed the regulations before the Act had been proclaimed. So in a series of brilliant manoeuvres, they decided to introduce regulations set No. 2. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regulations set No. 2 was done supposedly on the right day, 3 January, but the Minister and his officers did not realise that there was a provision in the Acts Interpretations Act saying that, if there were unresolved notices of disallowance in relation to the first set&mdash;which there were&mdash;the second set could not be used. So they said, `Well, obviously we cannot use this second set'. They then went to the third set, which they got around to on 10 January, and they thought, `Seeing that the second set is not right, we will  just amend the first set. That way we do not have to worry about that rule that you cannot deal with them while there is an unresolved disallowance motion on. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>We will bring in some amendments&mdash;not new regulations.' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>They thought they were going to amend the first set of regulations by this third set of regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is all very well, except that they did not look carefully enough at the second set of regulations. If the Minister looks at the second set of regulations he will realise that most of the provisions contain matters that are substantially the same as in the first set, therefore they could not be dealt with. But the Minister did not realise that he had a final paragraph in the second set of regulations which said that the statutory rules introduced previously were repealed. That was not the same as the previous regulations that did not apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Minister is left with in the Tasmanian case, if I might use that as an example, is 14 regulations in the second set, which were substantially the same as the first set and therefore could not apply. But <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>the regulation is not substantially the same as the first set and so it does apply. Does the Minister know what it says? It says that the regulations he introduced on 3 January&mdash;one to 14&mdash;are repealed. Does the Minister realise where that has left him? He cannot use the second set of regulations. The third set of regulations, which he thought were good, are only amendments to the first set, which he has repealed by the second set. That leaves the Minister with no regulations at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell the Minister what it will do to him and to the Government. They tell me the Minister used to be a lawyer. Does he think someone might sue for damages?  Does he think that might be a possibility? Some of these people who have been wronged, to their monetary detriment, by abiding by these regulations, which he said were right and which the ABT has acted upon, are going to be out of pocket. Does he think they are just going to walk away and say, `That is bad luck.'? Of course they are not. They are going to sue the Government or the ABT of someone for a lot of money. I know that the Government's Budget deficit is hopeless at the moment&mdash;$9 billion overdrawn. How is it going to be when these people get to it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has no regulations at all. He is going to be looking down the barrel of a very substantial damages case, and rightly so. I just hope it comes against him personally because it may make him more careful in the future. There is no need for the Minister to leave the chamber.

He was not prepared to allow people to go through them and work out what they were about. He insisted that they be rammed through before there was any proper or considered opinion and debate on it. He has an absolute and unholy shambles. He will wear it, and he deserves to wear it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Senator Bolkus&mdash;if he is in earshot, having scurried out&mdash;what I wanted to put to him to his face, and that is the disgraceful, despicable and cowardly attack he made upon officers of this chamber in his speech. It is typical of the Labor Party and the people on the front bench to attack people who cannot respond and who do not have the right to respond. That is what Senator Bolkus embarked upon today&mdash;a despicable and cowardly attack. He accused officers of this Senate of giving us advice. As I understand it, that is what they are here to do&mdash;to give all senators impartial advice&mdash;and that is what they do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not notice Senator Bolkus being too concerned about the quality of the advice during that debate when he and his advisers were continuously seeking the advice of the Clerk. It was good enough then, when the Clerk was advising the Minister on how to try to get this stupid and irresponsible Bill through this chamber&mdash;they were then well prepared to seek the advice of the Clerk&mdash;but when the Clerk gives us advice that is apparently not convenient to the Government's course of action, suddenly that is wrong, and Senator Bolkus embarks upon this despicable and cowardly attack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the Clerk happens to give independent, impartial advice which is not convenient to the Government, therefore, it is wrong. But when the Clerk gives advice to the Minister to help him get his shambles through this chamber, it is okay. The hypocrisy is almost as unbearable as the despicable and cowardly attack. Those opposite should have a little more respect for the institutions of Parliament and not just criticise people because they happen to give advice that does not suit the political agenda of this Government. That is quite despicable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could not follow some of the arguments propagated by Senator Bolkus and Senator Schacht in particular. I stopped listening after them. If the rest of the speakers were going to give out the drivel that Senator Bolkus and Senator Schacht did, then they would not have been worthwhile listening to. Senator Bolkus tried to use the line that, because advertising costs a lot of money, it engenders corruption and, therefore, has to be banned. But he did not refer to the ACT Labor Party advertising on the electronic media through Sky Channel on videos around the clubs, and he did not talk about it using the movie houses to advertise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I challenge Senator Bolkus to answer this: did he give advice to the ACT Labor Party on what it could do? I challenge Senator Bolkus to tell this Senate just what he told the ACT Labor Party it could do&mdash;whether it sought his guidance and advice on whether it could advertise on Sky Channel, on videos around the clubs and on movie screens. Those things seem to be electronic to me and it also seems to me that, unless they are owned by Laurie Connell or Alan Bond, it would have cost the Labor Party money to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the sense of the argument the Government has been running that it is banning political advertisements on television to save money so there will not be corruption, but such advertisements can be run at the movie houses at an expensive price? The ridiculousness continued when either Senator Schacht or Senator Bolkus referred to a campaign that Mr Kroger was running in Victoria. I know nothing about that, but I do know about the campaign that Mr Goss is running in Queensland. If the whole premise of the Government's argument about banning free speech is that advertising costs too much&mdash;you need a lot of money&mdash;and that causes corruption, can the Government tell me what the difference is between that and Mr Goss in Queensland at the moment running advertisements costing hundreds, probably millions of dollars? How is that saving expenditure? How is that stopping corruption? I would like someone to tell me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hundreds of thousands, even millions, of dollars are being spent on television advertising by Mr Goss in Queensland at the moment, and the Government says that, because he is spending all that money, that leads him to corruption. I would probably agree with the Government. Where is he getting all this money from? How will he pay for all these expensive television advertisements in Queensland? How will he do it? The Government's theory is that, because he is paying for the expensive television advertisements at the moment, he must be getting the money for them corruptly and, therefore, they should be banned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is how the Government started out. That is how it wanted it initially&mdash;it wanted to cut out those advertisements. But someone got at the Government&mdash;probably Mr Goss. He probably told the Government he wanted to advertise between now and then and made the Government change its mind. So the Government's whole argument was completely ridiculous. I notice the gentlemen opposite are silent&mdash;there are no ladies. This seems to be an argument that embarrasses them somewhat and they cannot answer it. Senator Bolkus may be able to explain that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the Australian Democrats and the way that they have been involved in this issue. For the 30 pieces of silver in the old days, which converts, as Senator Kemp mentioned, to $1.8m, the Democrats were allowed to be bought off on this Act. Last time the Democrats spent $380,000 and this time they will get $1.8m of so-called free&mdash;free to them at least&mdash;advertising campaign money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was at least pleased to see my Queensland colleague Senator Kernot today agree with Senator Kemp that his figures were right. The Democrats used to spend about $400,000, they will now get almost $2m worth of `free' advertising at the next election. I admire Senator Kernot's honesty in admitting to that. She should, however, talk to her Leader, Senator Coulter. During the debate on 3 December he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Looking at the formula of time allocated and the formula used to divide up time, we calculate that it is remarkably similar to and probably slightly less than we have had on previous occasions.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Coulter, the Leader of that bunch of Democrats, is saying that they used to do almost the same amount of advertising as they are getting now. As Senator Kernot acknowledged, that is a complete and utter mistruth and Senator Coulter should come into this chamber and either explain it, or at least apologise to this Senate for such an outrageous assertion. It could only be people of the likes of Senator Coulter who could believe that their previous spending of about $400,000 in some way equated in time to $1.8m. It is absolutely ridiculous. I hope that Senator Coulter will come into this debate and explain how he calculates that and apologise to us for misleading us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the failures of this legislation is that the Democrats will get advertising paid for by the television stations&mdash;expropriated from the television stations&mdash;of about $1.8m, which equates to the 12, 13 or 14 per cent that they might have got at the last election. This is absolutely amazing and unreal in view of the fact their vote is now running at about 5 per cent and it is falling rapidly, particularly when Senator Powell was Leader. She was struggling, the polls were falling, but then the Democrats, in a flash of wisdom, got rid of Senator Powell and installed that statesman like new Leader, Senator Coulter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The polls have shown what people think of that&mdash;they have continued to go down. By the time the next election comes around&mdash;and that will be a long time away because this lot opposite do not have the courage to call an election before the latest possible time&mdash;the Democrats' vote will be down to nothing. Yet they will still be funded on the basis of the vote they got at the last election at the height of the environmental vote in this State. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have a holier than thou attitude about the democratic institutions and about how our society has to be entirely democratic with people having the freedom to do what they like. Would you believe, Madam Acting Deputy President, that it is the Democrat crew who are going to stop the Greens right around Australia from advertising on television at the next election?

I suggest to you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would say that the Democrats knew full well that new parties and independents around Australia, such as the Greens, would be competing very strenuously at the next election for the vote that the Australian Democrats have received in the past.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that all of the votes that the Democrats picked up last time were `Richardson' votes that went to him via the Democrats&mdash;the Democrats picked up something; the balance went to the Labor Party. The Democrats well know that all of that vote will go to the Green independents at the next election, because not even they trust the Australian Democrats&mdash;not even they trust them to do what needs to be done in their view. They do not trust them because they see the Australian Democrats as, in their view, just another political party with all of the machinations, all of the leadership overthrowing and all of the backstabbing. I am not even sure that Mr Keating did not learn some of the art of backstabbing from the way that the Australian Democrats got rid of their former leader. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are under challenge from the Greens. If one were a Democrat, how would one stop that. One would make sure that they could not advertise. One would not want them telling one's constituents how hopeless one was or that one does not look after their interests. One would not want them to get any advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have the Australian Democrats done? They have caved in to this Government. They have sold out for $1.8m and made sure at the same time that their opponents get no chance at all. Maybe they learnt that from Keating. This is the group that, in the interests of democracy, supposedly supported this piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tasmanian experience has shown that independents, in particular, have no chance in federal seats. Independents have to fight sitting federal members who, practically by the grace of this Government, which has a majority in the other place, are given an almost unlimited amount of money to use on direct mailing to people in their large electorates. Any independent, any new candidate, any new party which might want to contest some of these seats will not have the advantage of all of that postage money that has been splashed about by the ALP Government and will not be able to get themselves known through advertising on television or radio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, effectively, this Government has given itself a headstart in any future election. It knows it full well. The Government knows that it cannot advertise because its supporters have realised what a rotten bunch its members are, and would not give them any money. Labor is broke everywhere. It cannot even run its property in Sydney without showing huge losses and trying to impose levies on the unionists to bail it out of its problems. So the Government has given itself a huge benefit at the expense of independents and new parties.

Yet, apparently, it was widely publicised during the Tasmanian election that if one did not happen to be from the Liberal Party, the Labor Party or the Greens, one had to rely on having one's name drawn out of a hat if one wanted to advertise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The political circumstances that now confront us are entirely different from any we have encountered in the postwar period and, in particular, since the introduction of television in Australia in the middle of the 1950s. We can now make an early but reasonable judgment of the impact of the Government's electoral reform legislation in the area of political broadcasting and political disclosures as a consequence of three political contests, each of which had different results&mdash;very clear and unambiguous results but very different results in terms of their outcomes. I refer, of course, to the Tasmanian general election, which was won by the Liberal Party, and to the victories by the ALP in the Entrance by-election and the Australian Capital Territory election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It strikes me that, in terms of the debate here in this early part of the evening, the remarkable element that is common to the three elections in different political, cultural and geographical circumstances is not only the clarity of the results but also the fact that each of the results has been remarkably free of complaint and recrimination. That, of course, is not characteristic of Australian political history over the last couple of decades or so. The impact, very directly, of the Government's electoral reform legislation&mdash;and I stress that; it is legislation which has been designed to reform the system&mdash;has been overwhelmingly positive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The easy way to judge that is simply to reflect for a moment on the simple, elementary fact that each of the political parties competing under the terms of the new legislation and each of the candidates, not necessarily those affiliated with the major parties, competing under the terms of the new legislation found it relatively easy to do so. So far as we can tell, based on the experience to date, the Government's legislation in this area has had absolutely no negative impact whatsoever&mdash;not upon the parties, not upon the candidates, not upon the people charged with administering the system and, most importantly of all, not upon the voters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The electors have greeted this legislation with an ease and a preparedness to work within the new system&mdash;which again is not characteristic of our history. When we have changed electoral laws in the past&mdash;be it voting systems, be it related to distributions and redistributions of seats, be it related to the registration of political parties and so on&mdash;there have been problems. But based on the experience in the Entrance, in Tasmania and in the ACT, virtually no problem has been experienced anywhere. So far as we can tell, there have been no distortions in the system as a consequence of the new legislation. There have been absolutely no unforeseen consequences. That must be unique in our political history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not seen claims of manipulation and deception by anyone. We have not seen claims of people having been misled. We are not in the courts, as we were in New South Wales, for example, as a consequence of the 25 May 1991 general election. No one has been denied rights: rights to participate, rights to have their views registered in a free way&mdash;and I will come to that term `a free way' a little later. Certainly it has not been suggested by anyone that a group of people, a political party or a single candidate has been given an unfair advantage over competitors or opponents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress again that among the Australian electorate, among the public, no-one is complaining at all about the absence of political advertising on television and radio. From what we can see, by way of making an early judgment&mdash;I think a reasonable judgment; a little later we will be able to say an informed judgment&mdash;the Australian electorate seems to have welcomed the impact of the legislation. We have not seen claims and recriminations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mention has been made of circumstances in Tasmania. I had cause a few days ago to describe certain political decisions on the part of my Party as an intolerable folly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Someone ought to tell the Liberal Party that it won the Tasmanian election. At the end of February we are debating regulations which applied to a general election at the beginning of the month. That is the problem opposite. It is not only ideological zealotry that is continually in evidence opposite; we have come to expect that. It is not even anticipated. It is a simple reality. It is the politics of throwback all the time that we see. It is harking back; it is looking back. It is trying to undo things that have been done.

So it is unfortunate that, judging by some of the contributions opposite, the debate leads absolutely nowhere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us stop for a moment to look at political campaigns now as a consequence of what has happened in those three political contests in New South Wales, in Tasmania and in the ACT, because I think it is instructive for all of us who are concerned with the democratic process and all of us who are committed to its effective functioning. For a start, it is easy to observe but nonetheless true that newspapers have come back very much into the centre ground of our politics in terms not only of their political coverage and their editorials but also of the campaign material that is contained within them&mdash;not just flagship advertisements and how-to-votes, but material that is designed to establish a theme. I make that point by way of an opening remark. The remarks I make beyond that I hope will mean far more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is definitely true that face to face campaigning at an electorate level is now far more significant. It is not a circumstance where candidates can reinforce their messages with comforting and conditioning slogans and jingles. I am glad that those conditioning slogans and jingles are gone because I think they contribute very little, if anything at all, to the political process. I say that as a person who, like many others in the chamber, was charged with the conduct of political campaigns during the 1970s and 1980s&mdash;successful campaigns in the main; unsuccessful campaigns on occasion. The common element in much of that electronic advertising was that it simply contributed very little to the political process, to the understanding by the electorate of the significance of issues, to the platforms on which the parties were fighting the contest, and certainly to the manner in which the Australian electorate was informed as to what the political parties intended to do in government. The Minister at the table, Senator Collins, knows that, from the point of view of opposition in the Northern Territory and government in the Federal sphere. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The circumstances were always, from the 1960s right through to the 1980s, very similar to those which prevailed in international affairs&mdash;that unless one spent an absolute avalanche of dollars in the campaign one would be outspent by one's opponents, who would simply have an advantage. In terms of news and public affairs, though, it means that the parties have to be more creative, more thoughtful, more deliberate and more pointed in the manner in which they communicate with the electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another campaign tool that has come very much into its own, and that is the tool of direct mail. I like the tool of direct mail for a number of reasons. In particular, I like it because it actually enables the political parties to have a dialogue with constituents&mdash;with people who are electors making judgments and casting votes. The best political direct mail invites a response, either in the way the Liberal Party traditionally has adopted, that of a questionnaire or survey, or in the manner the Labor Party favours, which is a direct response. Where that is followed up by doorknocking, telephone contact and the like, particularly involving the candidate, I think it is a very good thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The experience in the United States, to which I will turn in a moment, is of an electorate alienated due to the impact of television, principally television advertising. It is so alienated that recently, when the Governor of California was talking about victims of the recession in the United States, he was found to have made up composite unemployed workers because he simply had never had contact with any. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of what the Government has done by way of its reform program, the parties are obliged to have a much better and clearer focus upon the issues&mdash;again, because the jingles are gone. It does not really matter whether it is `Turn on the lights' or `Wran's our man'. Heavens above, what did those jingles ever contribute in an enduring sense to political understanding or the health of our democracy? I would be interested to hear any honourable senator opposite argue the contrary. It is a question now of issues rather than themes, and I would argue very strongly that, as a consequence of the Government's reform program and our electoral reform legislation, the standard of political debate in Australia has been lifted&mdash;in a qualified sense to date; I believe it will become more pronounced as the impact increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened with interest to the Opposition's arguments. I think it is always of value to listen to what other people are saying in a debate. No-one has a monopoly on wisdom. I must say that I was disappointed. In terms of the notion of freedom to communicate being argued opposite on a continuing basis, I think there is a very necessary response. Where lies the freedom in being obliged to raise millions upon millions of dollars to make a point of communication? Where is the access? It is not open; it is not free; it is not unfettered. As a matter of fact, access to television and radio is open only to those possessed of enormous resources, as everyone in the chamber knows clearly and well. Where is the free capacity for people to argue a political point of view on the national television networks or the FM radio networks without an inexhaustible supply of campaign funds? It simply does not exist. That is the great furphy of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also very disappointing to see politics reduced to a concept of television advertising, as if nothing else is of any consequence at all. Political advertising on television has always been in very large measure, with only a handful of exceptions that come to my mind, characterised as follows: glib, superficial, inconsequential and evanescent. Again, I simply challenge people to produce a single political television commercial that mattered in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People argue that the legislation relates to the Government's standing in the polls. That is simply untrue. As I mentioned earlier, many in the Labor Party argued year in and year out for these reforms to be introduced. The former Prime Minister gave me a personal commitment in the late 1980s that it would be an early item on the agenda after we won in 1990. He kept his word. There is no question that this reform legislation needs to be seen as consistent with other determinations of Labor governments at State and national levels, particularly in respect of the extension of the parliamentary term. That is a very important step to take, and I hope the Government and the Opposition can see their way clear to moving to a referendum in the not too distant future which would extend the life of the House of Representatives from three to four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch briefly upon the manner in which the Opposition has made reference to the Clerk's advice. It is not something I would ordinarily have raised. However, I do not think it can be ignored in the sense that I think the Clerk's office was put in an absolutely invidious circumstance by the manner in which the advice was used and, in my view, misused. I think Senator Bolkus made that clear in his opening remarks. Deleting the important qualifying word `if' in order to make an extraordinary political point was, at the very least, questionable, and if anyone ought to be apologising it is those opposite who were responsible for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also heard from time to time some special pleading on behalf of the television networks from one or two honourable senators opposite. I say again, without fear of contradiction, that the television networks in Australia gouged the political parties for decades for campaign dollars. We are not talking about thousands of dollars; we are talking about millions of dollars. I go right back to 1984 and to the general election of 1 December 1984. There was a television network running a first-run Australian series. From memory, it was <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Last Bastion</EMPHASIS>, but I cannot be certain of that. The circumstances were that the television network that was putting that series to air sought and received nearly $13,000 from the political parties for every 60-second commercial. That was unconscionable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer again to Senator Crichton-Browne's earlier interjection as to why the political parties paid that money.

The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>, talking about political campaigning in the 1990s, stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Putting politicians, ad men and journalists together on the campaign trail produces the worst of all three worlds:  public relations stunts, half-true commercials and acres of trivia.

<PARA>Of course, those observations related to political advertising on television in the United States in 1988 and subsequent to that. There is no doubt that American politics is absolutely dominated by television. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Washington Post</EMPHASIS> in December of last year&mdash;a front page article, as a matter of fact&mdash;observed of the current United States Congress that it had grown very good in two areas of achievement only: the creation of symbols and the making of 60-second television commercials. One can see the impact upon the legislature of the political campaign process being dominated by television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say that I do not think television has an absolutely vital role to play. It can be very constructive and valuable. Particularly in Australia, some of the better public affairs programs achieve that result. Programs such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dateline</EMPHASIS>, just to name three that come to mind, are very valuable in terms of the democratic process. As to 60-second television commercials, I think that they are of no value whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in the United States not only do we talk in terms of costly political TV advertising. Overwhelmingly that advertising is negative because, combining the dominance of television with the effective tyranny of voluntary voting&mdash;and I use that term deliberately&mdash;means that candidates, and by that overwhelmingly I mean incumbent candidates, focus simply upon cobbling together a coalition of voters in a dwindling overall voting constituency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People must be motivated to vote. Motivating people to vote in primaries and in general elections in the United States now overwhelmingly involves making observations that are detrimental to one's opponent and some of it borders on the vicious.

That is true of mayoral contests, gubernatorial contests and contests for the State legislatures, the United States Congress and for the occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

It is designed to communicate with people in their homes, to motivate them to vote in a voluntary voting system. There is little contact between candidates and constituents.

<PARA>Mr President, tonight we announce a series of historic undertakings to help overcome those distances, to improve our links Australia-wide and our interaction with the world. </PARA>
<PARA>To make us more truly one place. </PARA>
<PARA>One very much more efficient nation. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Building a Rail Highway and Competitive Ports</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>We will do what should have been done a hundred  years ago&mdash;we will create a standard gauge national rail highway from Brisbane to Perth via Melbourne and Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA>We shall do it in a way that ensures the project is underpinned by work practices which make such an investment viable. </PARA>
<PARA>The Brisbane-Sydney-Melbourne rail line will be modernised and upgraded for faster and more reliable transit, and a new standard gauge will be laid between Melbourne and Adelaide, tying the east coast network via Melbourne to Perth. </PARA>
<PARA>A standard gauge spur will be built at the port of Brisbane, linking it to the Acacia Ridge rail terminus. A dedicated freight line will be built out of Enfield in Sydney to give trains clear access to the southern line. </PARA>
<PARA>A new rail-sea-road terminus connecting with the port will be constructed at Dynon in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA>Rail facilities at the ports of Fremantle and Adelaide will be upgraded. </PARA>
<PARA>Together with the other mainline rail investments, this will expand opportunities for moving freight across Australia and generally improve the efficiency of our freight transport. </PARA>
<PARA>Exporters will at last see the ports of Sydney and Melbourne competing for business with the ports of Brisbane, Adelaide and Fremantle. </PARA>
<PARA>The rail highway will also provide essential competition with road transport. </PARA>
<PARA>At the same time it will significantly reduce damage to roads, and make them very much safer. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">A Better and Safer Road Network</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, we will be spending over $600 million extra on roads between now and the end of 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA>We will accelerate construction of city ring roads in Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney to link national highways, and we will improve other roads to create a more effective network throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>We are offering to develop the Sturt and Newell highways to create first class direct links between Adelaide and Brisbane and Melbourne and Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Aviation Revolutionised</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, for too long Australians were priced out of air travel by the two-airline agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>Two years ago the Labor Government opened our skies to competition and, especially after Compass entered the market, air travel became affordable to most Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>The enthusiasm was enormous. It boosted business and tourism. </PARA>
<PARA>But we have taken only the first step. </PARA>
<PARA>With tonight's Statement a new Australasian air transport policy is unveiled. </PARA>
<PARA>It brings cheaper and more efficient air services within Australia and abroad.</PARA>
<PARA>It binds Australia and New Zealand in a truly competitive environment. </PARA>
<PARA>It means Qantas will at last carry domestic passengers, and our established domestic airlines will fly international routes. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government expects that Australian and Ansett Airlines will be operating across the Tasman by 1993 at the latest. </PARA>
<PARA>To help new competitors into the airline industry we will build new common-user air terminals where they are needed. </PARA>
<PARA>We will also speed the expansion of the international terminal in Melbourne, and the development of Brisbane's international airport. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, our great changes to the national transport system will make our continent smaller and our nation greater. They are a one billion dollar investment in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, we will start other projects to make better use of our resources and integrate our States and cities. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Generating Power</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>We have a great capacity to produce electricity&mdash;but it is not as cheap as it should be. </PARA>
<PARA>We will seek the co-operation of the State Premiers to develop a National Grid Corporation to connect users and producers from Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA>To facilitate this my Government is offering $100 million to upgrade the transmission link between New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>With the States' agreement, we will take the crucial step of separating power generation from distribution. </PARA>
<PARA>By thus obliging the power generating authorities to compete, we will improve service and efficiency, and deliver energy to homes and industry more cheaply than most other countries in the world. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Other Public Works</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, among other major public works to be undertaken, in Victoria a high quality rail service will be built from Melbourne to Geelong. </PARA>
<PARA>In Queensland a rail service will be built to connect Brisbane to Robina on the Gold Coast, providing transport to one of the fastest-growing communities in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>In Adelaide we will get the Multifunction Polis going by paying for and carrying out the early stages of site work. </PARA>
<PARA>And in Perth a sewage treatment plant will be built, using Australian-developed, world-best processes&mdash;for the benefit of the people and the environment&mdash;and as a sign that Australian technology can solve problems here and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, immediately, these great public works will help re-start the economy. They will create jobs now, and by the assistance they give to industry, they will still be creating them into the future. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Changing the Tax Rules to Boost</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Investment</PARA>
<PARA>As our industries change, as workplaces are transformed, we will replace old machines with new machines, old factories with new ones. </PARA>
<PARA>Our discussions with business leaders have led us to change the taxation provisions in ways which will make investment in Australian industry more attractive&mdash;particularly the kind of big and durable investments we need. </PARA>
<PARA>From tomorrow the cost of new capital equipment can be fully claimed against tax long before its economic life is over by accelerating rates of depreciation. </PARA>
<PARA>The new rates are particularly generous to long life investment. </PARA>
<PARA>For example, from tomorrow, plant and equipment which lasts twenty years can be effectively claimed over seven and a half years. </PARA>
<PARA>These new schedules mean that from now on Australian tax rules for investment will be more than competitive with comparable countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, we will make other big changes to tax rules for business. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Private Provision of Public</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Infrastructure</PARA>
<PARA>In a landmark reform calculated to greatly improve public infrastructure and take the load off the States and local councils, we will use special tax preferred bonds to encourage private companies to build roads, ports and electricity generating plants. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Equity Development Funds for Small</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">and Medium Businesses</PARA>
<PARA>We will also change the tax system to channel new money into successful and promising smaller businesses which today are unable to attract equity capital, either on the stock exchange or privately. </PARA>
<PARA>To further assist small business we are increasing from 20 per cent to 50 per cent the amount of goodwill exempt from capital gains tax on the sale of a business. And more businesses will qualify for this exemption. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Getting Large Projects Started</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">and Getting Them Finished</PARA>
<PARA>We are going to simplify the environment and heritage reviews which are often involved in big projects by building on the historic environment agreement we have finalised with the States. It will lead to a single environment process for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>With the introduction of a 10 per cent development allowance we will reward big projects which complete the review procedures quickly, which are world competitive and completed within a reasonable time. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Tourism</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, we will change the rules to encourage the tourism industry, one of the great success stories of the 1980s and one of the economic stars of the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA>In the next decade the number of tourists coming to Australia will increase from 2.4 million to 6.5 million. </PARA>
<PARA>That means 200,000 new jobs for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>To meet the demand for accommodation we have made the write-off provisions on tourist-related buildings much more favourable for investment. </PARA>
<PARA>We will also increase financial assistance to the Australian Tourist Commission to promote Australia abroad. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Motor Vehicles</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the recession has had a severe effect on motor vehicle sales. </PARA>
<PARA>From tomorrow the sales tax on new cars currently subject to the 20 per cent rate will be permanently lowered to 15 per cent&mdash;a saving on a new Commodore or Falcon of around $800. </PARA>
<PARA>With cheaper cars we will drive newer cars, which is good for the environment, good for road safety, and good for one of our most important industries. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Banking</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, we are moving to prevent unnecessary foreclosure by banks of viable businesses unable to meet debts. Banks will be able to claim tax deductions for partial debt write-offs and also for losses on debt for equity swaps, allowing firms in difficulty to trade their way out of trouble. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Developing Ideas</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Too few of our research successes are exploited commercially by Australia for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>To help overcome the impediment, we will create an Australian Technology Group, to bid for the rights to publicly fund research projects and sell them on to business. </PARA>
<PARA>The ATG will make the link between good research ideas and good business. </PARA>
<PARA>This will be in addition to the 125 per cent deduction for the costs of research and development which is now a permanent feature of our tax system. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Exporting</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, all of these initiatives will help build a productive base for Australian exports. </PARA>
<PARA>The potential increase in our exports by 1994 is $20 billion. Of this the potential increase to Asia is $13 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>Among the measures we will take to seize this opportunity, the Government will extend Austrade's network throughout the world, and particularly to Asia. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Workplace</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, a nation cannot be strong if at the very point where wealth is made&mdash;the workplace&mdash;people are locked in conflict. </PARA>
<PARA>Modern industry has to be a cooperative process. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a truth we tapped when we began the task of changing the industrial culture of this country, from one in which employers and workers were always at each other's throats, to one in which they now talk about how to do things better. </PARA>
<PARA>We will continue this change and move quickly towards a bargaining system in which higher wages will come from increased efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA>Employers and workers will be free to change workplaces in whatever way is most efficient, and to register their settlements as binding agreements with the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>But basic standards must be met. We will not support slashing minimum wages and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>Our reforms to industrial relations have been the most constructive step this country has taken since the war. </PARA>
<PARA>To stop now, as our opponents are hell bent on doing, would be the most destructive step we could take. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Low Inflation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, our inflation rate is now the second lowest in the world. </PARA>
<PARA>We must keep it low. </PARA>
<PARA>Inflation puts up interest rates, it encourages speculation rather than production, it erodes the value of savings. It is a totally corrupting influence on the fabric of society. </PARA>
<PARA>The bed-rock of the great post-war economies has been low inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>It must be ours too. Labor will never surrender the inflation fight. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, last week the Prime Minister sought and received an assurance from the ACTU that wage claims will enable us to maintain an inflation rate comparable to that of our trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Personal Tax Reform</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>To create the climate of trust and fairness necessary to preserve wage outcomes the nation can afford, and with them low inflation, the Government will lower the tax rates over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA>When these tax reforms are complete more than three-quarters of Australian taxpayers will pay no more than 30 per cent on their last dollar of income. </PARA>
<PARA>A 30 per cent tax rate under Labor, no inflationary consumption tax, no 15 per cent string attached. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, it is almost inconceivable that anyone would contemplate deliberately putting inflation back into the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>But the Leader of the Opposition contemplates it. It is his big idea. </PARA>
<PARA>With a 15 per cent consumption tax and without a wage agreement, even on the admission of one of his own economic consultants, we are back into built-in, double-digit inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>And of course we are back into rising interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, it is just astounding. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Sparking the Recovery</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>One of the objects of this statement is to give the economy the spark it needs by getting spending going again. </PARA>
<PARA>We want to bring forward the recovery without creating an on-going cost to the budget. </PARA>
<PARA>With this in mind, we have decided to boost spending by helping Australians who urgently need to spend&mdash;families with children, including the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, tonight the Prime Minister will ask Parliament to approve a one-off, special payment on 2 April to every family which qualifies for the family allowance. The payment will be $125 for a family with one child, rising to $250 for a family with five or more children. </PARA>
<PARA>As part of the measure, Mr President, the family allowance supplement for low income families will be permanently increased by $3 per child per week at a cost of $240m in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Helping the Hardest Hit</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, we intend to give special assistance to a number of other groups who have been hit hard by the recession. </PARA>
<PARA>We will be increasing the funding for the emergency relief agencies such as the Salvation Army and St Vincent de Paul who shoulder much of the burden of helping the poor and the homeless. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Farmers</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Australian farmers are the most efficient in the world. </PARA>
<PARA>For most of the life of this nation they have provided the economic backbone. They have also borne much of the hardship which uncertain markets and an uncertain climate have inflicted. </PARA>
<PARA>There are two major areas of rural production which have recently gone through difficult times; wool is one, wheat is the other. </PARA>
<PARA>We should nurture these great industries and help farmers during the recovery phase. </PARA>
<PARA>We will allow the Wool Realisation Commission to make cash payments to wool growers in the event that proceeds from the stockpile are surplus to debt repayment requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>We will also provide a one-off addition to the Rural Adjustment Scheme to help wheat and other broad acre growers plant their crops to take advantage of recent rains. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Textile, Clothing and Footwear</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>We are determined to become more competitive, but this will not blind us to the human cost of industrial change. </PARA>
<PARA>We will spend more on helping the textile, clothing and footwear industries to adjust; and we will assist further adjustments by creating opportunities for downstream processing of our wool clip, including the development of new wool-tops production. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Furthering Education</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, in the 1980s the Labor Government made two dramatic changes to education in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>We increased secondary school retention rates and we expanded universities. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1983 less than four out of every 10 young Australians completed 12 years of schooling. </PARA>
<PARA>Today that figure has doubled. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1992 around 500 000 Australians are participating in higher education, an increase of over 120 000 students since 1987&mdash;the equivalent of 12 new universities. </PARA>
<PARA>There has been a revolution both in the way we think about education and in the way we conduct it. </PARA>
<PARA>We are giving more people more chances. We are becoming better equipped to meet the challenges. </PARA>
<PARA>But we cannot be a clever country if we lack the skills and know-how to innovate and deal with problems in the workplace&mdash;if we cannot implement our own ideas. </PARA>
<PARA>From tonight technical or vocational training, the weak reed in Australian education, will become a strand of equal strength. </PARA>
<PARA>We will vastly expand vocational education, so that we will become not just a clever country, but a capable one. </PARA>
<PARA>In conjunction with the States we are offering to build an expanded technical education system where the Commonwealth will fund the whole program. </PARA>
<PARA>With State agreement and Commonwealth money&mdash;an extra $720 million over the next three years&mdash;we can create thousands more places, giving school leavers a chance they would not have had while lifting the quality and status of vocational education. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Training and Support</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, we will also provide training and support to prepare the young, including the young unemployed, for entry to the workforce. </PARA>
<PARA>By raising employer incentives, we will create an extra 9 000 first-year apprenticeship places in 1992; an extra 10 000 places in the Australian Traineeship System, and 7 000 apprentices presently at risk of retrenchment will be retained. </PARA>
<PARA>We will redirect funds to the needs of the long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will provide an extra $100 million to Jobstart creating another 44 000 job opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>We will also provide funding to create jobs in regional Australia, and expand the Jobskills program and other programs of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>As I said at the outset, we have a plan for Australia&mdash;a big plan. With our strategy, within four years the Federal Budget will return to surplus, and we will have created another 800 000 jobs, clipping 3 percentage points off unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>We will have made up our loss in economic growth five times over, and will have done it while keeping inflation low. </PARA>
<PARA>Within four years Australians will be working in one of the best-designed tax systems in the world, and most will be paying a maximum taxation rate of 30 per cent&mdash;without a consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I spoke earlier about the great distances which have for so long separated Australians&mdash;geographical distances, social distances. </PARA>
<PARA>The measures we have announced tonight will help to close the gaps. </PARA>
<PARA>In transport and communications, in workplace reform, in encouraging investment in industries Australia needs, in expanding technical education and in providing help to people in need, we are closing the gaps. </PARA>
<PARA>Labor believes that the community and the economy must advance together: that all our efforts should go towards uniting the country, not dividing it. </PARA>
<PARA>The most successful societies are notable for their unity, for the co-operative quality of all their relationships, from the workplace up. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the kind of Australia we seek, and which we firmly believe we can have. </PARA>
<PARA>An Australia which is more truly one nation. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, we can come out of this recession stronger than we have ever been. </PARA>
<PARA>With low inflation, with strong manufacturing as well as our traditional rural and mining industries, with a new spirit of co-operation, new skills and a new culture of investment and productivity. </PARA>
<PARA>We are now living among the fastest-growing economies in the world. </PARA>
<PARA>For the first time in our history we are close to our major markets&mdash;the chance is there as it has never been before. </PARA>
<PARA>We have the essentials for a strong recovery. </PARA>
<PARA>The measures we have announced tonight will harness them. </PARA>
<PARA>They will harness Australia's talents and energy. </PARA>
<PARA>They will make us stronger. </PARA>
<PARA>They will give back to us our sense of purpose and our confidence. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Arts and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) `The devolved funds' are quite small amounts of money (up to $5 000) for specific purposes, such as for the employment of an artist for a small project or for items such as travel. The Australia Council provides these funds in response to applications. It is not possible at this stage to state the specific projects funded by the $71,200 as this grant was for the 1991 calendar year. The details of each grant made under this program will not be available until acquittal of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Australia Council requires full acquittal of grants thirteen weeks after the completion of a project. Therefore the acquittal on this project is not due until 1 April 1992. The Council will be happy to provide Senator Short with a detailed breakdown of projects conducted by the ACTU after acquittal. The Council has received a full acquittal of projects conducted by the ACTU for the 1989-90 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes. The Australia Council has been devolving funds to peak organisations for over 5 years and has been well satisfied with the effectiveness of this procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as the ACTU, the Australia Council enters into agreements regarding the management of small grants programs with other national organisations, for example, the National Book Council and Arts Training Australia. Organisations which distribute funding on behalf of the Council are subject to the same scrutiny as any client of the Council and the processes they adopt are very carefully reviewed and evaluated by the Boards or Committees that devolve the funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Workers Cultural Action Committee is a committee based in Newcastle, New South Wales. It is made up of artists, delegates of trade unions, retired workers and other interested parties. The Committee encourages and facilitates cultural activity in Newcastle and the Hunter Valley region.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware of the article to which the honourable senator refers. My response to the specific issues raised are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) On the basis of information now available, it is reasonable to conclude that Iraq actively applied to its nuclear weapons development program information gained both from freely available scientific literature and from the normal overseas academic study programs of Iraqi students (including at the Imperial College, London).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Inspections undertaken by International Atomic Energy Agency/United Nations Special Commission (IAEA/UNSCOM) personnel indicate that Iraq was developing concurrently designs for two types of uranium enrichment centrifuge. Both types were at least similar to designs used by URENCO, and an examination of components discovered in Iraq has led the IAEA/UNSCOM inspectors to conclude that substantial assistance was afforded to Iraq by a person, or persons, with knowledge of URENCO-type centrifuges. In the opinion of the IAEA/UNSCOM experts who took part in the relevant 12-15 January 1992 inspection, however, the Iraqis' centrifuge enrichment program had not progressed to the point where they could have started a sizeable production of centrifuges, although, given time, they would have been successful in such production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Article IV of the Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) sets out a moral and political undertaking by Parties to facilitate, and a right for all Parties to participate in, "...the fullest possible exchange of equipment, materials and scientific and technological information for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy." This provision, however, deliberately falls short of setting out an automatic legal "entitlement" to which a Party might appeal in order to receive particular nuclear cooperation benefits, nor does it dictate the terms the relevant parties might mutually agree for such cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Yes, with regard to nuclear material and facilities which had been declared to the IAEA. Iraq's nuclear weapons program essentially was based on undeclared materials and facilities. As a result of the revelations about Iraq's nuclear weapons program, the IAEA and its member states are involved in a major program to strengthen IAEA safeguards, in particular as regards possible undeclared materials and facilities, with the clear aim of avoiding any repeat of the Iraqi experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government believes the experience with Iraq demonstrates the need for, and value of, advanced reporting procedures and comprehensive international export controls for sensitive items. We are seeking actively to strengthen export controls, both through the work of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, of which Australia is a member, and by promoting as a norm the adoption of fullscope safeguards as a requirement for new nuclear supply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is taking a leading role in these efforts, both through bilateral and multilateral consultations with likeminded states and through its position on the IAEA Board of Governors. In September last year, I led the Australian delegation to the IAEA General Conference and emphasised the Government's concern about these issues. At the same conference, Australia took the initiative to introduce a resolution calling for the strengthening of the safeguards system, a resolution which I am pleased to record was adopted by consensus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government intends to maintain its strong support for the IAEA safeguards program and is determined to see prompt and effective action taken to strengthen it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Yes. On 11 October 1991 the United Nations Security Council under its Resolution 715 (1991) accepted an IAEA proposal for the future ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq's compliance with Resolutions 687 and 707 (1991). The former prohibits Iraq's acquisition of, and research and development related to, nuclear weapons and nuclear-weapons-usable material, while the latter prohibits all nuclear activities in Iraq except the use of isotopes for medical, agricultural or industrial purposes. The program set out in Resolution 715 (1991) is designed to provide confirmation that all of Iraq's nuclear capabilities prohibited by Resolution 687 have been destroyed, removed or rendered harmless and assurance that such capabilities are not resurrected in the future by verifying that only those nuclear activities permitted under Resolution 707 are undertaken by Iraq.</PARA>
