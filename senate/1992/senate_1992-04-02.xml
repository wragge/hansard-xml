<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to advise the Senate that an extremely tangible benefit of the Government's restructuring of aviation regulation in Australia is about to be delivered to the industry that it serves. Honourable senators would know that the Civil Aviation Authority, under its extremely competent board and senior management, has been implementing the policy of the Government in undergoing a very major restructuring of the organisation which, over a period of five years, will lead to a reduction of almost half its staff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although that restructuring is fundamentally only in its first completed year, the Civil Aviation Authority is about to advise the aviation industry that it will cut airways charges to the industry in real terms by $96m in the coming financial year and a further $66.5m in real terms in the financial year 1993-94. The charges cover en route air traffic control services, terminal navigation and rescue and fire facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The savings flow from a major restructuring of the organisation of the Authority, including a reduction in staff of over 2,000 over the period January 1991 to 30 June 1992 and the more efficient delivery of services. These significant cuts in staffing levels have been achieved, to the great credit of both management and unions, without any industrial disputation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAA has also adopted the approach of buying systems which are already available and has avoided, where possible, the higher risk and often expensive approach of developing its own systems. The TAATS project is the most recent example of this new approach, I am pleased to say. The dramatic efficiency gains achieved by the CAA in a very short time are to be commended. This further advances the efficiency gains already enjoyed by the aviation industry and the travelling public as a result of the Government's micro-economic reform program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major airlines have cut their own staff by around 30 per cent in the past 12 months and are also carrying 30 per cent more passengers than they were prior to that time. This has flowed through to consumers, with average air fare costs falling significantly since October 1990. The CAA's reduced charges will assist the airlines to operate even more efficiently and maintain these competitive air fares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that a $96m cut in charges in what effectively is the first year of the full impact of the restructuring is to the great credit of the board, the management and the workers of the Civil Aviation Authority.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not agree with Senator Walsh, for all the reasons that were again exhaustively spelt out by Prime Minister Keating and Treasurer Dawkins two days ago in the House of Representatives. To have gone down the path described by Senator Walsh on the tax cuts issue would have been to guarantee unequivocally a blow-out in wages, with all the inflationary impact that would have flowed from that. It was a crucial element in the macro-economic management equation at the time to do as we did on tax cuts. Senator Walsh ought to know that, but he is a little bit unreconstructed on some of these issues.

In an environment where the balance of payments has turned around quite fundamentally, producing figures which demonstrate that the exports of this country are dramatically expanding, particularly in the area of elaborately transformed manufactures, where this is not in any way a product of the recession, in a situation where inflation has come down to a measured rate of 1 1/2 per cent and an underlying rate of 3 1/2 per cent, in an environment where the economy has come out of recession, is moving back into growth and where we can expect 4 per cent growth this year, in an environment where a massive amount of  micro-economic reform is taking place, in an environment where confidence has returned to the political equation and the Government and where the Opposition is absolutely on its knees with despair as a result, I can understand its wanting to engage in some diversionary manoeuvres of this kind, but there is no credibility in its position now and there never has been.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Loosley would no doubt have seen a report in yesterday's newspapers suggesting that the United States trade representative, Carla Hills, released an indicative watch list of countries which the United States considered were costing its exporters millions of dollars. The report suggested that six pages of the report had been devoted to Australia's sins. This matter was raised with me by United States officials twice two weeks ago today. It was raised by firstly Barbara Franklin, who is the new United States Secretary of Commerce, and by Carla Hills's deputy as trade representative, Mr Moskow. They both suggested that if we were to proceed with any Australian content rules on pay television, they would be particularly horrified. They also suggested that our rules on advertising, even the recently liberalised ones, and our rules for Australian content quotas on free to air television now were in some way hindrances to their trade. I took particular offence to that line, given the real relationship between the two countries in trade overall, but particularly in film and television production.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pointed out to both august United States representatives that we were generously allowed to compete for about 8 per cent of their sugar market and 2 per cent of their dairy market and no more. They were able to wage war on our wheat farmers in markets all around the world and even on the very question that they were raising with me, the United States provides about 80 per cent of Australian imports of television and film and there is, of course, only a tiny percentage of ours going over there. In fact, the trade deficit just on this one matter, that is film and television, is about $316m on the last available figures. So the United States, with its massive entertainment industry, is able to have a huge trade surplus with Australia on this one question, yet any attempt by Australia to have local content rules to make sure that our own identity, our own culture, is in some way protected will apparently bring about retaliation from the biggest brother.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that Australian drama&mdash;the centrepiece of local content rules&mdash;accounted for 597 hours out of 4,914 hours available across the three networks in 1988-89. So we are looking at only one-eighth of the time on drama being taken by Australian drama because of local content rules and the United States wants to tell us that it thinks that is too much. Anyone who has watched the latest cultural offering from the United States, a program called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Studs</EMPHASIS>, gets an idea of what we can get from the United States and what we are getting from it is anything but a fair deal. This is hypocrisy on a grand scale, not a small scale. I made it very clear to it that that was the view of not just the Government but of every thinking Australian.</PARA>

I remind the Minister of the guarantee he gave as Minister for Social Security on 5 June last year that, if unemployed people met their obligations under the Job Search activity test, no restriction would be placed on the number of hours of part time voluntary work they could do. I ask the Minister, firstly: is he aware that, despite his assurances, this is not how the Department is interpreting the legislation in practice and that unemployed people throughout the country are being threatened with the loss of their Job Search or Newstart allowances because they are allegedly doing too much voluntary work? Secondly, does the Minister think it is fair to continue to penalise unemployed people who are trying to help themselves and the community?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recall a discussion on this matter last year, so I can certainly confirm that. Obviously, during a recession when unemployment numbers are very high, it is particularly important to allow for voluntary work and not to be overly harsh on those who participate in it, remembering always that the basic test for receipt of unemployment benefit is being available for full time work. I do not think one can undermine the test significantly, but certainly there is room at the margin for movement. I thought that movement had been occurring. I shall inquire from the Minister, Dr Blewett, whether or not it has been occurring and I will attempt to answer Senator Lees's question when the Senate resumes in two weeks time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen claims by the Opposition that savings of that magnitude could be made out of the Overseas Property Group's budget. In the Opposition's consumption tax package there is a claim that $20m can be saved out of that budget of $130m. Up until the last couple of days we have proceeded on the basis that those savings could have been made, as was indicated in the Fightback document, by the process of commercialisation or contracting out. The only problem has been&mdash;as I indicated two days ago&mdash;that, of the $130m budget for the Overseas Property Group, already $127m is contracted out to the private sector. So, if one believed the Fightback package, that degree of savings would have to be made out of an all-up sum of $3.3m. Obviously, that is impossible.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He now says that is right. If the Liberals by some chance get into power, there will be a reduction in the Overseas Property Group's budget of $20m. Leaving aside the basic inconsistency between Senator Parer's statement the day before yesterday and the Fightback document, and leaving aside the fact that the Opposition has ditched the approach it was going to take in this area of the commercialisation process reducing costs by $20m, let us allow the Opposition the indulgence of being able to cut $20m from the Overseas Property Group's budget by a reduction in running costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two problems with that, and I think the Senate ought to be aware of them. First of all, when one impacts on recurrent costs, one impacts on costs for which we have been committed and for which we are committed under legal obligation. Whether we are committed to residences, offices or whatever, we have contractual obligations. So, mechanically it is not that easy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, however, another problem with the proposal, and that comes from the basic situation that the Opposition does not really understand what its proposal here entails. I am really sorry that Senator Hill is not at the table to listen to this, because it impacts directly on his shadow portfolio interests. If we were to cut the Overseas Property Group's budget by $20m, we would have to cut out 47 of our 74 overseas posts; that is, two-thirds of our representation overseas would have to be reduced. This would impact in a number of ways. Regionally, the Opposition would have to close posts in Fiji, Kiribati, Micronesia, Myanmar, New Caledonia, New Zealand, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu, and Vietnam.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot anticipate what a sham contract might be, given all the permutations of a sham contract, just as the Taxation Commissioner cannot necessarily anticipate all the ways in which tax avoiders find loopholes in the Act. It is for that reason that I wish to clothe the Industrial Relations Commission with the power to look at the particular allegations about whether there is a sham contract or not; to examine the evidence in each particular case; and, based on that examination, and the hearing of the views of the parties, to make a decision whether the contract is a true contract or whether that contract is a sham contract. It is simply because no-one can anticipate the ingenuity of people in this area, and all of the permutations. It needs a case by case study and an independent inquiry based on the Commission to determine it. That is the answer to the first part of the supplementary question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the supplementary question is: what is custom and practice in this case? Again, in each particular case it would be a question of examining the particular features of that industry or that area of employment. Since people in the housing industry knee jerked into a response before they had spoken to me about the matter yesterday, might I say that custom and practice in the housing industry, in the cottage industry, is by and large a question of subcontract labour. That industry is not by and large a province for award coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is a matter of this character being brought before the Commission for determination, I imagine that the Commission will have regard to what is the prevailing custom and practice in that particular industry. If it were housing, that would be subcontractors, not awards. But in other areas the custom and practice may well be different. On a multi-storey construction site in the middle of the central business district of a capital city, custom and practice would be award coverage. Should people wish to then try to break that down by introducing sham contracts, the Commission would have regard to that area of award coverage and award against the so-called independent contractors.</PARA>

The protection that we are talking about is one that after 1996 will amount on products generally to an average rate of five per cent, which will amount to 15 per cent so far as the automobile industry is concerned by the year 2000, and will amount to 25 per cent maximum so far as TCF is concerned. It is a 5, 15, 25 set of rates that we are talking about, as distinct from the zero, zero, zero rates that are being proposed in a scorched earth fashion by the Opposition. That is the difference between the Opposition and the Government. It is a difference, when you look at it in the larger context, that is at the margin of the debate about protection because the Government's anti-protectionist credentials are and will remain absolutely impeccable. We are the Government that has succeeded in bringing down rates very dramatically from the absurdly high and counterproductive levels that were being maintained through the Opposition's years of government. We are the Government that is getting rid of quotas completely from all areas of industry sectors by 1993.

Can the Minister tell us how many jobs are likely to be affected; how many positions and high level functions will be transferred interstate; and, if efficiency is the name of the game, why penalise the remarkably efficient Tasmanian operation and lump it in with the less efficient one?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not certain of the exact decision for Tasmania, but as a general rule Telecom has been asked to perform up to world's best practice. That will mean some changes to the organisation over the next few years. Some of those changes no doubt will involve the removal of some people from some regional areas. It will be a case of looking at efficiency, but also balanced against what Telecom can lose by moving people out of those areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give some examples, there are places in Australia where regional offices are staffed for such things as repairs or complaints. Often those offices are not staffed 24 hours a day, but for only part of the day, and there is simply no efficiency in maintaining them. Most of those though are fairly small operations and I doubt very much if any involve more than a handful of jobs, and nothing like 300. Although rationalisation will be taking place, one also has to balance it against what one will lose. With a competitor looming up in Optus over the next couple of years, Telecom has to be concerned that whatever decisions it takes do not lead to lots of people switching en masse to the competitor because of Telecom's own actions. Therefore, I am trying to sort out with the Managing Director and the Chairman of Telecom the policy that Telecom will adopt on this question. It was one of the matters that I raised with them yesterday morning. I expect to have an answer by the time the Parliament resumes in three weeks and will be happy to share the results of that with Senator Harradine.</PARA>

Secondly, could the Minister inform the Senate how he considers it possible to conduct a study of an area of 10,000 square miles of Australia for $111,000 and not involve consultation with the pastoralists on the Nullarbor? Will the study that is being undertaken consider the economic impact of World Heritage listing of the Nullarbor? Finally, when will the Government make a decision on the nomination of this area?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the last part of Senator Lewis's question is no. The rest of the information also, I must say, is badly flawed. The difficulties that have been raised by the licensed aircraft maintenance engineers have got nothing whatever to do with the air traffic control purchase and tendering currently being arranged by the board of the Civil Aviation Authority. I do not know where Senator Lewis could have got that information from. The engineers' problems have to do with the restructuring of the Civil Aviation Authority, which, as I advised the House today, has already this year resulted in a $96m decrease in charges by the Civil Aviation Authority to the aviation industry.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Thank you, Mr President. I thank the Senate. Yesterday, I asked Senator Collins&mdash;he will remember, I am sure&mdash;the following question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How can the Minister for Shipping and Aviation justify the claim that he is achieving waterfront reform when I have been provided with two quotes: firstly, to ship a 20-foot container loaded with household effects from Hobart to Tilbury, London, at the cost of $A2,000; and, secondly, to ship that same container from Hobart to Brisbane for the cost of $3,500?</PARA>
<PARA>In answer, Senator Collins said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The difficulty with the question is that the shipping rates from Australia to London have absolutely nothing whatever to do with waterfront reform. In fact, the total component of stevedoring costs on a sea journey of that length would be less than one per cent. The question of shipping freight rates, I repeat, which was the gravamen of the question, is almost totally unrelated to waterfront reform or stevedoring costs.</PARA>
<PARA>That answer shows the Minister's ignorance. Let me give the Senate some information. I have substantiated that just under 50 per cent of charges are land-based. Twenty-six per cent of charges are Australian land-based, not one per cent or `less than one per cent'. Twenty-three per cent of charges are European land-based. The 23 per cent are the Hamburg costs, but it is uniform all over Europe. If the Minister would now like to direct his `less than one per cent' being land based, I would appreciate the opportunity of getting him to do so. I challenge him to say that I am totally wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am well aware that the Minister has also been told of this because Transport contacted the same sources that I did. I will be most interested in the Minister's answer. Is he going to change it from `less than one per cent', or what percentage does the Minister now claim applies?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to respond very briefly to provide Senator Walters with some additional information. One does not have to be an expert on waterfront or shipping to realise that the assertion that of the freight charge for shipping a container from Australia to London&mdash;a sea journey of 12,000 miles&mdash;60 per cent would be land-based charges is pretty extraordinary.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me finish, Senator Hill. I will be brief. The reason that Transport contacted the source is that, out of courtesy to Senator Walters or any senator who asks questions in here, I try to get the most complete answer that I can. I have some additional information which I will now provide. It needs to be made clear that comparisons of shipping freight rates&mdash;and that was the problem; not the waterfront stevedoring charges&mdash;such as these are fraught with difficulties, as I have pointed out to the Senate many times before. Great care needs to be taken to ensure that like is compared with like, as I have also pointed out many times before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Freight charges are struck as a result of commercial negotiation between the customer and the shipping company. As a result of that commercial negotiation, the rates will vary very significantly in this industry&mdash;and they do&mdash;even for similar containers over the same route, for any number of reasons, including seasonal demands on shipping space, the relative level of shipping services and the overall balance of exports and imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of moving a container from Hobart to Brisbane cannot readily be compared with the cost of moving a similar container to Tilbury in England. For a start, there is no direct shipping service from Hobart to Brisbane, and the cost, whichever route is taken, will include significant elements of land transport charges; that is, from Hobart to Brisbane, not from Hobart to Tilbury in England. Information supplied by my Department suggests that the $2,000 quote to Tilbury is low. The charge quoted from Hobart to Brisbane is more difficult to judge, as it includes significant land transport movements. Using the most direct shipping service, Hobart to Sydney, the average wharf-to-wharf charge is currently around $1,375. The container would then need to be transferred by either road or rail to Brisbane. If the quote is accurate, $2,100 of the charge could represent the land transport component or other ancillary charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be made clear that very little of the overall charge in either of these cases, or indeed the difference between them, has anything to do, as I said yesterday, with the cost of stevedoring. Stevedoring represents a small proportion of the total freight charge. The average stevedoring charge in Australia currently, because of the significant reduction, of somewhere near 30 per cent in the last 12 months in this charge, is now somewhere between $180 and $200 per container. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must comment on the irresponsibility of a Minister who attacks one of his own colleagues and then runs from the chamber. What Senator Lewis is talking about is a very important point. With respect to the allegations by Senator Collins, if he had taken the trouble to read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> yesterday&mdash;because once more he was not in the chamber when matters which vitally affected him were raised&mdash;he would have seen that what I said was that he gave an incomplete answer. I did not say that he categorically misled the House. Later on I said, `To that extent, namely with respect to his transponder argument, he certainly misled the Senate'. How it is written up in the paper is not my concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic point is this: in any modern air traffic control radar system there is a primary radar which detects and shows the presence of aircraft; there is an SSR, a secondary surveillance radar, which interrogates an instrument in the aircraft, the transponder, and it identifies that particular aircraft. It appears&mdash;and this is a very important point&mdash;that there is a basic fault in the Thomson-CSF systems. The fault is that when four zeros are set on the transponder, or if perhaps the transponder has some faults in it&mdash;in other words, the pilot sets the code he is asked to set and a different signal is transmitted&mdash;this brilliant Thomson system&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It tells the signal coming in from the secondary surveillance radar to ignore the primary surveillance signal that an aircraft is present, and indicates that there is no aircraft there. The aircraft then becomes invisible on the radar screen. The system that Senator Collins and the CAA have bought for us&mdash;the radar systems provided by Thomson-CSF and installed now at Cairns, Coolangatta, Mount Macedon and Gellibrand&mdash;all have this basic flaw in their systems. Apparently the new TAAATS system of Thomson-CSF, which will be an Australia-wide system, similarly has this flaw in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That raises some very important points. The first is, despite what Senator Collins says, very exhaustive checks were made, not only of that F28 aircraft but three Qantas 767s which also were invisible. No mechanical or electronic fault was shown in those aircraft. The second very important point is that the F28 and the three Qantas Boeing 767s, within a short space of time, both preceding and after the Cairns event, flew through one or all of Darwin, Brisbane and Sydney airspaces. The radar systems in Darwin, Sydney and Brisbane are all very old hat. They are at least 20 years old. Yet all those aircraft flew through and were correctly identified on the radar screens by the air traffic controllers at those airfields at the time with the air traffic control radars. So it is a reasonable presumption that there was not a fault with the transponders in those aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the significance of it. If Senator Collins has bought a system where one can dial up four zeros on a transponder and become invisible, or get a pretence or a presentation of invisibility on the air traffic control radars, what a bonus it is for drug runners coming into Australia. They just have to dial up four zeros on the transponder, and fly into Cairns with invisibility&mdash;as we know drug runners are doing in north Australia at present. Think of all the billions of dollars the Americans could save on their stealth technology with their defence aircraft if they had a radar system in the hands of the enemy with that sort of nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other argument that is advanced by Senator Collins and his people is the fact that some of these aircraft, like the Boeing 767, have two radar aerials for their transponders; one on top of the aircraft and one on the bottom of the aircraft. They say, `Well, you get interference with the propagation of the radar signal'. Again the evidence is against that. Boeing 767s have been in extensive use around the world for about 10 years. The problem has not appeared anywhere other than at Cairns and Coolangatta. In this particular case the aircraft flew through Sydney, Brisbane and Darwin and there was no problem at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bring this fact to Senator Collins's attention because he will never bring it to the attention of the Senate: the great Thomson-CSF system at Cairns, which has a recorded history of something like 23 or 26 significant failures since it was installed and which, of course, is 20 months over time on its installation, on three days in the last month had significant shutdown times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 25 March the primary radar was shut down for 4 hours 55 minutes while the magnetron was replaced, and it was replaced because when the system was bought the CAA accepted the Thomson-CSF proposition that it be a magnetron rather than a kylstron, which is at the heart of the radar system, the transmitter. On the next day, 26 March, the primary radar was shut down for 1 hour 26 minutes. On the third day, 27 March, the primary radar was shut down for a motor change for three minutes. That is a total of three shutdowns in three consecutive days totalling 6 hours 24 minutes, and all this from a new radar installation which was supposed to meet a requirement of four minutes down time per calendar year. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that I will have the answers to the questions this afternoon prior to Estimates hearings.</PARA>
<PARA>The bottom line was that the Estimates Committee was not provided with those answers at the hearing, until 15 minutes past midnight and after considerable prompting. I take this opportunity to read to the Senate a letter that I received from the Estimates Committee secretary in response to a number of queries I made as to when those answers were going to be forthcoming. The letter, dated 31 March 1992, reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator O'Chee,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Questions on Notice</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Transport and Communications has informed me today that answers to your questions on notice for the CAA were expected to be signed by the Minister this afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister held on to those answers from Question Time right through until midnight. Just before midnight they still had not come out of the Minister's office. I asked the Committee secretary again where the answers were. They were sitting in the Minister's office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did the Minister hold onto the answers? Because he did not want the detailed answers to come back to honourable senators so that we could check those answers and check the truth and the accuracy of some of the technical answers and responses that related to those questions on notice. We are seeing Senator Collins not only misleading the Senate but also trying his damnedest to ensure that the information that Estimates committees require and that honourable senators require is not presented to them in a timely fashion so that they can verify it before they go on to having an Estimates hearing that kicks off on aviation at 4 o'clock in the morning. That is what Senator Collins is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we got to the hearing, we found that some of the answers that were given to the questions on notice were incorrect anyway, because those answers, again, attempted to trot out the same old line that the only fault was in the transponder. The gentleman from the CAA, Mr Kendall, admitted that not only 0000 transponder codes but also any transponder code ending in a double zero could lead to the aircraft not appearing on the radar at all. He admitted that it could not fix it at the moment and it could give no assurance that the aircraft would not continue to disappear off radar screens. I suggest that considerable opprobrium attaches to a Minister who holds on to answers which subsequently turn out to be incorrect, but which may have been found to be even more incorrect if senators on this side of the chamber had been given a decent opportunity to check the accuracy and veracity of those answers before they went on to a 4 a.m. hearing on aviation in the Estimates Committee. </PARA>

What is happening is that the Minister is trying to jump to a new, untried system and there is great concern about its safety. There is great concern, in particular, about the system which is operated by Thomson. I think Senator MacGibbon said that on 26 occasions there have been failures and breakdowns in the system. This involves much cost to the Australian people. It cost $5.5m in Melbourne to try to fix up the system. We now have the Minister continually misleading the Senate about the safety of the Thomson contract. The CAA is proceeding to negotiate the terms of the contract with the preferred contractor&mdash;it is not going to be an open tendering system&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Loosley,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On behalf of the 217 Residents of the Cardinal Gilroy Retirement Village whose signatures appear on the attachment, we have taken the opportunity of writing to you as one of our respected parliamentarians, seeking your support of the endeavours of the silent majority of Australian citizens in opposing the ready availability of violent and pornographic materials in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are confident that you will not discount our representation on the basis of our being only a group of oldies from one Retirement Village (not even in your own electorate) because, as we are sure you will appreciate, we are representative of the whole community given the extent and disbursement of our families with whom we have regular contact. Further, we are sincere, experienced, senior Australians well qualified to understand the marked decline of social and moral standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are concerned about our children's and grandchildren's future when much of what is offered to them as entertainment seems to rely heavily either on excessive violence or else on near pornographic use of human sexuality. Is the result of this dubious entertainment the increasing levels of violent crime which we are now witnessing within Australia? (Please refer to the essay by Robert Manne on page 46 of the January 6th, 1992 issue of Time Magazine.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that it is time that a wide ranging Parliamentary enquiry into violent and pornographic entertainment be established. Are you prepared to support its establishment and ensure that the recommendations flowing from the enquiry are acted upon?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will you join us in opposing the ready availability of violent and pornographic material (especially that coming from the A.C.T.) in order to make Australia a better place for us and our families&mdash;the very future of Australia?</PARA>

Even focussing on the major republics in the region has meant looking at the many and various aspects of Australia's relations with eight or so countries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>One of the instruments provides extensive safeguards for persons who elect to pay an administrative fine for an offence rather than have the matter dealt with by a court. However, there is no provision for persons affected to be notified of these safeguards, which may mean the difference between, on the one hand, paying a fine of $200 and not having a conviction recorded or being convicted and, on the other, paying a fine of $1,000 or being sentenced to imprisonment for six months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another instrument provides for garnishee of wages, salaries and bank accounts with no immediate indication of appropriate safeguards. The third instrument provides for appointments to an important statutory authority to be terminated `at the pleasure of the Minister'. The Committee will seek an explanation of these apparently defective provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a statement of the concerns of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Fisheries Management Regulations Statutory Rules 1992 No. 20</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Regulations implement administrative details of the Fisheries Management Act 1991, providing for the administration of fishing concessions, operation of boats and equipment and surveillance and enforcement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations provide for certain offences to be dealt with by an administrative fine, rather than a penalty imposed by a court, in the same way that numbers of minor traffic offences, such as parking, are dealt with. If a member of the public elects to pay an administrative fine then the Regulations properly provide extensive and adequate safeguards. These are that the person's liability in relation to the offence is taken to be discharged, further proceedings cannot be taken against the person and the person is not to be regarded as having been convicted of the offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the beneficial effect of these appropriate safeguards may not be enjoyed by persons accused of offences, as there is no provision for them to be informed of these rights. An entire regulation prescribes what must be included in infringement notices sent to persons affected, but this does not include notification of these valuable safeguards. The Committee considers that personal rights are only effective if properly communicated. In this case it would appear that such notification rights are essential.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the present case the matter is particularly important because of a great disparity in penalties. The administrative fine for any offence cannot exceed $200, yet the penalties imposed by a court for the same offences range from, in one case, a fine of $500, in six cases a fine of $1,000 and in an unspecified number of possible cases imprisonment for six months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has also given a notice of disallowance in respect of similar provisions in the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) (Modifications of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1991 No. 397, relating to failure to vote in elections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">   Ministerial Guidelines Under s.44 of the                Student Assistance Act 1973</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Guidelines relate to management of debts due to the Commonwealth in respect of student assistant schemes. Although the instrument is called Guidelines, the parent Act requires that these be observed by the Minister and other officers. The concerns of the Committee relate to personal liberties, appropriate review rights and legal validity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the Guidelines grant important discretions. Thus, there are provisions for an officer to review an objection to a withholding from an entitlement. There is also provision for a debtor to satisfy the Department of a matter within seven days. Another provision appears to grant a discretion as to whether failure to pay a debt was the fault of the debtor. There are other discretions to write off a debt entirely, to waive a debt, and to approve repayment by instalments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of these discretions provide criteria for their exercise. However, these criteria themselves include other discretions. Some discretions are subject to presumably internal review. However, there is no indication whether any of these discretions are subject to merits review by an independent tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the discretions have serious implications for personal rights. Thus, one provision is that a section of the Act may be used to garnishee deductions from salary or wages or from an account at a bank or other financial institution. In this case the Committee would wish to be satisfied that the provision is justified by the parent Act and that there are appropriate safeguards for a person affected, including independent review of the merits of any action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Guidelines only relate to the exercise of powers under the parent Act. That Act includes extensive review provisions and it may be that the discretions in these Guidelines are included in decisions made under the Act and are subject to such review. However, the Committee would wish to receive express confirmation of this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Guidelines HSB 3/1992 under s.82F of the <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">National Health Act 1953</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Guidelines, among other things, provide for the appointment of the Commissioner, other members and deputies to the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. This is a statutory body with important functions and wide powers. The PHIAC is also a body corporate, which may hold and dispose of personal property and may sue and be sued in its corporate name.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Guidelines provide that the period of appointment shall be "at the pleasure of the Minister". Although such expressions were used in the past, the Committee now regards them as archaic and generally inappropriate. Such appointees should be only removed for proven misbehaviour or physical, mental or other forms of incapacity. The Committee is always vigilant to protect personal rights and liberties. In this case the personal reputations of persons could suffer if they were removed without reasonable cause. This would be particularly serious for appointees to the PHIAC who presumably will be eminent people. In this context the Committee noted that the Commissioner may be appointed on a full-time basis. On its face, it is not acceptable for a full-time Commissioner of an important statutory authority, together with all of his or her members and deputies, to hold office at the pleasure of the Minister. In addition, the independence of action of the appointees would appear to be compromised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that it may be appropriate to obtain an undertaking to amend the Guidelines to meet its concerns.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA  ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to VHF High Band Frequency Plan (148 to 174 MHz) and VHF Mid Band Frequency Plan (70 to 87.5 MHz), Statutory Rules 1991 Nos.354 and 355, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 27 February 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both Plans and their Explanatory Statements are very similar in content and wording, apart from one dealing with high band and the other with mid band frequencies. The following comments therefore relate generally to both sets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clauses 7(3) and 9(3) provide for important discretions. Clause 7 provides for channelling arrangements for band segments, but then clause 7(3) provides that different arrangements may be authorised to "provide for more efficient use of the spectrum". There are no criteria in the instrument itself to guide and control the exercise of this discretion, although there are criteria in a Note, which does not appear to be part of the Plans. It is usual to include such criteria in the provisions of the instrument itself. Also, there does not seem to be any indication of who is to exercise this discretion, apart from the Notes, and no reference in the instrument to any review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 9(3) provides for exemption from compliance with clauses 6 and 7. The Committee accepts that these exemptions may be authorised only until the relevant conversion date, but these run until 1 July 1998. Again, there seems to be no criteria in respect of the discretion, no procedures for its exercise and no indication of review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The General Notes and Notes are generally helpful. Users are assisted by such material. However, as mentioned earlier, some of the contents of the Notes may have been better included in the instruments themselves. This category includes Note 6 on page 9 of Statutory Rules 1991 No.354, which appears to be legislative in nature. Note 6 also appears to give a discretion to the Secretary or to a delegate of the Secretary. There are discretions in Notes 3 and 5 with no indication of any review of these discretions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, clause 4 specifies conversion dates. However, General Notes 4 and 8 provide that each Regional Office of the Department will develop and manage the detailed conversion program and that "individual users will be required by the relevant Regional Office to convert their service earlier than the relevant State conversion date". This appears to include an element of compulsion which is not provided for in the legislation. Admittedly, General Note 9 sets out some criteria for conversion. Nevertheless, the Committee asks whether this discretionary compulsion is authorised by the parent Act. Again, if it is authorised, is there any review of the compulsory requirement?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above points and whether you feel that it may be worthwhile to undertake future amendment of the Plans.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA   ACT   2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Giles</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 28 February 1992 to the Minister for Transport and Communications concerning the VHF High Band Frequency Band Plan (148 to 174 MHz), Statutory Rules 1991 No.354, and the VHF Mid Band Frequency Band Plan (70 to 87.5 MHz), Statutory Rules 1991 No.355, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 27 February 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The Minister has asked me to respond on his behalf particularly as it was I who made the Plans on behalf of the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. As you have observed, both Plans are very similar in content and wording, and the following comments in relation to the Committee's concerns about the Plans relate generally to both Plans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The making of Frequency Band Plans</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. The Radiocommunications Act 1983 (The Act) establishes the statutory framework for management of the radio frequency spectrum in Australia. A key element in the Act relates to the making of frequency band plans. Band planning is the mechanism by which spectrum allocation can be adjusted to provide additional capacity for both new and existing services. The process of making band plans has been adopted as a means of coordinating changes in spectrum usage in a manner which provides for the maximum amount of consultation with users and which avoids the need for achieving change through the abrupt cancellation or non-renewal of licences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. The statutory requirements for public consultation in sections 19 and 20 of the Act are really minimum requirements and in practice it is necessary to have a far more extensive process of consultation throughout the development of new band plans. The making of the VHF plans was the culmination of about three years of development involving a number of intermediate levels of consultation with industry and users. The formal gazetting for full public comment in May 1991, in accordance with the Act, was the final step in the consultation process. It resulted in a number of significant changes, particularly in regard to minimising changeover costs to existing users.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Decision-making context of the Plans</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. Before specifically addressing the Committee's concerns about the Plans, I would like to make some comments on the decision-making context in which the Plans operate. The two main types of decisions made under the Act where a decision-maker will refer to the Plans are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)under section 24 and subsection 25(1) of the Act, when deciding whether or not to grant a transmitter licence authorising a person to operate a transmitter on a particular frequency; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)under subsection 25(3) of the Act, when deciding whether or not to vary a condition of a transmitter licence by changing the frequency on which the licensee is authorised to operate a transmitter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. It is relevant to note that paragraph 24(2)(c) of the Act provides that in exercising his or her licensing powers, the Minister shall have regard to whether or not he or she is satisfied that the proposed operation of the transmitters is in accordance with the appropriate frequency band plan. Also, paragraph 25(1)(a) provides that a transmitter licence is subject to the condition that the holder of the licence shall not operate, or permit the operation of, the transmitter except for a purpose specified in the licence, being a purpose not inconsistent with a purpose of a kind specified in the appropriate frequency band plan under subsection 19(2).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. Decisions made under section 24 and 25 of the Act are subject to internal departmental review and subsequent review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal by virtue of section 86 of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9. Other decisions made with reference to the Plans relate to test permits (section 10), frequency reservation certificates (section 21), and temporary permits (section 35). All these decisions are similarly subject to review under section 86 of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10. It is important to note that all operative decisions made with reference to the Plans are made under one of the abovementioned sections of the Act (the `substantive' powers)&mdash;none are actually made under the Plans themselves. Where the Plans provide for discretions on divergence from the purposes for which any particular segment of the radio frequency spectrum may be used, those discretions are actually exercised under one of the above sections. The Plans in themselves do not create any new non-reviewable discretions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 7(3)&mdash;criteria for allowing different channelling arrangements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11. In your letter, you mention that the criteria, which may be taken into account in exercising the discretion of whether to allow channelling arrangements other than as provided for in the Plans, are set out in a Note which does not appear to be part of the Plans. You also comment that there is no indication of who is to exercise this discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12. Taking your second comment first, those officers in the Department who are delegates of the Minister in relation to the `substantive' powers of the Act will be the officers who may exercise the discretion when exercising those powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13. In relation to your first comment, the criteria set out in the Note are meant as a guide only, without intending to limit the range of matters which may be relevant to considering whether a proposal would provide for more efficient use of the spectrum. It is expected that in each individual case, the particular circumstances of that case are considered in deciding whether to exercise the discretion. As the discretion is exercised as part of the exercise of a reviewable `substantial' power under the Act, should an affected person consider that an irrelevant consideration has been taken into account, or that a relevant consideration has not been taken account, that person would have a right of review under section 86 of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 9(3)&mdash;exemption from clauses 6 and 7</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14. In your letter, you comment that there is no indication of the relevant criteria for, or procedures for the exercise of, the discretion to provide a temporary exemption from clauses 6 and 7 of the Plans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15. You will note that subclause 3(3) of the Plans provides that wherever `authorised' is used in the Plans, this refers to an authorisation given by the Secretary of the Department, or by an officer of the Department authorised in writing by the Secretary, for the relevant purpose. It is intended that the `authorised officers' will be the more senior delegates of the Minister for the purposes of the `substantive' powers under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16. Subclause 9(3) makes it clear that temporary exemptions under this clause may only be granted for the purpose of facilitating implementation of the Plans. As there are many services which are affected by the Plans, it is impossible to anticipate at this time the detailed movements of services in each city or State which will be necessary in order to meet the conversion dates set out in the Plans. As you noted in your statement to the Senate on 3 March 1992, the General Note in clause 2 of the Plans sets out measures to minimise the impact of the cost and disruption for users in converting to compliance with the Plans. These measures are meant as a guide to the decision-makers in each State and Territory exercising the `substantive' powers in the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17. It is relevant to note that subclause 9(3) is in a very similar form to subclause 11(4) of the Radiocommunications-Australian Spectrum Plan, Statutory Rules 1990 No.413, which provides that, subject to subclause 11(1) of that Plan, each frequency band may be used by services other than those identified in the Spectrum Plan on a transitional basis to facilitate new or revised allocations of frequency bands.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Note 6, page 9 of Statutory Rules 1991 No.354</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18. In your letter, you comment that Note 6 appears to be legislative in character, and appears to give a discretion to the Secretary or to an officer authorised by the Secretary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">19. You will note that Items 14 and 19 of Table 2 refer the reader to Note 6. In so far as Note 6 has any substantive effect, it can only operate in the context of an exercise of one of the substantive (and reviewable) powers under the Act. Those notes which are included as a guide and are not operative provisions of the Plans are identified by being enclosed in square brackets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">20. Again, the discretion is subject to review under section 86 of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notes 3 and 5, page 11 of Statutory Rules 1991 No.354</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">21. In your letter, you refer to Notes 3 and 5, and comment that they provide for discretions but do not appear to provide for review of those discretions. I assume you were referring to those Notes on page 11 of Statutory Rules 1991 No.354.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">22. I refer you to my comments in paragraphs 6&mdash;10 and 15 above.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 4&mdash;conversion dates&mdash;General Notes 4 and 8</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">23. In your letter, you ask whether the discretion to compel a user to convert before the relevant conversion date is authorised by the Act, and whether there is any review of each a compulsion decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">24. Again I refer you to my comments in paragraphs 6&mdash;10 above.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">25. I trust that the above comments meet the Committee's concerns. It may be helpful if the General Notes in the Plans were amended to include a message to the effect that the notes are intended as a guide to decision-makers when making decisions under the Act. I understand such a change would not require compliance with the extended consultation procedures for making frequency band plans required by sections 19 and 20 of the Act, because the General Notes are not part of the provisions of the Plans. I would be happy to make myself and officers of my Department available to meet with the Committee to further discuss the matter should the Committee so desire.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! The Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, Senator Zakharov, has written to me and formally raised as a matter of privilege under standing order 81 the alleged intimidation of witnesses which is the subject of the report which the Committee has just presented. The essence of the matters raised in the report is that certain witnesses have been threatened in consequence of evidence given before the Committee. The Committee has recommended that the matter be referred to the Privileges Committee, and Senator Zakharov has asked that I give precedence to a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under standing order 81 and the privilege resolutions of the Senate, I am required to consider whether a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee should have precedence over all other business, having regard to the following criteria:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">(a) the principle that the Senate's power to adjudge and deal with contempts should be used only where it is necessary to provide reasonable protection for the Senate and its committees and for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>senators against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct them in the performance of their functions, and should not be used in respect of matters which appear to be of a trivial nature or unworthy of the attention of the Senate; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">(b) the existence of any remedy other than that power for any act which may be held to be a contempt.</PARA>
<PARA>Having considered the report of the Committee, I believe that the matters raised by the Committee clearly are capable of being regarded by the Senate as meeting the criterion in paragraph (a), and that there is no other readily available remedy. The Senate has always taken extremely seriously any suggestion of improper interference with witnesses and has invariably referred such matters to the Privileges Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore determine that a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee may have precedence over all other business.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This reference was one of two given to the Committee relating to services for people with disabilities; the first of these reports, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Accommodation for People with Disabilities</EMPHASIS>, was tabled in May 1990. The inquiry into the reference on employment predated that report and hearings extended over the period early 1989 to late 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over that time, there have been considerable changes in service provision and in development of new services. The Commonwealth/State Disability Agreement, signed in mid-1991, has clarified the respective Commonwealth and State/Territory responsibilities, with accommodation and related services being provided by the States, and employment services being a Commonwealth responsibility. This reflects the belief of many witnesses that it is essential for employment services for people with disabilities to be operated by the Commonwealth, which has the major responsibility for employment and labour-market programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many witnesses also believed that departments such as the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) ought to assume responsibility for all employment options for people with disabilities in order to move away from the suggestion that people with disabilities should be assisted by Health and Community Services  departments. The Committee has not supported this idea in full. Its evaluation of DEET programs has led to its concluding that, while the Department has established many useful programs, the value of these to people with disabilities, and particularly to people with severe disabilities, needs to be carefully assessed. The Committee acknowledges the development by DEET of a Disability Strategy and of special units such as Disability Access Support Units (DASUs), and believes that these may provide valuable support to people with disabilities. Nonetheless, it has concluded that the transfer of employment options from the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services to the Department of Employment, Education and Training would not be in the best interests of people with disabilities for some time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons for this is the difficulty faced by generic services in meeting the wide range of needs of people with disabilities. This has been a difficult issue for the Committee, but I believe it has been addressed through proper consideration being given to a wide range of factors that must necessarily impact upon access to services and the extent to which services can provide opportunities for people with disabilities. Because this area is one which has been the subject of division and debate for a number of years, it was essential for the Committee to stand back and look at many of the attitudes which have influenced those involved. These include service providers, consumers, parent groups, advocates, and government departments. Much evidence presented to the Committee argued passionately for and against a number of different service types, and discussed in detail the problems with service provision and differing philosophies and experiences.It was clear that the issue was of profound concern to a substantial number of people. It also became clear that, in many instances, there was little available information on a number of important issues and that this affected the extent to which people with disabilities had access to services, and to services which were appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In placing services within a broad context, the Committee considered the availability of data and of uniform terminology. It found that absence of comprehensive data, including data on school leavers ready to enter the workforce, was still a major problem. The Committee acknowledges the development within departments of new data collections, including those which will help assess the need for services. Nonetheless, the Committee is sufficiently concerned about data and definition problems to have made a number of recommendations in the first chapter about the need for improved data collection and the development of uniform definitions. This would help towards an assessment of unmet need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering the broad context of employment options, the Committee was also concerned to identify issues of access and equity which it believed were not sufficiently taken into consideration in the planning of services or in the evaluation of successful service operation. Consequently, the Committee has referred in the second chapter to a number of factors which it believes could seriously affect access. These factors include socio-economic background, gender, culture and race, geographic location and age. The Committee believes that it is essential for funding departments and service providers to be aware of such issues, particularly insofar as they may seriously affect the awareness of individuals or groups as to the need for, and the existence of, services. Consequently, the Committee has emphasised these matters, including the need for research on factors other than disability which may limit access to services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of access and of equity has also been examined. Much of the evidence received by the Committee spoke of the negative perceptions held by some people in the community about people with disabilities, of the need for changes to legislation, of the importance of education and information programs, in order to establish a legal base for change and to change community attitudes about the extent to which people with disabilities could contribute to society through work and other activities. The Committee supports the proposed Commonwealth anti-discrimination legislation and has made recommendations concerning types of discrimination which should be addressed and the need for affirmative action principles. Recommendations have also been made about continued information and education programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major concerns expressed by witnesses was the need to create a positive image for people with disabilities, and for employers and government departments to become more aware of the importance of positive attitudes and of taking into account the particular needs of people with disabilities. However, it also believes there is room for improvement, particularly in the public sector, which is often seen as failing to live up to its own message through providing new employment options for people with disabilities. Again, while acknowledging gradual improvements in the public sector as an employing body, the Committee notes that it is essential for bodies such as the Australian Public Service to set an example. While a diverse economic structure, multiskilling, workplace reform and rapid technological change may have meant a restructuring of industry which can lead to shrinking job opportunities, the same factors may also contribute to the creation of increased job opportunities for people with severe disabilities as well as for those with mild to moderate disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many witnesses argued that access to education was crucial to later effective access to meaningful employment, and regarded access to mainstream school education as the best option for many children with disabilities. The Committee was particularly concerned to examine the transition from school to the workforce since this was identified as a major factor in determining an individual's success in obtaining satisfactory employment and in retaining skills. Again, the issue of data was raised, and it appeared that no adequate statistics were available Australia-wide on the numbers and needs of those who left school each year and how far such needs could be met. While it is obvious that a number of factors will affect access to appropriate education and to transition services, the Committee believes that such services are crucial and that governments and other education authorities must give top priority to identifying needs, providing work experience, setting up effective transition services, and establishing referral and counselling services which ensure that students do not miss out on employment opportunities and access to other community activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Committee has placed particular emphasis on the importance of equity in access to school education and to transition programs, it also believes that tertiary education has a major role to play. Both TAFE and universities provide opportunities for people with disabilities, but in many cases the lack of adequate resources, and difficulties of access, meant that individuals with the ability to take advantage of opportunities were more frustrated than assisted. The Committee has made recommendations, including a recommendation on annual reporting by tertiary institutions, on access of people with disabilities to education services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes that its examination of a range of access factors has provided a solid basis for its evaluation of current and future employment options. Its objective was to see how these options operated, whose needs they met, how they could be improved, and whether they addressed the concerns voiced by many witnesses. Such concerns emphasised, in particular, the fact that too often 'employment' was seen as a full-time occupation for people who, while initially requiring assistance in accessing employment and in learning additional skills, would nonetheless demonstrate consistent skill maintenance or improvement. Yet, as a number of submissions pointed out, consistent upward progression and increasing development of skills was not possible for all people with disabilities, nor was full-time employment. The effects of different disabilities were therefore considered in order to determine the range of needs and the types of services which might be needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has emphasised that standard full-time employment options cannot be utilised by a number of individuals; and, while it acknowledges that some options are available which can meet the demand for part-time work or job-sharing, believes that a priority should be to develop further employment options.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the Committee has considered the need for more flexible concepts of employment to be developed which would include work, study, recreation, etc. Such options may be of considerable benefit to the community. For people whose skills may decrease rather than increase, and for those with fluctuating work patterns, unpredictable behaviour, and some psychiatric disabilities, such flexible options may well be the only suitable and satisfying type of employment likely to allow their meaningful participation in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To a degree, some existing work options may be able to offer such flexibility, and the special Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service units for people with psychiatric disabilities are a welcome move towards assisting a group of people with disabilities who have had limited access. Nonetheless, the Committee's consideration of new employment options (such as Competitive Employment Training and Placement&mdash;CETP&mdash;services and Supported Employment services) has led it to conclude that there is still room for these services to meet the needs of those more difficult to place. The Committee wishes to acknowledge that these options have provided varied work and employment opportunities, to people with mild, and moderate to severe disabilities, including intellectual disabilities. Nonetheless, the Committee also believes that these services have not been sufficiently evaluated to identify why some individuals benefit greatly from them, and others do not, or why access is easy for some and not for others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, the Committee is concerned that equity in access may not be available, and that the pressures placed on services to demonstrate success may have led to the 'easier' clients (including those with a supportive family) obtaining services more readily than the more difficult, or alienated clients. This was suggested by a number of witnesses, including those who operated such services and those who operated sheltered workshops. If this situation has occurred, it is imperative that the funding Department (Department of Health, Housing and Community Services) assess its own expectations and the pressures it may have placed on organisations, and determine if genuine equality of opportunity is being provided to people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further major concern which the Committee has in respect of `new' employment services relates to the funding arrangements and the evaluation of services. One of the reasons for the setting up of this inquiry was to examine the ways in which new services differed from traditional sheltered workshops and how they provided opportunities to people who were considered to be less well served by established service types. In assessing evaluation and accountability processes, the Committee was concerned that inadequate funding appeared to have been provided for training and development of service providers, and that the Department itself had little information on the new services, with little accountability apparently being required. The Committee's consideration of sheltered workshops has identified a number of management problems which had become entrenched (as well as discriminatory practices which devalued clients). The Department was obviously well aware of poor management practices, limited accountability, and inability of workshops to meet the objectives of the Handicapped Persons' Assistance Act 1974 (replaced by the Disability Services Act 1986), and should have made every effort not to reproduce these problems in new services. The Committee believes that regular evaluation of, and reporting on, all services is required, that adequate funding be provided for training, that accountability processes be instituted, so that problems can be identified quickly and addressed with expert assistance. While in agreement with the general direction of new service types, the Committee believes that the goal of flexibility is best achieved through establishing firm parameters for services to work within.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering current and future employment options, the Committee undertook an evaluation of sheltered workshops, supplemented by visits to workshops in a number of States and discussions with service providers. The Committee has heard evidence from a number of organisations and individuals on the disadvantages of sheltered workshops and of the effect of certain attitudes and practices on people with disabilities. The Committee is unanimous in its support of service users having access to improved employment opportunities, better conditions, appropriate wages, dignity and respect. However, the Committee has also pointed out that funding limitations, poor management practices and lack of strict accountability procedures, have been among the causal factors of the unsatisfactory state of a number of workshops and of the failure to meet stated objectives. A number of parties have contributed to this situation, and must take responsibility for doing so. The Committee makes this point, not to contribute to the often bitter controversy about workshops, about the funding disparities between old and new services, about the expense of new services and the exclusion of many people from access to them, but to determine the reasons for poor performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so doing, the Committee has considered the possible role of improved workshops in providing employment options, and is of the opinion that such workshops may have a role in providing training and employment opportunities in the future, particularly for people with severe disabilities and those people whose work patterns are variable and/or those whose skills may not increase or will decrease. This suggests that existing facilities could continue to have a role in providing employment options, although clearly adequate funding, staffing, training and expert managerial advice would be essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reaching this conclusion, the Committee wishes to emphasise that it has recommended similar monitoring and evaluation processes for all service types currently offered by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, and that while it believes the problems of the workshops prior to transition have been demonstrated, the potential or real problem of new service types must also be clearly identified and solved if access is to be improved across the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Committee began its inquiry, a number of changes have occurred in service provision, in the development of evaluation, in the workshop transition process, and transition time-frame, and many of these changes are supported by the Committee's findings. In particular, the Committee believes that the extension of the transition period and the establishment of the National Technical Assistance Unit have been major achievements, not least in that they are a recognition of the effect of past neglect, and of the capacity of services to provide real, meaningful options to people with disabilities. It is this, in conjunction with more thorough assessment of new services, and more effective labour-market training and work experience programs, which will provide a good foundation for the continued development of acceptable employment options.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has also considered related issues, such as skills-based wages, job-sharing, the costs associated with disability, the need for increased and appropriate support (such as transport, personal care, affordable aids and equipment and special leave). It has made a number of recommendations in these areas because of the importance which it places on increasing access to employment for people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, the Committee believes that considerable changes have occurred over the past ten years. It also believes, however, that much still needs to be done to create and maintain a range of viable work options for people with disabilities, so that they have greater opportunity to participate more fully in society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee wishes to thank those individuals and organisations who made submissions, gave oral evidence to the Committee, and welcomed the Committee to their services. It also wishes to thank those Departments, especially the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services; the Department of Employment, Education and Training; the Department of Industrial Relations; and the Department of Social Security, which provided advice and assistance throughout the inquiry. The Committee also thanks past and present members of the Secretariat of the Committee who have worked on this inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all, the Committee would like to acknowledge the efforts of the individuals and organisations who have worked for so long to change public perception and understanding of people with disabilities and who have helped to move the debate from the individual to the broader community. As Disabled Peoples' International told us, 'Disability has too long been viewed as a problem of the individual and not the relationship for that individual and his/her environment.' Employment is, for most people, an important part of that environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian society must recognise that the community deprives itself of the talents and skills of hundreds of thousands of people as long as it fails to provide a range of appropriate employment options for Australians with disabilities, as well as denying those people the right to fuller participation in the community.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have just tabled the Committee's report entitled `ASIO and the Archives Act', which is the first report to be presented to the Parliament by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organization. The report addresses the question referred to the Committee of how the activities of ASIO are affected by the operation of the Archives Act 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Archives Act first came into operation in 1983 and provides a right of public access to records of the Commonwealth that are more than 30 years old: the 30-year rule. This is subject to the right of the government to withhold records on defence and security and a number of other grounds. Decisions to withhold material are appealable to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The government can reinforce its claim for exemption by applying a `Conclusive Certificate' to the record.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the seven years of the operation of the Act more than 1,600 ASIO files have been wholly or partially released for public access under the provisions of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ASIO and the other agencies in the intelligence communities have consistently opposed the application of the 30-year rule to their records. They were supported in this position by the Royal Commissioner, Mr Justice Hope, in 1985, who recommended in his Report into Australia's Intelligence Security Agencies (RCAISA) that ASIO's operational files be excluded from the cover of the Archives Act and released only at the discretion of the Director-General of Security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government did not accept the RCASIA recommendation and in tabling the RCASIA report in May 1985, the then Prime Minister, the Hon. R J L Hawke, AC, MP, stated the view of the Government that the provisions of the Archives Act were already adequate to protect the legitimate concerns of the intelligence community, which should continue to be subject to the 30-year rule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has continued to be a difference of opinion between the intelligence community and the government on this matter of release of records. In each of its annual reports since 1984 ASIO has continued to seek a review of the decision that it should be bound by the 30 year rule. It was in these circumstances that the Committee was asked to undertake the present review which has been effectively under way since May 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that this Report is not a general review of the operation of the Archives Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ASIO submitted that the 30-year rule was too short and that its records and those of the other Intelligence Agencies should be embargoed for 50 years. It submitted that a decision to withhold a record from release on security grounds should not be reviewable on appeal to the AAT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Committee shares the concern of ASIO about certain classes of records, it does not accept the argument that the entire ASIO archive should be closed for 50 years. The Committee's general finding is that ASIO records should continue to be subject to the access provisions of the Archives Act and the open access period in respect of ASIO records should continue to be 30 years from the creation of the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of ASIO's specific concerns relates to intelligence information supplied by Australia's defence and intelligence partners. The Committee was told and accepts that these allies supply or exchange intelligence information which is of crucial importance to Australia's defence and security and that they might terminate or reduce the level and quality of their cooperation unless completely satisfied with the level of protection provided in Australia. The Committee was told that Australia's comparatively liberal document access was a cause of concern to allies and could result in a reduction or down-grading of cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure the continued flow of high quality intelligence material the Committee recommends that it should be embargoed as long as it remains under embargo in the nation supplying it (Recommendation 1). It reinforces Recommendation 1 by proposing that once the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (IGIS) has certified the foreign derived provenance of a record there should be no further appeal to the AAT from a decision not to release it (Recommendation 2).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another specific area of concern is the need to protect agents sources, targets and methods of operation of the Organization. It is difficult to see how an intelligence agency can function if it were not able to give guaranteed anonymity to its operatives. The Committee recommends that the identity of sources, agents and operatives should be guaranteed in guidelines for a period of 30 years from the persons death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Committee did not accept an argument of ASIO that it should be able to claim an exemption on behalf of individuals mentioned in ASIO records, on broad grounds of privacy, unrelated to security. The Committee was satisfied that privacy rights of individuals were adequately protected under the general provisions of the Archives Act as administered by Australian Archives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nor did the Committee accept the submission of ASIO that the right of appeal to the AAT from a refusal to release ASIO records should be abolished. ASIO had proposed that an appeal to the IGIS should be substituted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee makes three Recommendations regarding the appeal process. The Archives Act provides a two-tiered system of review. A person refused access can, first, apply for an internal reconsideration. This is currently determined by the Director-General of Archives on the advice of ASIO. If still dissatisfied the applicant can appeal to the AAT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommends that the Director-General of Security, not the Director-General of Archives, should determine applications for internal review which involve national security records. We have concluded that there should be a further right of appeal from the Director-General of Security through the IGIS to the Attorney-General. An appeal to the AAT should lie from the decision of the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For their part the clients of the Archives wishing to access ASIO records have expressed deep frustration both as to the failure of ASIO to comply with requests for access within the statutory period of 90 days and to a perceived failure of the Organization to be cooperative in its dealing with its client group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This evidence was strongly in favour of ASIO remaining subject to the 30-year rule and highly critical of the manner in which ASIO has responded to its legal obligation to provide access to its records. ASIO has been compared unfavourably with other Commonwealth agencies with whom these scholars deal for access to defence and security records. A problem here is that there is no identifiable person at ASIO with whom scholars can meet to negotiate complicated requests for information. Other Commonwealth agencies such as the departments of Defence and Foreign Affairs and Trade employ a designated official qualified to negotiate for the department and assist clients to formulate their requests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ASIO does not provide scholars with finding aids and indices as these departments do, with the result that scholars are forced to trawl by making omnibus requests in the hope of turning up the information that they want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ASIO releases records only after they have undergone a painstaking and labour intensive scrutiny by "clearers" who are Senior Intelligence Officers on a routine posting. The records released as a result of this process frequently disappoint the expectations of the clients who complain that they have been culled to such an extent that the only material released is documents already in the public domain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has, however, been satisfied that the process of clearing is justified on grounds of national security. The AAT in its decisions has endorsed the internal processes applied by ASIO and decisions made by ASIO to withhold material on national security grounds. It is unlikely, therefore that, as result of this report applicants will receive more material than they are getting now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite these constraints the Committee believes that there is room for improvement in the way ASIO handles access requests. First, the Government must appropriate sufficient resources to enable ASIO to discharge its statutory obligations. There is a need for a change in ethos on the part of ASIO to a more cooperative approach. We recommend that an archival unit within ASIO be established to consult and negotiate with researchers, particularly those with large requests. Less complicated requests should be fast-tracked. The unit needed to be accessible to the public and this means that it needs to be headed by a person who can be known to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will require a change to the ASIO Act which currently requires the anonymity of all ASIO personnel other than the Director-General of Security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unit should also develop indices and finding aids that can be made available to the public without infringing national security and can also devote some resources to preparing records, in advance, for release as they fall into the open access period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Mr President, there have been expressions of concern that individuals have no right of access to records of ASIO to ensure that information about them on ASIO files is accurate. In certain cases, the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act provide such rights in relation to the current records, but not to ASIO as that legislation does not apply to the intelligence agencies. Such agencies routinely refuse to confirm or deny whether they have individuals under surveillance or hold records on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee acknowledges that this is the only possible stance for an intelligence agency to adopt. However, in Recommendation 14 we suggest a means whereby a person may bring information to the attention of the IGIS  which he would then be required to bring to the attention of any intelligence agency to whom it might be relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, the Committee believes the adoption of these proposals will ensure that the security interests of the Commonwealth continue to receive proper protection, at the same time ensuring that important national records are preserved for posterity, while providing at the same time as wide a right of public access to those records commensurate with the requirements of national security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Mr President, I would like to place on record my thanks to my colleagues on the Committee and to those who contributed to the inquiry for the time and effort they have put in.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Reynolds</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing in response to your Committee's interim report on telephone services, dated 12 December 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government shares the concern of the Committee that there should be appropriate standards for the content of messages on the 0055 and 0051 networks provided by the Australian and overseas Telecommunications Corporation (AOTC) and that there should be appropriate enforcement of those standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I enclose for your information a copy of AOTC's response dated 23 March 1992 to the recommendations of your Committee's report. While there are some differences in regard to details, there appears to be broad agreement by AOTC to the thrust of the Committee's report, namely that there should be strict enforcement of appropriate standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his letter to AOTC (then Telecom) dated 17 September 1991, the then Minister, Mr Beazley, expressed his support for the initiatives taken by the industry and the Government's preferred approach continues to be that there should be self-regulation by the industry on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time, the government reiterates its position that "adult" services not be available on the open access 0055 service but either be withdrawn or, if appropriate, migrated to the closed user access 0051 service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AOTC has advised me that, since the time of the tabling of the Committee's report, the industry has acted to modify or withdraw messages which do not meet content standards. In addition, some service providers have connected messages to the 0051 service. I have also been advised that the number of complaints about unsuitable 0055 messages has declined from 138 in January 1992 to 13 in February 1992, which may reflect the fact that arrangements put in place by the industry are now taking affect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, the Government will continue to monitor the industry closely and if there is evidence that the system of self-regulation is not working, the Government will take appropriate action to ensure that legitimate community concerns are addressed.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AOTC'S RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS CONTAINED IN THE INTERIM REPORT OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY STANDARDS RELEVANT TO THE SUPPLY OF SERVICES UTILISING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AOTC appreciates the work of the Committee to this stage and is generally supportive of the recommendations contained in the Interim Report relating to 0055 services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before providing specific responses to the Recommendations in the Report, we would like to take the opportunity to comment on the following matters raised in the Committee's Report and the Chairperson's tabling statement in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.At paragraph 4.14 of the report, the Committee "commends the Minister for his intervention and condemns Telecom for its obvious lack of concern for principles of accountability to Parliament".</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Minister's letter to Telecom of 17 September 1991 regarding "adult" services was not a formal direction, Telecom took positive steps to implement the Minister's wishes. Until we are in a position to implement the Committee's recommendations concerning new standards, AOTC has had no alternative but to follow the procedures developed in the new Codes of Practice.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telecom's interpretation of the Minister's letter was that "adult" messages are those which did not conform to the new code of Practice and these should be modified, withdrawn or migrated to the 0051 service.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">AOTC, therefore, does not understand the Committee's conclusion that Telecom's actions showed a "lack of concern for principles of accountability to Parliament".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.In the tabling statement, the Chairperson states that "the Committee has rejected Telecom's approach to the problem (control of message content) essentially because it is clearly not working".</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Codes of Practice formulated by the Telephone Information Service Standards Committee (TISSC) were introduced on 1 October 1991. AOTC's view is that any new mechanism for control of message content and advertising needs time to indicate positive results. It is of note that action taken by Telecom since October as well as action initiated by Service Providers has resulted in a large reduction in the number of advertisements for adult services in the media. Also, 1075 public complaints (independent of Telecom actions) have been handled by the Telephone Information Services Arbitrator to the end of January 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.A further point in the tabling statement is critical of Telecom "for its failure to fully respond to the Committee's operations and for having proceeded with certain areas of policy measures, which clearly fall within the Committee's terms of reference, while the Committee's inquiry has still been in progress".</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">AOTC is disappointed at this criticism as Telecom's intentions in regard to the Codes of Practice for 0055 and 0051 were made clear in our original submission and in subsequent discussions, for example, Hansard pages 61 and 62.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, at the last hearing on 7 November 1991, Telecom put the view, and understood that the Chairperson agreed with it, that our actions had not been pre-emptive. This was on the basis that revised contracts incorporating the new Codes of Practice had not been signed. However, Service Providers have formally agreed to abide by the Codes of Practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AOTC's comments on the recommendations are set out below. We reserve the right to reconsider our views, however, in the light of the Committee's final report and of any further debate on these matters by the Senate as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1: That Telecom adopt as the code of conduct for its message standard for the 0055 open access service the following:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)The Service Provider will not provide knowingly or negligently on any 0055 number allocated to it, information which in any way may be interpreted as indecent, obscene, offensive or sexually titillating or denoting sexual suggestion or sexual fantasy; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)The Service Provider will not provide knowingly or negligently on any 0055 number allocated to it, messages whether described as medical or otherwise which contain material that a reasonable parent would not wish his or her child to hear without parental guidance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AOTC can accept in principle this recommendation which contains the wording from the Message Standards section of the previous 0055 Operational Requirements. However, there is a concern that the sweeping nature of the provision, and, in particular, the words "in any way" in part (a) would set a standard of such a low threshold that any person's judgement would be determinative. It will be recalled that it was this broad sweep which in many instances made this requirement unrealistic for Telecom to enforce when it was part of the earlier standards. AOTC suggests that any words "in any way" should be deleted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AOTC's experience has been that there is a strong community demand for medical messages. On our reading, the Committee's recommendation leaves it open for suitably authorised and appropriately structured medical messages to continue to be available on the 0055 service. However a message that would otherwise be acceptable under part (a) may fail under the "reasonable parent" test in part (b) of the recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AOTC suggests that the Committee should give further consideration to the genuine community need for such messages on the one hand and the concern of parents relating to access by children on the other.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst not specifically covered in this recommendation, it is noted from the tabling statement in Parliament on 12 December 1991 that the Committee proposes adoption of advertising and other standards from Telecom's previous Operational Requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Committee's view is that advertising and other standards should parallel the message content standards, an explicit reference should be included in the recommendation to avoid any confusion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2: That Telecom ensure that all services currently provided on 0055 which are in breach of the message standard as listed in Recommendation 1 are either migrated immediately to the 0051 closed user access service or are withdrawn outright.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AOTC agrees in principle with this recommendation. Obviously if a message does not comply with the standards in Recommendation No. 1 once they are incorporated into contracts with Service Providers, it will not continue to be connected to 0055.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are three matters requiring attention in implementation of this recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1.The new standards will need to be incorporated in revised contracts between Service Providers and Telecom (see Recommendation No. 4)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">2.A mechanism is to be established for messages to be judged as complying with the standards (see Recommendation No. 5)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">3.The options for Service Providers should include withdrawal of a message and re-connection following suitable modification to a message.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3: That Telecom adopt as the code of conduct for its message standard for the 0051 closed user access service the following:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Service Provider will not provide knowingly or negligently on any 0051 number allocated to it, information which in any way may be interpreted as equivalent to the R or X film/video classification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AOTC accepts this recommendation in principle and, consistent with our response to Recommendation No. 1(a), suggests that the words "in any way" be deleted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendation would therefore read ". . . . . . . . . information which may be interpreted as equivalent. . . . . . . . . ".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The linking of audio and visual classifications could cause difficulties in interpretation but no doubt the work could be undertaken on a good faith basis by a qualified agency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4: That Telecom discontinue its contractual agreements with Service Providers and offer new contractual agreements which observe the recommended code of conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AOTC agrees to this recommendation and will endeavour to have new contracts in place at an early date. To this end, Telecom has been discussing with the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) the proposed role for the OFLC and new standards for message content. The OFLC is preparing draft standards, based on the Committee's recommendations and discussions, to replace the relevant parts of the current Codes of Practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AOTC has also been discussing the question of new contracts with Service Providers, the Telephone Information Services Standards Committee (TISSC) and the Telephone Information Service Arbitrator (TISA). In particular the contracts will need to cover consumer protection issues which are not within the province of the OFLC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It might be noted that Service Providers have not agreed to adopt the Committee's recommended standards and have challenged AOTC's legal right to vary the contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 5: That Telecom enter into a contract with the Office of Film and Literature Classification for it to act as the monitoring and enforcement body for the code of conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation is acceptable in principle to AOTC and the OFLC has been contacted (see response to Recommendation No. 4). The cost of the new arrangements will be a factor in the contract negotiations with the OFLC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AOTC's view is that there will still be significant roles for TISSC and TISA in areas other than message content and advertising standards, for example, consumer protection issues (see also response to Recommendation No. 4).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 6: That Telecom undertake to introduce an immediate program of random monitoring to ensure contractual compliance of message content on both 0055 and 0051 with the code of conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AOTC agrees in principle with this recommendation and will make continuing arrangements for random monitoring of 0055 services. This must be co-ordinated with the similar OFLC activities requested by the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 7: That the code of conduct provide that any message content breach will lead to service disconnection on the first occasion and contract cancellation on any subsequent occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AOTC agrees that there need to be appropriate sanctions for breaches of standards. We also agree that discontinuation of a message may well be appropriate in certain circumstances. However, AOTC cannot agree with the recommendation as worded, for the following reasons:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)Cancellation of a Service Provider's total contract for a subsequent breach is considered to be too general a prescription and could be construed as unfair and unreasonable because of the automatic application proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)Most Service Providers are involved in a wide range of messages. Cancellation of the entire contract for two offending messages would be a harsh penalty. Cancellation of a contract would penalise users of other messages provided by the same Service Provider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c)Breaches of the code of conduct can range from relatively harmless to very serious and the proposed penalty in the recommendation does not adequately reflect the range of breaches. This is another aspect of the unfairness and unreasonableness of the recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d)Situations arise where the breach is not the fault of the Service Provider. Penalties should have regard to fault if they are to facilitate appropriate conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taking the above into account, AOTC would prefer the recommendation to be framed to provide that contracts with Service Providers should require immediate discontinuation of a message when it is determined to be in breach of the standards in Recommendation No. 1. There should be a range of penalties for various types of breaches as is currently described in the Codes of Practice and, in addition, there should be provision for contract cancellation for flagrant, significant or continuing breaches of the message content standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 8: That the Service Providers be required to provide basic consumer information on the duration and cost of each message at the beginning of each recorded message; the cost of doing this to be borne by the Service Provider.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AOTC agrees in principle with this recommendation but, as noted by the Committee in paragraph 4.77 of its Interim Report, implementation is not practicable in the short term.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Major development work would be necessary to effect changes to current billing arrangements. The need to exempt 0055 calls which record a vote in polls or enter miscellaneous competitions adds to the complexity of the problem. Obviously, this recommendation will require a detailed technical investigation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly about a matter of considerable importance to the Senate because on one view it could constitute an abuse of the process of Senate committee hearings. It concerns statements made by the Australian Workers Union that it has only recently become aware of commercial links between certain farming organisations and certain insurance companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March this year, in a submission to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, the Australian Workers Union claimed that until recently it had been unaware of commercial links between employer associations and insurance companies. Its concerns particularly relate to the circumstances in which the pastoral award provides for two insurance companies to be the sponsors of superannuation funds, the fact that those insurance companies conduct a wide range of insurance business and that commissions paid by those companies to agents and others are the subject of commercial links with certain farming organisations. It is not suggested by anyone, as I understand it, that there are any commissions payable on the sale of superannuation business. Nor is it suggested by the AWU that there is anything improper in these arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AWU has said to the Senate Committee that it was simply not aware of these commercial links. In a letter dated 19 March, the Secretary of the union, Michael Forshaw, wrote to the Managing Director of the Australian Eagle Insurance Company Ltd, complaining in very strong terms about some comments in a letter in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> written by the Managing Director, Mr Lester. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The General Secretary of the AWU said that information regarding payments to insurance companies and the commercial relationship with these bodies:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . was never revealed to the Industrial Relations Commission at the time the Pastoral Industry Superannuation Award was first made. It was certainly never made known to the AWU even though we are a party to the Industrial Award which provides for superannuation contributions to be paid into the fund managed by your company. Rather this information only came to our knowledge some time after the Award was made. In my view, this was relevant and material information that should have been disclosed at the time.</PARA>
<PARA>These outbursts of indignation about total ignorance relating to commercial links found their way into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and subsequently were the subject of discussion on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Country Hour</EMPHASIS> on Radio National. As one would imagine, that program achieves quite wide currency in the farming community. Therefore, Radio National became a vehicle for the retailing of these concerns. Indeed, the presenter commenced the program by pointing out that the union, in giving evidence to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, had said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the National Farmers Federation and some state farmer organisations failed to reveal commercial links with insurance funds handling superannuation payments.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Nick Sherry, the Chairman of the Select Committee, was also interviewed on the program. I say in passing that Senator Sherry is doing an excellent job as Chairman of that Committee, but unfortunately he, too, appears to have been misled on the basis of this information. It had been argued that the commercial relationship should have been disclosed and he expressed some concerns about this. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The allegation made to us was that there is a commercial relationship . . . and that should have been disclosed at the time the superannuation fund was set up. . . I think it's an important issue that superannuation funds, if it is claimed that they're independent, are in fact totally independent and there is no commercial relationship.</PARA>
<PARA>The question of independence relates purely to the question of the status of the trustees of the funds and that matter has been made clear from the outset.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Farmers Federation has engaged in heated disputation with the AWU about whether there should be worker representatives on the boards of trustees. The NFF's position is that it is much more appropriate to have people with commercial expertise, but as a fall back position they would contemplate employer and employee representatives on the board. But it does not believe that it is appropriate to have union representatives on the board because the level of unionisation in the pastoral industry is very low. I will come in a moment to the consequences of even having superannuation provisions apply in the pastoral industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that on the basis of those sorts of allegations, clearly an attempt is being made by the Australian Workers Union to suggest that somehow these commercial links have only recently surfaced and that that is a matter of great concern. It is significant that at present Commissioner Merriman has reserved his decision on a review he has conducted about superannuation arrangements in the pastoral industry. That decision is expected to be handed down shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raises concern that the AWU has sought to raise these allegations at this time under parliamentary privilege through the Senate Committee and that these allegations have found their way into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and on Radio National. The facts reveal that this is simply not the case. I wish to take the Senate to the transcript of evidence relating to the original application when the matter was before the Industrial Relations Commission and the provisions of the pastoral award were being determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far from these commercial links not having been made known to the Commission, I would point out that Mr Costello, who appeared for the employer respondents, indicated at the outset that he proposed to call evidence in relation to the Australian farm superannuation fund, a fund sponsored inter alia by the Victorian Farmers Federation in conjunction with Australian Eagle. Evidence was given by a Mr Towers, a principal witness. When asked what was the Victorian farmers insurance agency, Mr Towers's evidence was that it was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a linkup between Australian Eagle and the Victorian Farmers Federation which provides general insurance assistance to Victorian farmers. So it is a network throughout the State'.</PARA>
<PARA>Most importantly, he was asked what source of money the agency derived to pay its people. The answer was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They would be on the commission they had received for the policies they had sold'.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Mr Towers was making it perfectly plain that commissions were payable on general insurance and that that was a matter that was on the table from the outset. It is therefore extraordinary not only that the AWU should pretend that somehow it was never aware of these commercial links, but also that it should seek to raise the matter at this time. I think one is entitled to draw the conclusion that this is a fairly grubby attempt to try to influence the Industrial Relations Commission at the eleventh hour, after all the evidence is in but while the umpire is still presumably making up his mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the Government and the ACTU have no respect at all for the notion of an independent IRC. We have only to look at the howls of outrage which followed the 1991 national wage case when the Commission had the temerity to suggest that award superannuation was simply not working. Since that time the Commission has been subjected to unprecedented and outrageous bully boy tactics by the likes of Cabinet Ministers Cook and Kelty&mdash;a campaign of abuse, intimidation and vilification that would make Mike Tyson blush and which was clearly designed to influence the IRC or, failing that, to cut it off at the knees. That is why Mr Kelty is so determined that it should not even retain the nexus of pay with Federal Court judges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact remains that these allegations by the AWU are simply not true. I think the real explanation is this: Mr Forshaw, who was the General Secretary at the time and who was obviously aware of the commercial links, simply did not do his homework. In other words, he did not research the matter. He could easily have looked at the annual reports of the Victorian Farmers Federation and other State organisations, discovered the true nature and extent of those commercial links, the amounts of moneys that were being paid by way of commission, and then, if necessary, have made a further submission to the IRC or, indeed, have amplified concerns expressed at the time. But he did not do any of that. In other words, he was too lazy. He simply proceeded on the basis of the evidence and then discovered matters later on of which he was clearly capable of having knowledge earlier. Then to disguise his own incompetence and ineptitude he has resorted to this sort of blustering tactic, presumably to persuade his own membership that this is a matter of current concern when in fact, if it was ever a matter of concern, it was a matter that should have been known to him and should have been raised at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think in the circumstances it is incumbent on Mr Forshaw to make a full and frank explanation, which I would have thought would involve an apology for attempting to mislead the Senate Committee, and certainly to withdraw any inference that this is designed to influence the Commission in its deliberations. I would be very interested to hear Mr Forshaw's explanation for his going over the top in the way that he did. I can understand that because he did not do his homework he might not have been aware of the full nature and extent of these commercial arrangements, but the fact remains that they were fully disclosed at the time. He could have known more about them if he had chosen to inquire further, but he simply did not. That is in no way a sufficient justification for taking up the time of the Senate Committee in the way that he has and attempting to mislead the Senate Committee and others by suggesting that he was not aware of these commercial links. </PARA>

It shows a disrespect for the importance of this matter to Aboriginal people. However, when it does fit within their agendas no time or energy is spared.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To return to the ministerial statement, I am relieved to hear that it is proposed that this matter will be given due time at the next sitting.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude with an urgent plea to all honourable senators. I request that any honourable senator who has not actually read one of the 99 individual case studies of the deaths reported by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody should choose one from within their own State. This will allow the full and serious impact of this Royal Commission to be considered prior to the discussion of the ministerial statement at the next Senate sitting. I am increasingly realising the pressure of time under which all parliamentarians work and if it is not possible to read one case study, I urge senators at least to read the report I tabled on 31 March 1992. It is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Royal Commissions and Omissions</EMPHASIS> and a copy is available on request from my office.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few remarks about what I think is a very sad day for Australia when we see the Government taking action to ban the right to trade in products that are legal. For me, the right to trade in products that are legal includes the right to advertise, the right to sponsor and the right to promote that legal product. I refer to the Government's decision to ban sponsorship of sporting events and, indeed, cultural events and any other events concerning the tobacco industry and smoking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say right at the outset that I gave up smoking about 16 years ago and I did it for reasons that made sense to me. However, I will defend the right of anyone who wishes to smoke to do so and I will defend the right of the companies to promote their products through the ordinary outlets that are available, be they be billboards, sponsorship, television, or radio. With the so-called death of socialism, we find in our community a small but growing band of people who want to impose their values on everybody else&mdash;the regulators; the people who want to tell you what is good for you and what is not good for you, what you may have what you may not have, when you may have it and when you may not have it. They may think they have had a win today with the banning of the sponsorship of tobacco products. What will be next, the alcohol industry? Then they will move on to the confectionery industry and the manufacturers of armchairs. Perhaps they will move on to the day-to-day right that we have to choose between a wool product and a synthetic product. The world is full of people who want to tell us how we ought to spend our dollars, how we ought to make judgments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is most important that we determine that we have civil liberties in our country, and that we have the right to deal with products that are legal. Why do those people who want to see tobacco products banned not have the courage to come out and fight that issue?  A survey of the newspapers the other day showed that 70 per cent of ordinary Australian citizens believe that companies ought to have the right to sponsor sporting events, cultural events or any other activity that they wish to sponsor. Seventy per cent of Australian opinion is just to be knocked out by the people who are determined to regulate the way in which everybody lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an important issue. As I have already said, I chose for myself what I wanted to do with regard to cigarettes, and it is the right of every other Australian to make his or her own judgment. And it is the right of those people who are opposed or who think that there is an adverse effect on health to raise their own money and, if they want to do so, to put a program to air advocating that people give it up. Competition of ideas in the media is what I am talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose I should not be surprised that this is a Government that wants to ban things. After all, we have been denied the right of freedom of speech with regard to political advertising. Such advertising has been banned for the most cynical of reasons. So why should I be surprised that the Government would go ahead and ban the rights of people to deal with products that are legal.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is indeed a sad day for Australia because it could be said that it is the thin edge of the wedge; it will be used as a precedent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a concerted campaign to make tobacco and alcohol somehow synonymous with the illegal and illicit drugs that kill or ruin the lives of young people. There has been a concerted campaign to try to say that tobacco and alcohol are just as bad as heroin or cocaine or marijuana or amphetamines. Well, it is wrong. Our society has made a judgment. We have adjudged that alcohol and tobacco are legal products within our community and that the others are not. We have adjudged that we can find ways of dealing with those products in our society which allow a legal product to be dealt with in the way I have earlier described in terms of advertising and sales. But here we have the thin edge of the wedge, which is a threat to every other manufacturer, seller, retailer of products which some group will determine are really not in the best interests of citizens. </PARA>

My colleague Senator Baume was just talking about disabled sportsmen who have made a judgment for themselves that they will not be disbarred from taking part in any aspect of life they choose. Ordinarily, one might say that because of their impairment they are unable to participate in competitive sport. Well, they have decided for themselves that their own will will entitle them to do it, and more courage to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not need a group of do-gooders, a group of thought police or a group of regulators to tell the Australian people when they may exercise their democratic rights and when they may not. The day that those people who want to see tobacco products banned have the courage to come out and fight on their true intention, then that is the day we can debate that issue. But simply to say that by regulation we will try to force them out of business is a very dangerous precedent to set indeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw attention to an answer that was given to me in Question Time by the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook. In doing so I want to highlight a tactic that is being adopted by a number of Government Ministers&mdash;and Senator Lewis highlighted this today&mdash;who begin answers to questions by saying or inferring that one has the question wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This tactic will get the Government into all sorts of trouble because we will come back&mdash;in particular, I will come back&mdash;and point out where the Government is wrong. Senator Cook, in his comments today, was wrong, not only in the substance of what he said&mdash;he has misled the Senate, as I contended in my question today&mdash;but also in his assertion that I have got it wrong. I want to explain why he is wrong. He cast aspersions on the accuracy of my question. My question yesterday was very carefully worded. The words were ` to force contractors to operate within the award system'. I underline that word `force'. I turn to the press release the Minister put out yesterday. I intend to explain why I assert that the word `force' is correct. I will quote two paragraphs of that press release which relate to this matter and to the Minister's emphatic answer,` No' to my question yesterday. His press release states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Industrial Relations Commission will have regard to relevant customs and practice in a dispute over independent contractors and ensure that their use is not harsh or unfair.</PARA>
<PARA>He says `dispute'. This will affect every contractor in this country, because all anybody has to do where contractors are operating is to bring on a dispute. That can be brought on in a number of ways: by withdrawing labour and going on strike, or by lodging an application with the Industrial Relations Commission stating that there is a particular problem. That could be done to any contractor in any situation in any workplace in Australia. The Minister then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission can also determine whether the total remuneration of contractors will be less than that of employees and whether there is any intention to avoid obligations under awards. </PARA>
<PARA>For Senator Cook yesterday, and also again today, to state that this would not have an impact on all contractors is truly false. It is false for the very reason I gave regarding the last paragraph I quoted, in that a dispute can be brought on. These contractors have made their own arrangements with their employees, whether they be part of a contract team, or whether the contractor is contracted out to an owner or employer to carry out certain tasks in a certain area, which for example could be the building industry. The cottage building industry has expressed the most concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is blatantly wrong and totally false to suggest that the implications of this legislation as presented in this press release will not affect contractors in the building industry or, for that matter, contractors in any other industry. Once a dispute is brought before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission pressure will be put on those contractors to comply in terms of the various existing awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next thing I want to refer to regarding the answer that was given to me today is the use of term, `sham contractors'. The use of the term, `sham contractors' is aimed absolutely and blatantly at none other than Troubleshooters&mdash;except that the Minister has not said Troubleshooters. It is aimed at the concept that Troubleshooters have introduced in recent years into the Australian contract system. I particularly want to refer to the last part of Senator Cook's answer to me today, where he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in other areas, customs and practices may well be different. On a multi-storey construction site in the middle of the central business district of a capital city, custom and practice would be award coverage, and, should people wish then to try and break that down by introducing sham contracts, the Commission would have regard to that award area of award coverage and award against the so-called independent contractors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to point out Troubleshooters' contract arrangements. The first area in which it worked&mdash;and worked very successfully, I might add&mdash;was in the building construction industry. This proposed legislation is targeted directly at it, and it is targeted against this legal background: the BWIU took action in the Federal Court before Justice Woodward in early 1989. The case that it put to Justice Woodward was that the activities of Troubleshooters should be ruled out by the Federal Court. In fact, Justice Woodward, when he had heard all the evidence and information, upheld the position of Troubleshooters. In summing up, in his judgment he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Individuals or groups have the right to choose whether they wish to work as a contractor or contractors, combined, or for a contractor.</PARA>
<PARA>The union then appealed the decision to the Full Bench of the Federal Court. The Federal Court upheld the decision of Justice Woodward. The BWIU then sought leave to appeal to the High Court in regard to the decisions of both Justice Woodward of the Federal Court and the Full Bench of the Federal Court. The High Court looked at the evidence in the case and rejected the application to appeal to the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been upheld by both the Federal Court and the High Court of Australia, the highest court in the land, that Troubleshooters, the contractors referred to in this press release&mdash;and I will refer to further evidence of that in a moment or two&mdash;is operating an activity which is within the law of this country. They have upheld not only the operations of Troubleshooters, but also the rights of individuals&mdash;something that Senator Bishop was talking about a moment ago&mdash;to determine whether they want to work as a contractor, whether they want to work as a group in forming a contract arrangement, or whether they want to work for a contractor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to fill in some of the background to this decision that has been made by the Minister in giving notice of his intention to introduce this legislation which will, in effect, as I said, force contractors in this country to have no other option but to be pressured, regarding the arrangements they make, into taking another aspect into account in terms of award coverage. Contractors should have the right to determine how they want to take on a particular task, the period of time involved and the conditions under which that particular task will be carried out. I want to highlight first a letter from the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia to Mr Bill Kelty, Secretary of the ACTU. It is signed by Tom McDonald, National Secretary. I will read the first four paragraphs of this letter:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequences of the agreement between the BLF and Troubleshooters is an important matter for the trade union movement and trade unionists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement represents the first major breakthrough for the New Right in its efforts to take the Australian work force out of the award and arbitration system and into the quagmire of contracting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This development represents a serious threat to the future of the trade union movement because, as history shows, contracting leads to a breakdown of union organisation and membership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">BWIU have been in a long running battle with Troubleshooters and has incurred legal costs to the order of $200,000 and is currently facing legal action by Troubleshooters for damages against the union.</PARA>
<PARA>I read that particularly to highlight two things. One is that this decision by the Minister results from a dispute between the BWIU and the Builders Labourers Federation. We have had some discussion in this chamber in recent times in terms of the position of mega-unions. I will no go into that today.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It also highlights the direct move by the BWIU to the Secretary of the ACTU to override, by whatever means available, the decision of Justice Woodward, as I said, which was upheld by, first, the Full Bench of the Federal Court and, second, the High Court&mdash;that fundamental decision or principle that individuals have the right to choose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is rather interesting that four hours after my question to the Minister yesterday, when we got an emphatic `no', a press release was put out which is quite different from the answer that was given to me yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the next piece of information. On 14 February 1992 we had another letter&mdash;I have it here&mdash;from the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia to its membership. I am not going to read the whole letter, only a paragraph of it. It says&mdash;and note the date, 14 February 1992; yesterday was 1 April 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have also been vindicated by the fact that the Federal Government has announced its intention to pass legislation making the Troubleshooters' type of arrangements illegal by changing the Federal Industrial Relations Act.</PARA>
<PARA>This highlights the fact that the BWIU was informed at least before 14 February 1992 of the position, yet yesterday, in answer to a question of mine in this chamber, the Minister could not tell us what the Government's intentions were. He answered emphatically, `No', yet four hours later he could put out a press release highlighting the situation. That proves quite conclusively that the Minister has more regard for his position, which in the past has been with the BWIU, than he has for this Senate chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make some general comments on workplace reform. The Minister referred today to those people in the cottage industries. He implied that what he called `genuine contractors'&mdash;he did not use these words but that is what he meant&mdash;would not have their arrangements in terms of housing construction, which have served this nation well for a long time, put in jeopardy. That is not correct. The legislation will increase disputation regarding the building of homes and units, et cetera, and will create unnecessary disruption on those sites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it goes further than that. What the legislation is also saying is that Australian industrial relations have to stand still. He says in his answer that if it has been the practice in the past&mdash;and I refer to construction sites&mdash;we are going to have to stay with the old practices of the past; we cannot progress into the twenty-first century. As we move into the twenty-first century  we could well see&mdash;and I believe that we will&mdash;totally different arrangements to those that have prevailed in the past on building sites and on any other manufacturing sites in this country. It is irresponsible of the Minister to stop progress in terms of modernising our contracting practice and keeping pace with the best international practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Thailand, for example, where I was recently, they would not put up with this nonsense. They work a contract system and they work around the clock under the arrangements they have in their contract system. America also has a contract system. I say to Government senators and to the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook: why should Australia not adopt the best contracting practices which exist in other countries? I reiterate my claim in my question today: Senator Cook in his answer yesterday to this Senate misled the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The practice of stating at the beginning of the answer to a question that it is either wrong or it is weird has been followed a couple of times this week, and it is very poor. I must say to the Minister at the table, Senator Tate, that I have not yet heard him adopt that practice in this chamber, and I hope that he does not do so. But I would ask him to convey to his colleagues that it is a not a desirable practice in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My claim that we were misled by the Minister is borne out by the facts. I refer to an article published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> last week by Paddy McGuinness. He said words to the effect that Senator Cook's official title in this place was Minister for Industrial Relations, but in the real world it was the Minister for the Prime Minister and Bill Kelty. I would like to add, in the light of the material that I have raised here in this place today, that the title be extended to Minister for the BWIU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook is determined to wipe out what has been a very successful innovation in terms of contracting that has been introduced by troubleshooters in the construction industry and other industries in this country. I would warn&mdash;notify all contractors that if this legislation goes through in the context in which it has been put out in the press release by the Minister they will all be affected because they will become part of the dispute process in this country. Once that happens, they will be subject to scrutiny by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One certainly does, Senator Boswell, as I have realised very quickly. From a national perspective, once I arrived in Jordan I realised&mdash;and was told in fact&mdash;that I was the first member of the Federal Parliament to visit Jordan since the Gulf war. From that point of view the Jordanian Government certainly regarded my humble presence as an important event. I was accorded a great welcome and enormous hospitality by members of His Majesty's government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While in Jordan I had the good fortune to be invited to participate in the University of Sydney's archaeological mission to Pella, about which I want to say a few  words. Pella is a large site in the northern Jordan located some three kilometres east of the Jordan River, opposite Bet She'an in Israel. It is perhaps one of the most important sites in Jordan. In fact, it has been recognised as one of the most important sites in the entire Levantine region. Indeed, Sydney University is very privileged to have a long association with the work in that place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The site contains habitation remains from the chalcolithic period, roughly 4500 BC, to modern Islamic remains. The nearby region is rewriting the prehistory of humankind, with Aechulien stone tools dating to circa 250,000 BC located in the rock strata. These stone tools were located by the Sydney University team at its last season and in previous years, and I had the privilege of personally examining those implements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sydney University has been working at the site for nearly 15 years examining not only the main tell but the neighbouring region. Under the auspices of Professor Basil Hennessy, successive teams have progressively uncovered a broad range of remains spanning all the periods that I have outlined. Following a brief hiatus caused by the Gulf war, the team of which I was a member returned once again to excavate the main tell under the auspices of Dr Stephen Bourke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Work concentrated in the main area where several existing trenches were reopened to gain a further understanding of the underlying strata. By the season's end important early Bronze Age housing had been unearthed, along with the remains of an early Bronze Age fortress dating to roughly 3000 BC. Further work was conducted on the so-called late Bronze Age governor's residence dating to 1300 BC, or the late eighteenth, early nineteenth dynasty in Egypt, at the time of Rameses the Great. A beautiful clay astarte figurine&mdash;complete&mdash;was one of the most important finds of this period that was found at the recent excavations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spent a total of three weeks in the field, excavating a small two by two metre sondage that had been uncovered in an area in which a large amount of remains from the early Iron Age period had already been uncovered. My goal was to dig as quickly as I could to excavate down to the bedrock at the base of the habitation remains. After three weeks I had excavated a three metre deep trench and had in fact achieved my research goal of reaching the bedrock and in doing so had uncovered quite substantial layers of human habitation floor remains and a dump fill which had been placed upon those floors by people in ancient times. </PARA>

The work is funded by a grant from the ARC and by a special grant from the Australian National Gallery. These two organisations recognise the international importance of the project, both in scholarly and foreign policy terms. I would like to dwell on that latter point for a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia and Australians are well regarded in Jordan as well as in the rest of the Middle East. We have significant trade links. In fact, in 1990, 4.8 per cent of our total exports went to countries in that region. Half of those exports were wheat but many more were other primary products. Manufactured goods and minerals processing products are becoming an increasing part of Australian exports to that region. In addition, we have significant and expanding markets for barley and other processed exports. To this extent it is my hope and the hope of the Democrats that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Australian businesses will seek to expand the opportunities that exist for Australian primary products in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jordan, by comparison, is not a large trading partner for Australia as it ranks as our sixty-ninth largest export market and is outside the top 10 of our largest Middle Eastern trading partners.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter of concern regarding the conduct of one of the Government's key business regulatory agencies. For some 18 months the Trade Practices Commission has pursued, at massive cost to both itself and thus the Commonwealth and the Australian taxpayer, and at a similar massive cost to a respected trade association, the Motor Trades Association of Australia (MTAA), a course of action which has led to charges being laid against the Service Station Association of New South Wales, its honorary president and its executive director. The Service Station Association of New South Wales is a member of the MTAA. I do not want to canvass the substance of the issues involved; they will be decided in a case commencing in the Federal Court on 15 June. Considering the limited amount of time available, I seek leave to have my copious notes incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The notes read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As background, however, the alleged breaches of the Trade Practices Act relate to a campaign endorsed by the Board of Directors of the Motor Trades Association of Australia known as `Prosper from Petrol'. The aim of this education campaign, elements of which were also adopted by a number of other member bodies of MTAA was to educate service station operators in how to avoid selling petrol at a loss and thus to earn a decent return of their labour and capital investment. At the time it was launched, many thousands of service station operators were in serious financial difficulty and were running their businesses at a loss, as indeed they still are.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Details of this campaign were put before the TPC by the MTAA who, in fact, asked the TPC for its advice. At no time did the TPC  advise that any part of the campaign was unacceptable. I am seriously concerned at the TPC's conduct in assembling its case and I believe that the Attorney-General should be making himself aware of the circumstances surrounding:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the way that witnesses were treated</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission has investigated similar allegations against individuals in the past but unlike its previous investigations, in this instance the Commission wheeled out the intimidatory and draconian powers available to it under Section 155 of the Trade Practices Act. Service station operators were required to present themselves for an examination by counsel for, and officials of, the TPC in circumstances where, on occasion, this interrogation continued over several days. Those who had to appear were discouraged from having legal representation and initially were denied access to transcripts of their interviews.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, in submitting themselves for questioning they were required under oath to answer questions even if those answers might incriminate them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is totally at odds with the basic natural justice and legal principles on which Australian society is based.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears that the TPC have brought out the cannons and opened fire without first identifying the enemy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am also concerned that the TPC in pursuing its case decided to begin legal action against a trade association and its members without first raising its concerns with that association. This is despite a cordial and accessible relationship between the TPC and the MTAA, whose executive director has served as a member of the TPC's national consultative committee since 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The MTAA has cooperated with government bodies including the TPC and the Prices Surveillance Authority to address structural problems confronting the petroleum industry. Immediately prior to the commencement of the TPC's investigations MTAA had committed substantial resources to assist the TPC in its review of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cooperation between MTAA and the TPC led to the introduction of a voluntary code of practice known as `oilcode' to resolve disputes between refiners and petrol resellers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am puzzled and alarmed therefore by the TPC's behaviour. Why did the TPC not raise its concerns with MTAA about the matters it is pursuing in the Federal court?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why did the TPC begin a covert investigation whilst informing that its `Prosper from Petrol' campaign was acceptable?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why did the TPC advise MTAA's members that they could lawfully issue recommended prices under the Trade Practices Act if the TPC had any concerns about the campaign?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Trade Practices Act specifically sets out that the TPC has the power and, it might be argued, a duty to enter a process of discussion and negotiation. Such a conciliatory approach may have alerted the Association to the TPC's concerns and allowed for amicable resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Instead it embarked on a course of:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am concerned that the TPC showed no inclination to discuss or even indicate its concerns. Instead it has chosen in a cavalier fashion to manipulate a section of the Trade Practices Act to assault a voluntary body.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are left wondering where this must leave the elected officials who perform sterling voluntary service in the hundreds of trade and industry associations scattered throughout Australia. If at some future time they are to be singled out for such action by the TPC for some perceived fault then very quickly those associations will die. Who would wish to take the risk of being an office-holder in the face of the risks which have come to light through this unprecedented action?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate and the Parliament must take this matter very seriously. I intend to take the matter further by asking the Attorney-General his view as to</PARA>

Senator Chamarette asserted that Western Australia senators or members or State members of parliament&mdash;I am not too sure exactly who, because she seemed to get the terminology all garbled; she specifically referred to Opposition members&mdash;had gone up to Ashburton in the Pilbara, where there is a by-election this Saturday, to try to con Aboriginal members of the community. `Con' may not have been the exact word that she used&mdash;I was in my office when I heard her make the statement&mdash;but denying them their rights was certainly the implication of what she was trying to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it crystal clear that Senator Chamarette should make sure that her facts are straight before she comes into the Senate. We have quite enough misrepresentation of the facts here in the Senate by the Government on the Fightback package alone, without Senator Chamarette coming in here and making stupid and outrageous assertions that we were going to Ashburton and denying the Aboriginal communities their rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was in the Pilbara in the last month for nearly four days, a trip that was not originally associated in any way, shape or form with the Ashburton by-election as it was organised last November. I regularly speak to people who have contact with the Aboriginal communities up there, and there was no hint whatsoever of any denial of rights for the Aborigines. I think Senator Chamarette should come into this chamber and apologise to both me and my colleagues whom she has tried to cast a slur upon today in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To also come in here and assert that there is some sinister reason that the debate on the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody has somehow been shelved by the Opposition because we are too afraid to debate it, is equally outrageous. Once Senator Chamarette understands how this place operates, she might come to the awareness that other things that have been rather significant and important have been on the agenda this week, for example something called Estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the Opposition cannot control what the Government wants to put on the agenda. Government Business has taken precedence in many cases. We generally like to make sure that we respond to reports such as that on the day they are tabled in this chamber, but on this occasion that was not possible. Once again, for her to say that there is something sinister behind that is absolute and utter rot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Michael Wooldridge, the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs who is in the House of Representatives, will be making a full and comprehensive statement on that report this afternoon. Once again, I think it is about time Senator Chamarette learnt a few courtesies, let alone how to be accurate in some of the things that she says. I want to make it crystal clear to anyone who may have heard or who reads what Senator Chamarette has said that there is absolutely no truth to any of what she said today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Senate should be grateful to Senator Knowles for making it aware of the statements that Senator Chamarette has made because I find those statements that she has been reported to have made quite offensive. Usually, when people become members of the Senate, they wait for a few weeks until they understand the system before they become critical. But the new senator appears to have put her foot right in her proverbial mouth. She may come into this Senate believing that she is the only one concerned about Aboriginal welfare, but she is going to find that this Senate gives bipartisan support for the welfare of our indigenous community. So if she comes in here and accuses the Government and the Opposition of not being interested or not being prepared to debate the very important issue of Aboriginal deaths in custody, she is being absolutely ignorant and showing no respect for her colleagues on all sides of the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the prime reason that I rose today. I am concerned about the Government's decision to ban tobacco advertising. I am concerned for a number of reasons. What does one ban next?  If one bans a legal product&mdash;it is legal to sell it, it is legal to produce it, it is legal to use it&mdash;then there are a lot of other ramifications. What is next&mdash;alcohol, guns, or anything about which people may hold a different view? I think it is a very dangerous precedent to set. It is not, in my opinion, in the best interests of the overall community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the arguments for the banning; I understand them only too well. I have chosen not to smoke, and my family has done likewise. But to construe that we should ban tobacco advertising because of health reasons is something that does not sit very well with me. If the Senate wished to debate whether tobacco should be banned because it is a health risk, I think that would be a more direct way to go. If we were to ban tobacco as a product, then the Senate could argue the merits of that. But what we are trying to do is to have it both ways&mdash;to have a product that is legal and one which we are trying to choke by underhand methods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned also for the 600 tobacco growers who make their living from the tobacco industry. The region of Queensland that relies totally on the tobacco growing industry is an area around Mareeba, and 350-odd tobacco growers came to Canberra only a couple of weeks ago to see the Government, and were here this week to see the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make this point very strongly: there are moves to get rid of that tobacco industry by taking the mix of 57 per cent from the industry and by a number of other ways that are going to weaken the industry, including the removal of advertising. I say to the Senate that if these tobacco growers lose their industry and the industry does close down in north Queensland, where about 60 per cent of the tobacco is grown, that is not going to solve the health problem in Australia, because that product that is grown in Australia will be replaced by imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be argued that, because of subsidies and a number of other market distortions, tobacco will come into Australia at a much cheaper rate, which would encourage more people to smoke. But I am concerned, as I have said before, that it is the thin edge of the wedge, as I think one other senator mentioned. Neither the Government's decision nor the Opposition's response has gone to the party room. When it does, I will be arguing very strongly to vote against any reduction or any removal of tobacco advertising in Australia. It is up to everyone to make a decision on whether they want to smoke cigarettes or not. People should have the liberty to make the choice. To take people's choice away from them and to interfere with the right of companies to advertise a legal product is not in the best interests of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank those senators who have contributed to the adjournment debate. I simply want to put on the record my appreciation of the services of two members of my parliamentary office staff who are leaving after many years of devoted service, Mr Daryl Smeaton and Miss Sally Anderson. Mr Daryl Smeaton has been my senior adviser for almost the whole term of my being a Minister in this Labor Government. I pay tribute to his perseverance and commitment in relation to many issues. I am quite sure that, for example, the restructuring of the Australian Federal Police and the agreement of the Premiers to a uniform approach to sensible gun regulation, to the possession of guns in this community, would not have occurred but for that persistence and commitment on his part&mdash;quite apart, of course, from those many instances of personal loyalty and unfailing good humour which helped to keep an office together.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The press release to which Senator Alston's question refers indicated that the complexities of the Opposition's superannuation package combined with the proposed increase in taxation of fund earnings from 15 to 25 per cent would increase the tax on many people's superannuation and that this would reduce national savings. An increase in the earnings tax will directly reduce the after-tax earnings of superannuation funds and is likely to reduce the incentive, particularly for those people on a marginal tax rate of 20 per cent, for accumulating superannuation savings.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Government's policies will ensure that virtually all employees will be making superannuation savings equivalent to at least 9 per cent of earnings by the year 2000. This can be expected to increase national savings over time because:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">higher superannuation savings will not be fully offset by reductions in other savings because many employees do not have equivalent levels of non-superannuation savings and superannuation savings are not a perfect substitute for other savings; and</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The scope for wages growth from other sources will necessarily be lower than otherwise so as to ensure that enhanced superannuation does not impact adversely on cost structures, inflation and employment. If wages growth were to become inconsistent with achieving inflation rates comparable with those of our major trading partners, the Government will reconsider the scheduled timing of increases in the prescribed minimum standard of superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The SGL is not expected to impact on Government revenues in its first year of operation, because superannuation taxation revenue is collected with a lag of one year. The SGL will reduce revenues in later years due to the lower average tax rate applying to remuneration paid as superannuation contributions. However, the effect of the SGL on Government savings cannot be isolated from the broader setting of fiscal policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The SGL is a retirement incomes policy initiative designed to encourage employers to comply with their obligation to provide superannuation support to their employees. It cannot be characterised as a payroll tax because it applies only where an employer has not provided adequate superannuation cover in respect of his or her employees and because an equivalent amount to the revenue raised, less administrative expenses, is redistributed in the form of superannuation contributions to the affected employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) Some substitution of superannuation for non-superannuation savings can reasonably be expected.
