<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill makes amendments to 8 Acts administered within the Transport and Communications portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the amendments are of a technical nature and represent a "fine tuning" and clarification of provisions of various Acts administered within the portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments do not introduce substantial new policy schemes, although some of the amendments introduce minor policy initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will not deal with the minor technical amendments in this speech, but will instead concentrate on each of the more significant amendments in turn.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill amends the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act to allow the ABC to carry corporate sponsorship and promotional material on its new international satellite service to South-East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The service will initially be provided on a free-to-air basis to enable the ABC to develop an audience. It will convert to an encrypted signal after the first one to two years, drawing income partly from subscriptions and partly from paid sponsorship announcements and promotional programming. There will be no spot promotional commercials carried on the service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment applies only to the ABC's international satellite television service and its associated audio channels. It will not enable the ABC to take sponsorship or promotional programming on its domestic services or on Radio Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that the satellite service will have far reaching foreign and trade policy benefits for Australia and will improve Australian information and cultural penetration of the South-East Asian area. The acceptance of sponsorship announcements and promotional programming on the service will enhance its financial viability. I applaud the ABC for this initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is totally committed both to the protection  of fundamental human rights under the law and to the important role of the media in protection of the public interest. However, it recognises that, in legislation dealing with the media, there is likely to be conflict between the need for journalists to protect their sources of confidential information and for the courts to gather all relevant information. In those cases, we rely heavily on the judgment of the courts to protect journalistic sources wherever possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot compromise the principle that all citizens are bound to give information necessary to the administration of justice. No one is above the law. What we can do is try to strike an appropriate balance between two basic protections of our democratic society. The Broadcasting Services Act 1992 sought to do so by providing a confidential investigation function which would apply in the very few cases where identification of a confidential source would be relevant to an ABA decision. However, journalists have said this process could be abused by unscrupulous litigants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Media Alliance has asked for amendments to the Act to make it a reasonable excuse for a journalist, at an ABA investigation or hearing, to refuse to answer a question or produce a document if to do so would disclose a confidential source of material used in a broadcast program. The Government considers this proposal to be reasonable and the Bill includes amendments to implement it. The amendments will not compromise the basic legal principles since the powers of the courts remain unimpaired, but avoids possible abuse of the ABA processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments of the Civil Aviation Act 1988</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill amends the Civil Aviation Act to provide greater flexibility in the method of determining charges under the Act and to provide a mechanism under which charges can be waived or remitted in appropriate cases. The Bill also amends the Act's regulation-making provision to expressly provide that regulations can be made under the Act which deal with the design and manufacture of aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments of the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act will significantly reduce the amount of oil discharged into the sea during the normal operations of ships. The amendments are a direct result of changes to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, known as MARPOL 73/78. This Convention has been accepted by 70 countries representing some 90% of world shipping tonnage. It is expected that the amendments included in the Bill will enter into force globally on 6 July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments have two main objectives. Firstly, the present standard for the discharge in near-coastal zones and special areas of oily wastes and residues from machinery spaces is to apply to all sea areas. The oil content in permitted discharges is not to exceed 15 parts per million. Secondly, the amendments will improve the standard for the instantaneous rate of discharge of oil or oily mixtures from cargo tanks of oil tankers outside special areas by reducing the permitted rate of discharge from 60 to 30 litres per nautical mile. For existing ships, the new requirements will be phased in over a period of five years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impact of these amendments on the shipping industry will be negligible. More than 86% of all ships are already fitted with the required 15 parts per million filtering equipment and the manufacture of 100 parts per million equipment has been almost entirely discontinued.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that the will, technology and equipment now exist within the international shipping community to take this step towards the fundamental goal of MARPOL 73/78 which is the complete elimination of intentional pollution of the marine environment. The present discharge standards were formulated more than 20 years ago when the subject was new, concern for the environment was not as acute as it is today, and the technology was not available to achieve such low discharge levels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments of the Telecommunications Act 1991</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill makes a large number of amendments to the Telecommunications Act. These amendments come within 4 categories. I will deal with each of these categories in turn.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Access Agreements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 8 of the Telecommunications Act gives telecommunications carriers rights of access to the networks and services of other carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under that Part, carriers can negotiate access agreements and variations of such agreements, AUSTEL can arbitrate when negotiations break down and AUSTEL can register completed agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An access agreement has been negotiated between AOTC Limited and Optus Communications and was registered by AUSTEL on 19 August 1992. The AOTC/OPTUS access agreement  is an agreement between 3 carriers by virtue of the fact that the OPTUS licences are held by two subsidiary companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to signing the agreement, concerns were raised as to whether the provisions of Part 8 of the Telecommunications Act envisage the registration by AUSTEL of a multi-party access agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has been approached by AUSTEL and the carriers seeking amendments to the Act which will ensure that there is no doubt about the legal status of the access agreement and the related matters which led to and give effect to it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments clarify the current provisions of the Act to ensure that there is no legal uncertainty in relation to the making of access agreements between more than two carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Protection of Communications</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 88 of the Telecommunications Act deals with the protection of communications. Section 88 creates obligations on employees and former employees of carriers not to disclose or use confidential personal or commercial information for purposes other than those prescribed in the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill amends section 88 to extend these obligations to suppliers and former suppliers of eligible services and their employees and former employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment is necessary to protect such information in a consistent way, given that service providers will have increasing access to calling line identification information for the purpose of billing their own customers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also amends the Telecommunications Act to facilitate the creation and operation of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman by the telecommunications carriers. The Government required the carriers to enter into a Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman Scheme as a condition of their carrier licences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the scheme, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (the TIO) will investigate unresolved complaints by consumers about any matters relating to service, billing and the manner of charging for telecommunications services (other than investigation of the setting of tariffs). The proposed amendments will ensure that there are no impediments to the free flow of information between the TIO, participants and complainants in the investigation of complaints, and specifically enable AUSTEL to refer complaints to the TIO.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rules relating to the general carriers' reserved rights</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill contains some minor amendments to clarify the reserved rights of the general carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, the amendments will ensure that, subject to  certain exceptions, the general carriers will retain the reserved right to install or maintain line links on a property whose title is not defined by reference to geographical coordinates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also clarify the status of certain reserved line links which the Telecommunications Act allows to be installed and maintained by other persons as exceptions to the carriers' reserved rights in relation to line links. If the title over "excepted" line links passes to another person, those line links are required to be used for the purpose for which they were originally excepted or within the scope of an authorisation previously granted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures contained in this Bill are expected to have no significant effect on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Details about the minor technical amendments in the Bill which I have not referred to in this speech are contained in the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RADIOCOMMUNICATIONS (TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Radiocommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1992 provides for the saving of regulations made, instruments granted or various actions commenced under the Radiocommunications Act 1983 which is to be replaced by the proposed Radiocommunications Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transitional provisions included in the Bill deem various instruments made under the 1983 Act to have been made under the new Act. For example, clause 4 saves transmitter licences in force under the 1983 Act and continues them in force as if they had been issued by the  Spectrum Management Agency established under the new Act. Consultation procedures which have been undertaken under the 1983 Act for the purposes of making certain instruments will be deemed to have been done under the corresponding provisions of the new Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also provides for consequential amendments to a number of other Acts by replacing outdated references to the 1983 Act. These consequential amendments are set out  in the Schedule. The Bill also includes amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1991 to allow AUSTEL to include in standards made under that Act, matters related to interference to radiocommunications. This will avoid the need for issuing separate technical standards under the 1992 Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also repeals the Radiocommunications Act 1983, the Radiocommunications (Frequency Reservation Certificate Tax) Act 1983 and the Radiocommunications (Temporary Permit Tax) Act 1983. Frequency reservation certificates and temporary permits will no longer be required under the new radiocommunications licensing scheme provided for under the Radiocommunications Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to abolish frequency reservation certificates implements one of the recommendations of the report on spectrum management prepared by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. As a transitional measure, clause 7 allows existing certificates to continue, but these will not be re-issued upon their expiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The explanatory memorandum sets out the purpose of the provisions in more detail. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">RADIOCOMMUNICATIONS BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Introduction</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my statement to the Parliament on 15 September 1992, I outlined the Government's reform strategy for spectrum management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My statement followed the Government's acceptance of the 1991 report on spectrum management by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. The Committee had recommended substantial changes, in view of the increasing importance of spectrum management and the communications industry generally in the development of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Radiocommunications Bill 1992 and the related legislation being introduced in the Parliament gives effect to those changes. The new Bill will replace the existing Radiocommunications Act 1983. As well as including the reform measures I outlined in my earlier statement, the Bill incorporates provisions from existing legislation which are not being substantially changed, although the opportunity has been taken to modernise the drafting of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following my earlier statement, the Department of Transport and Communications has undertaken consultations with users and industry groups and the views expressed have been taken into consideration in drafting of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Bill is fairly technical in nature it represents a significant reform measure which complements and extends the government's reforms in telecommunications and broadcasting. The reforms are innovative and broad ranging in their implications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes contained in this Bill are directed to the future. The spectrum is an important resource in the development of communications services. The new management regime contained in the Bill provides for increased flexibility to meet the demands of a rapidly changing communications environment. Over time, it will lead to a more efficient allocation and use of spectrum which will improve the benefits for all users of radiocommunications. The new arrangements will allow a more rapid introduction of new technologies and services. There will also be increased opportunities for Australian manufacturers of equipment and a more competitive supply of services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not propose to go into a detailed description of all the features of the Bill. Instead I would like to concentrate on some of the more significant and innovative changes being introduced. Senators wishing further detail should consult the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Market-based Reforms</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps the most innovative change being introduced in the Bill is the introduction of a market-based system of spectrum management in selected areas of the spectrum. It was perhaps the key recommendation of the HORSCOTCI report and is a major feature of the new legislation. The current system of licensing, which the Bill now refers to as "apparatus licensing", is based on the issue of annual licences to operate specified types of transmitters for specified purposes. These licences are subject to strict technical constraints and cannot be traded. This system is cumbersome and inflexible in many of its applications and cannot readily cope with the increasingly rapid pace of technological change and commercial initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new market-based system of licensing contained in Part 3.2 of the Bill represents a radical departure from this traditional approach. The cornerstone of the new system will be a new type of licence, to be called a "spectrum licence" which will provide explicit and continuing rights to spectrum access in defined parts of the spectrum in defined geographic areas. These licences will be freely tradeable and will be able to be split or amalgamated to suit the needs of users. The licence will allow users to determine the use they make of that spectrum and, within the constraints of the standards regime, the type of equipment they use. They will also be able to authorise third parties to use spectrum under their control without the need for further licensing. Licensees will be free to buy spectrum access rights on a local, State or national level or any combination in between. They will also be able to amalgamate licences to create large blocks of spectrum which they will be able to manage themselves. Spectrum licences will be issued for periods of up to 10 years which will provide a secure term for users. They will generally be allocated by a price-based allocation system but will only have to pay low annual fees related to the costs of administration of spectrum management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Introduction of the market-based approach will occur selectively and progressively under the control of the Minister. Other spectrum will remain under the administrative system, resulting in a dual market/administratively-based system of spectrum management. The Bill provides opportunity for public consultation during the transition to the market-based system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once the Minister has designated a part of the spectrum for conversion to the market system, Part 2.2 of the Bill provides for two processes as to how spectrum licences are to be issued. Firstly, conversion plans will be developed by the SMA to convert existing apparatus licences to spectrum licences. Licensees will be offered spectrum licences, subject to payment of a spectrum access charge. The spectrum access charge will be determined according to a Ministerial policy direction which will be a disallowable instrument. Secondly, marketing plans will be developed for the sale of spectrum licences for unencumbered spectrum by auction, tender or for a pre-determined or negotiated price.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In line with the recommendations of the HORSCOTCI report spectrum access rights will not be perpetual. There will be no automatic right of renewal of spectrum licences at the end of the fixed term. However the SMA will be able to renew licences if this is in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The market-based system will not apply to broadcasting services bands used for AM/FM radio and VHF/UHF television. These bands will continue to be planned by the Australian Broadcasting Authority under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HORSCOTCI identified two areas of potential concern with a market-based system&mdash;interference and access by non-commercial users. Special attention has been given to these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill contains a number of explicit procedures to deal with interference. But the heart of the matter is to confer on the holders of licences the right to use the spectrum without interference. This right can then be protected at law. In support of this concept the Bill provides for five related measures. Firstly, spectrum licences will be subject to specified emission limits outside the areas of spectrum under their control. Secondly, all high powered transmitters operating under a spectrum licence, or any other licence, whether by the licensee or by authorised third parties, will need to be registered with the SMA. Thirdly, the SMA will be able to reject registration or changes to licences where this would result in interference to other services. In support of those processes the SMA will be accrediting non-government engineers and others, under the accreditation scheme in Part 5.4 of the Bill, to issue certificates to licensees about the impact of their proposed changes on other services. Fourthly, spectrum licensees will be able to initiate civil proceedings in the Federal Court under clause 50 against persons unlawfully interfering with their services. Fifthly, the SMA will be able to appoint conciliators to deal with any interference disputes that may arise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SMA will be able to designate frequency bands for exclusive use by public or community services anywhere in the spectrum. Special provisions are also included to ensure public or community services have access to spectrum within the market system. The SMA will be able to reserve spectrum licences for direct sale to such organisations, in some cases at concessional rates set in line with Ministerial policy direction. For example, community organisations solely devoted to safety of life who currently do not pay licence fees will not have to pay spectrum access charges for their spectrum licences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concern had been expressed to HORSCOTCI that a market-based system of spectrum management would lead to permanent alienation of spectrum in private hands and that this could prevent the government from introducing new services which would be in the national interest or could eventually deny spectrum for essential public or community services. To deal with such possibilities the SMA is empowered under the Bill to purchase spectrum licences in the open market or to resume spectrum licences by compulsory process subject to payment of just compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Administrative and Other Reforms</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now want to turn to some of the other changes being  introduced in this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important initiative is the introduction of a new scheme for determination of standards and other forms of technical regulation. The setting of technical standards is an important tool for achieving efficiency in spectrum use and minimising interference. With the proliferation, on the one hand, of communications services that depend on spectrum and, on the other, with electric and electronic equipment which affects and can in turn be affected by radiocommunications transmitters, there is increasing need to provide mechanisms to ensure compatibility. The Bill provides for an updated, more flexible scheme of technical regulation designed to achieve those objectives. It also provides for the making of agreements with Standards Australia for the drafting of standards and technical licence specifications, for recognition of overseas standards without the need for additional type testing of equipment and for devolution of compliance testing of equipment to recognised laboratories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Spectrum Management Agency (SMA) being established by the Bill will in future issue apparatus licences. The Government recognises that changes are also required in this area. The current system of approximately 130 licence categories, with a wide disparity in the level of fees paid, needs to be made simpler, more rational and more equitable. One of the first tasks of the new SMA will be to undertake a review of the existing administrative licensing and pricing system, following an opportunity for public input.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new system of class licensing is being provided for under the Bill. A class licence is an open, standing authority allowing anyone to operate a device provided this is in keeping with the conditions of licence. Class licences will be introduced for those low powered devices and services which do not require individual licensing, for example remote control devices such as garage door openers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions relating to the conciliation of interference disputes have also been updated and a publicly accessible on-line data base on all licences and frequency assignments is to be established to assist in the registration of licences and frequency assignments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other changes will allow the SMA to determine classes of apparatus licences, thereby streamlining the licensing process; will increase the maximum period of such licences to 5 years; and will introduce an explicit renewal procedure into the legislation. Further changes will allow the SMA to make arrangements with banks and post offices for the collection of licence fees and charges. This should be of particular benefit to users in country areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Opportunity has also been taken, in consultation with the Attorney-General's Department, to review the offence and penalty provisions of the legislation and to remove a number of anomalies. The new penalties recognise the increasing importance of interference-free communications, particularly in situations involving  safety of life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Spectrum Management Agency</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The success of the reforms contained in this Bill will depend on having an efficient and effective organisation to implement them. There is a need for an organisation which is responsive to the needs of users, and able to manage market based reforms. Such an organisation requires greater administrative flexibility and accountability than is possible under current arrangements. Accordingly the Bill establishes a specialist spectrum management agency to administer the new arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Spectrum Management Agency (SMA) will be established as a separate statutory agency within the Transport and Communications portfolio and will have a structure similar to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Customs and similar bodies. Like those agencies it will operate within the legal umbrella of the Commonwealth. It will not be a statutory authority with its own body corporate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be headed by a statutory officer, to be called the Spectrum Manager, appointed by the Governor-General for a term of up to 5 years. The Spectrum Manager will have the powers of a Departmental Secretary. SMA staff will be appointed under the Public Service Act 1922. Approximately 350 to 400 of the staff within the Department of Transport and Communications engaged in spectrum management related activities will be transferred to the new agency. Its headquarters will remain in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SMA will be more user oriented and will bring a sharper focus to spectrum management issues. It will have increased planning and operational flexibility but will be more transparent and accountable in its method of operation. The SMA will be required to provide an annual report and will present its corporate plan and financial projections to the Minister. Its major decisions will be effected through disallowable instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SMA will also be able to establish committees to advise on its operations. The recently established Radiocommunications Consultative Council is an example of the consultative process now to be adopted, bringing together representatives of users of the spectrum to provide views on future policy and management directions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SMA will operate on a full cost recovery basis. It will charge users for services and facilities provided to them. The overhead costs of the SMA will be recovered through a relatively small annual charge on all licensees. In the case of spectrum licensees this will be the only annual charge that they will have to pay. Spectrum access charges for sale of spectrum licences will be returned to Consolidated Revenue. Annual licence fees paid by apparatus licensees are currently levied as taxes under related taxing legislation, with the level of the tax being set by regulations under those Acts. This is in recognition of the fact that these fees are not necessarily related only to costs or to the value of those licences. As mentioned earlier, it is the government's intention to move to a more rational, equitable system of setting annual licence fees for such licences and this will be one of the first major tasks of the new agency. Until a new scheme is in place these fees will continue to be levied under the tax Acts, but the level of the fee will in future be determined by the SMA through the use of disallowable instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, I would add that the measures included in this Bill provide for the most comprehensive reform of spectrum management ever undertaken in Australia. They will provide Australia with a system of spectrum management appropriate for a modern communications based economy, one better able to respond to a rapidly changing international communications environment.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the challenge to the decision to exclude from Australia, non Australian members of the Hell's Angels Motor Cycle Club, there has been close scrutiny of the decision making regime for the exclusion of persons of bad character and of persons generally who may represent a danger to the Australian community or a segment of it. This Bill represents the results of that process and enables the Minister to exclude from Australia persons of bad character and other undesirable persons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides that, from the dates of commencement, certain decisions under the Migration Act will be subject to determinative merits review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The commencement dates take account of the fact that some provisions in the Bill apply to the Migration Act in its current form and others will only apply to provisions introduced into the Act by the Migration Reform Bill which are scheduled to come into operation on 1 November 1993, if passed by the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides the Minister or his or her delegate, with the power to refuse or cancel a visa or entry permit where a person fails to meet the character criteria set out in the Act. There is also a power for the Minister, acting personally, to refuse or cancel visas or entry permits where, on the basis of information available to the Minister, he or she is satisfied that a person, if permitted to enter or remain in Australia would be likely to engage in criminal conduct or would represent a danger to the Australian community or a segment of it, or would engage in vilification of a segment of the community or would foment discord in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The power is intended to be exercised in a manner consistent with well accepted Australian values such that it is aimed at those persons who may regard entry to this country as a means to attack those values. The new provisions would not be used to breach established standards of industrial democracy, for example.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions will also not impact on the continued implementation of current Government policy in relation to criminal deportation. That policy has been effective since May 1983. It was updated in December 1988 when the then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs clarified certain important issues for the benefit and guidance of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It will be open to the Government to change that policy from time to time, in order to maintain its effectiveness, and to give appropriate direction to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Apart from re-stating it and revising and updating the policy to take account of the legislative changes, there is no need, at present, to make any major changes now. A statement of the amended policy is tabled in conjunction with this amending legislation. This will ensure the currency of Government policy on criminal deportation and provide up to date guidance to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in such matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments render unnecessary the character criteria for the grant of visas and entry permits. These are currently set out in the Migration Regulations. In future, this Bill will provide a basis in the primary legislation for refusing or cancelling visas or entry permits on the grounds of character. Under this Bill, the Minister will be able to consider whether a person is of good character by reference to a person's actual criminal conduct, his or her general conduct or by reference to a person's association with any other person, group or organisation who the Minister has reasonable grounds to believe has been or is involved in criminal conduct. Policy guidance will be developed in due course to assist those decision makers delegated with the power to make decisions under this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All decisions taken under the powers provided for in this legislation will be subject to merits review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Specifically, the decisions which will be subject to such review will be criminal deportations, decisions to refuse a visa or entry permit or decisions to cancel a visa or entry permit on the grounds of bad character or where a person may engage in criminal conduct, vilify a segment of the community, foment discord in the community or represent a danger to the community. These decisions will be subject to such review from the date of Royal Assent of this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be special arrangements for protection visas under provisions introduced by the Migration Reform Bill 1992, presently before the Parliament. Protection visas will be granted on the basis that the applicant is entitled to protection under the United Nations Convention and Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees. Decisions to refuse protection visas will be reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, where adverse determinations are made against persons such that character concerns are sufficiently serious to engage those Articles of the Convention which provide for the exclusion of an individual from the provisions of the Convention (Article 1F) or for the expulsion of a refugee (Articles 32 and 33(2)). Such decisions will only be reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on and after 1 November 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of the exercise of the new powers provided by this Bill will not be permitted, however, where the Minister, acting personally, decides that it is in the national interest that such persons should not be permitted to enter or remain in Australia. In such cases the Minister will be required to include, as part of the decision, a certificate stating that, in the national interest, the person is refused entry to or permission to remain in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In those cases where a certificate is included, the Minister will be required to table a notice of the decision in the Parliament within 15 sitting days of the taking of the decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Providing for determinative review of these cases by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, will mean that it is the sole merits review body for criminal deportation decisions, decisions refusing or cancelling visas or entry permits under the new character provisions including decisions made relying on those Articles of the Refugee Convention which allow for exclusion or expulsion of individuals and those decisions taken on the basis of information which satisfies the Minister that a person would vilify, incite discord or represent a danger to the Australian community or segment of it or would be likely to engage in criminal conduct in Australia. In these cases, the Immigration Review Tribunal, the new Refugee Review Tribunal created under the Migration Reform Bill and internal Departmental review officers will have no jurisdiction whatsoever. For the sake of clarity, any visa or entry permit refusal or cancellation involving the exercise of the powers provided for in this Bill will only be reviewable on the merits by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Tribunal, in reviewing such matters will be guided by relevant policy directives of the Government, such as the criminal deportation policy and that developed to guide the use of the powers provided for in this legislation. In such cases, this Tribunal will also then review all other aspects of the decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Review before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will only be permitted to a person whose visa or entry permit has been refused or cancelled if he or she is present in Australia at the time of the decision. If the person is not present, the Bill provides for that person's nominator or sponsor in Australia, if any, to take the matter before the Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, if a person has his or her visa or entry permit refused or cancelled, the person will be excluded from Australia for a period set out in the Migration Regulations. This will mean that, prior to 1 November 1993, those persons in Australia whose entry permits are cancelled because of these provisions, will not be permitted, after being deported, to re-enter Australia for period set out in the Regulations. After that date, criminal deportees, who will continue to be subject to deportation and persons in Australia whose visas are cancelled and who are thus liable to detention and removal from Australia as unlawful non-citizens will be similarly prevented from re-entering Australia for a period set out in the Regulations. Persons who have not entered Australia, will not be permitted to enter Australia for the period prescribed in the Regulations. The Regulations will be able to set out variable exclusion periods.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Bill is twofold. It is:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1)  to reduce the violence in "M" and "R" rated videos.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2)  to prohibit the importation, sale or hire of "X" rated videos.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1988 the Joint Select Committee enquiring into video material tabled a report containing about 30 recommendations. There were 2 areas of particular concern to the Committee regarding content: firstly the strength of the violence in videos and secondly that "X" rated videos were degrading to women and should be abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the tabling of the report, the Australian Attorney's-General met and as a result of that meeting a unanimous agreement was reached between the State Attorneys-General. It was agreed that most Australians wanted "X" rated and excessively violent videos to be outlawed and that the way to accomplish this was to have a national approach on the issue. This was necessary because while all the States had for some time banned the sale or hire of "X" rated videos under their jurisdiction, the Commonwealth had refused to do so in the Territories, resulting in the free trade of these videos being carried out between the States and Territories and so thwarting the States' legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However the Federal Government refused to abide by the combined decision of the Attorneys-General from the various States and the situation still exists where, because the Australian Constitution allows free trade between the States and Territories, the various States' legislation is overridden.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is certainly a need for national legislation in this regard and all the States support this approach. To substantiate the need for this legislation I will refer to both the findings of the 1989 International Crime Survey and evidence given to the Joint Select Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the release of the Trends and Issues Paper No.23, dated 23 June 1990, put out by the Australian Institute of Criminology entitled "A Comparison of Crime in Australia and Other Countries", the Australian Institute claimed that the statistics give, and I quote, "a result which must surely give cause for concern to all Australians and reinforce the need for the establishment of a National Crime Prevention Strategy". There are no suggestions in the paper as to what should constitute a National Crime Prevention Strategy and the Government has not taken up this suggestion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me come to the statistics that gave rise to this concern. The survey of a comparison of crime in Australia and other countries points out how difficult comparisons have been in the past, due to the variety and complexity of the criminal justice systems. However, it also points out that with the advent of standardised crime surveys and victimisation experiences, many of these dilemmas have been overcome. The Issues paper uses victim surveys. It summarises the findings of the 1989 International Crime Survey and says: " The Survey findings reveal that Australia has crime rates which are much more comparable to those of North America than Europe. In a number of cases these rates are the highest recorded among the 14 jurisdictions. I quote: "In assaults involving force, in the less serious types of sexual incidents, in burglary and in motor vehicle thefts, Australia ranked highest of all countries surveyed".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The paper suggests that some aspects of the Australian lifestyle may actually be responsible for our high crime rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What it attempted to point out is that our life style may, and it stresses may, contribute to the fact that Australia is ranked 3rd in the 14 countries surveyed in terms of overall victimisation behind USA and Canada. We rank highest in sexual incidents and 3rd in sexual assault, yet the paper ignores national characteristics&mdash;why?  We do know that other societies have different mores, eg. in Western Sumatra where women have always been respected and influential members of the community, anthropologists say rape is low or non-existent. The survey points out that some European countries such as Switzerland and England also rank very low in the more serious sexual assault rates, Switzerland having no incidents reported in 1988, and England 0.1% compared to Australia's 1.6% (201,147 incidents).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">May I suggest it is possible that the Australian characteristic of the macho chauvinist male has taught some of our men that being male gives them a right to dominate women, with masculinity meaning being aggressive both sexually and otherwise, and with their need for mate approval, may be and again I stress may, be the reason Australia ranks so high among those countries surveyed for sexual abuse. Another survey that reinforces my view, undertaken by the Office of the Status of Women, points out that 22% of men, an amazing one in 5 of our male population, believe it is acceptable for a man to use physical force against his wife. Surprisingly, 17% of women agree.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have already indicated, Australia tops the survey in sexual incidents against women and does so by quite a large margin. In Australia 7.3% of the sample were victimised in sexual incidents in 1988. The next country was the USA with 4.5%. The UK and France were amongst the lowest with 1.2%. As regards sexual assault, including rape, as I've said, Australia came 3rd; but by a much smaller margin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I've said, a Joint Select Committee of the Federal Parliament was required to enquire into video material and as I indicated there were 2 areas of particular concern to the Committee regarding content: firstly the strength of the violence in videos and secondly that "X" rated videos were degrading to women and should be abolished. Evidence supporting the concerns of the community was considerable. Dr Paul Wilson, formerly of the Institute of Criminology, gave evidence to our Committee, telling us that while he found no hard evidence that sadistic sexual pornography causes serial, lust, or child killing, he found evidence that in the killer's background there was, first of all, a preoccupation with this material, secondly, a feeling that their sexual and sadistic fantasies are fuelled by this material and, thirdly, a feeling in some cases that the material is not strong enough and that their fantasies are not satisfactorily fulfilled. He said that it was his view that with particular personalities, material of a sadistic, sexual kind which combines sex and violence reinforces existing predisposition towards the sadistic acts that are carried out and he was deeply concerned. He said: " my basic philosophical position has always been one of allowing adults to read or view what they want in private. However, I believe there is a strong case for censoring material which combines sex and sadism ". His concerns were supported by Dr William Belson's evidence. He was a prominent researcher on video violence. His study, "Television Violence and the Adolescent Boy" formed the basis of his evidence. He stated ". . . long term exposure to television violence increases boys' participation in violent behaviour, increases their preoccupation with violent acts shown on television, makes them more callous in their reactions to the spectacle of violence in the world around them. . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Patricia Edgar, Director of the Australian Children's Television Foundation, agreed. She sees it as `feasible' that some individuals may select materials that exaggerate their aggressive tendency and hence allow the committal of a violent crime, a crime that otherwise may not have occurred. Many more eminent academics and researchers gave similar evidence on violence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Professor James Check, who undertook research for the Fraser Committee on Pornography and Prostitution in Canada, found that the anti-social effects of pornography were the most pronounced in individuals who already possessed a certain `sexual aggressivity'. Moreover, the data  revealed that it was the frequent users of pornography who had the most striking inclinations to sexually aggressive behaviour. Again many eminent academics and researchers supported this view. Dr J.H. Court, of Kent Town, South Australia; Mr F.M. Horwill, of Victoria; Dr James Weaver, of Kentucky, USA; and Zillman and Bryant of London to name but a few. Others outside the Committee hearings included Scotland  Yard  and  many  Australian  Police Forces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evidence that made most sense to me was given by Professor Sheehan, University of Queensland. As with Dr. Wilson's evidence on violence, he too argued that the personality of the viewer was of prime importance, he said ". . . the critical thing in whether or not there will be these so-called effects of sexually explicit material is how aggressive the person is in the first place. . . .There is no question that a lot of people are stimulated mildly or strongly by seeing sexually explicit material. When one is aroused one tends to behave as a consequence of that arousal and I think if the person is aggressive, aggression will out . . . In and of itself, I do not think that sexually explicit material divorced from aggression leads to strong negative effects. Once you combine sexually explicit material with aggression you have a different kettle of fish. . . The critical thing is how much someone is aroused and how aggressive he is in the first place". If you consider this evidence in conjunction with the survey on domestic violence where nearly  1/4 of Australian men consider it acceptable to use physical force against their wives, then I believe we have a real problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The three main concerns of witnesses who opposed any censorship of either X-rated videos or violence in R-rated were that (1) `Adults should be able to view what they like and that censorship is a violation of civil rights'. I find it illogical that those who gave this type of evidence did not also object to censorship of child pornography. Again there is no proven evidence of a causative link between the viewing of child pornography and criminal child sexual abuse. Yet those who gave the Committee this evidence were all in favour of banning child pornography. It wasn't that they really objected to censorship, it's just where they wanted the line drawn. The next concern was `if banned, it would open up a black market'. Similarly those who made this claim didn't seem to think that just because there was a black market in child pornography, that type of censorship should be lifted. They agreed that, yes, a minority would continue to use the black market but you would not be able to walk down to the supermarket and get "the stuff"; use would certainly be greatly reduced. The third concern&mdash;`that there is no proven evidence of a causative link between the viewing of violent or non-violent pornography and violent criminal behaviour and so there is no justification  for its ban'. There is  evidence that convicted paedophiles have libraries of videos showing child pornography and there is evidence that many convicted murderers and rapists have libraries of X-rated and sexually violent R-rated videos, as Dr. Wilson said: "I have found evidence that in the killer's background there is, first of all, a preoccupation with this material".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no studies that give clear, proven evidence that the viewers of child pornography, violent pornography or non-violent pornography of itself causes criminal behaviour, but I do believe that there is a reasonable expectation that frequent viewing of any of these types of videos by people with aggressive characteristics can, as Professor Sheehan says, stimulate them mildly or strongly and they behave accordingly. As I have already pointed out, he is not alone in this belief. Substantial evidence was presented to us claiming viewing of such material desensitises the viewers, a claim we could all identify with. How often have we become desensitised to the use of unacceptable language or to the viewing of violence either in the news or in films. We all know that today, when we hear on the ABC certain expletives that were previously considered unacceptable, we no longer turn a hair. This is fact. Yet there seems to be a lack of acceptance of this fact by some people. They do not believe that regular viewing of pornography, and indeed sexual violence, so readily found in these videos, leads to the desensitisation of the viewer, even though so many experts have brought this evidence to the Senate Committee. Considering such doubt, I believe we must not allow, or even run the risk of allowing, these videos to desensitise our population. The cost is too great.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Supreme Court of NSW in May last year, when sentencing a young 19 year old man for the murder of a young mother, Justice Mathews, having given the history of the case and having accepted the evidence of both Dr Bruce Webster, a highly qualified psychiatrist for the defence and Dr Milton who gave evidence for the Crown, said: "It is not so easy to absolve a system which allows such a violent and unmeritorious film as "Nightmare at Shadow Woods" to be viewed indiscriminately by members of the community regardless of their underlying problems or susceptibilities. It was a film with no discernible artistic merit at all. As far as I could see it was nothing more than a vehicle for depicting gratuitous, mindless and ghoulish violence", the Judge said. She continued: " Dr Milton considered that the film acted as a trigger for the prisoner, transforming fantasies about violence into an intention to inflict actual violence. Dr Westmore also thought that the film acted as a trigger in that it was a disturbing agent in the prisoner's already disturbed brain. So that whichever version one were to accept, the viewing of this film had a real part to play in the tragedy which followed. Certainly the prisoner was already a vulnerable person, but it is precisely such a person which is likely to be adversely affected by watching such a film as this".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Judge went on: "I am not in a position to suggest any measures which might have been taken to prevent this tragedy, or which might be taken to prevent a similar one in the future. Clearly, a free and open society requires that there be freedom of communication. On the other hand, I cannot help wondering what benefits society can derive from having such a mindlessly violent film as this generally available to be viewed by anyone, no matter how disturbed he or she might be. The potentially devastating effects can be seen in the events of 27 February".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The video that triggered this horrendous crime was classified "M"&mdash;suitable for 15 years and over. In questioning the members of the office of Film and Literature Classification following the murder trial, I was informed the classification would not be altered. The government's guidelines made this video suitable for viewing by anyone over 15 years. I believe my Bill would alter that classification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A recent report was put out following research undertaken by Check and Sommers in Canada involving 44 women who suffered severe battering by their male partners. They were compared with a control group of women who had not been battered. It was found that the partners of the battered women were high consumers of pornography, in the form of both videos and magazines, while  the partners  of  the  control  group  were not.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is ironical that X-rated videos are considered by the Government too degrading to women to be shown in cinemas&mdash;they ban that&mdash;but they believe it's quite suitable for home entertainment, where, as we are fully aware, our young can and do, gain access to them. Could anyone be happy for their children to view X-rated videos as an introduction to their sex education? Does anyone believe this would contribute to a happy, healthy relationship in their future life?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is considerable concern in the community regarding the increase in the figures of sexual abuse&mdash;the latest figures on rape alone put out by the Institute show an increase of 159% in ten years. Every day we have newspaper articles reflecting the concerns of women in this country and the new ABC program "Without Consent", is just one of many responses to this growing concern in the community. Women are taking self defence courses, they talk about one-sex car-parking lots, they no longer go for walks in their neighbourhoods after dark. I know when doorknocking at election time, women will no longer open their doors even in the middle of the day, but wait until they establish who is knocking. On the last occasion when I introduced a similar Bill, every Women's organisation supported it. From the most conservative to the most radical&mdash;all pleaded with the Government to support my legislation. They were ignored. The Office of the Status of Women has put out a Position Paper to provide the basis for the work of the National Committee on Violence against Women. In it, they give examples of some of the more common types of sexual violence and they include " forcing her to view pornographic material". They say sexual violence is not only an attack on the woman's physical body it is also a violation experienced at emotional and intellectual levels. Dr. Wilson is quoted in the Daily Telegraph as saying "I think there's a view that pervades Australian culture that sex is readily available and if you can't get it you should take it". This view is reflected in the latest survey conducted this year by the Domestic Violence Resource Centre in Brisbane, which found 1 in 3 of the 14-15 year old boys surveyed, believed it was "okay" to rape a girl under certain circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I said in the beginning, the Institute of Criminology in its Trends and Issues paper "Comparing Crime in Australia and Other Countries" said the Survey's results "must surely give cause for concern to all Australians". Evidence given to our Committee underlined this concern and while I have only referred to one judgement, many judges throughout Australia have expressed similar concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As legislators I believe we must, we are required and it is our obligation to do everything in our power to make Australia a safer place for our women and men, and their families.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CORPORATE LAW REFORM BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill implements major reforms on directors' duties, related party transactions, corporate insolvency laws, and stock exchange settlement procedures. The Bill is the most significant piece of legislation, in terms of the content of Australia's corporate law, introduced during the life of this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial impact</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill is not expected to have any significant financial impact on Government. The Explanatory Memorandum details the potential impact of the Bill on business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The content of the Bill</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this is a long Bill because it has much to say.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the key areas of reform relates to directors' duties. On that matter, the Bill says that directors should be under an obligation to show the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person in their position would exercise. At the same time, the Bill and its supporting material make clear that the courts should never apply hindsight to the decisions of directors, but should judge those decisions based on the information which was available to the director at the time when the decision was made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also provides that where a director breaches his or her duty, but is not acting with any dishonest or fraudulent intent, the director should no longer be exposed to criminal sanctions and possible gaol terms. But it also says that shareholders should be protected against breaches by the substitution of appropriate civil penalties, including pecuniary penalties and disqualification in the case of serious breaches.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On related parties, the Bill will ensure that companies do not give benefits on less than commercial terms to directors or holding companies without shareholders having an opportunity to say whether the benefit should be given. It says that directors who have a material personal interest in a matter before the Board should disclose that interest and should be prevented from participating in Board consideration of that matter, unless their fellow directors are prepared to agree to them participating.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to companies in difficulty, the Bill makes plain that there are ways to deal with a company which is facing solvency difficulties that are more constructive and efficient than current remedies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will ensure that receivers are accountable to shareholders and creditors for what they are doing while controlling a company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It says that mortgagees should not be able to avoid being accountable by taking possession of an asset through an agent rather than appointing a receiver. The same accountability should apply whenever a mortgagee has taken over a company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Bill will prevent directors from avoiding liability for insolvent trading by deliberately refusing to take any part in the management of the company. It substitutes alternative defences which protect diligent and reasonable directors, without giving comfort to the reckless.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also enable directors who act honestly and reasonably to be absolved by a court from liability for insolvent trading. But such directors will also be specifically encouraged to take early action to tackle emerging difficulties, such as through the appointment of an administrator under the new voluntary administration procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Bill, liquidators will be able to more easily reverse transactions where companies have paid out monies to related parties just prior to a company's insolvency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This process will be assisted by ensuring that there are no technical restrictions on what a liquidator can examine in trying to ascertain what has actually happened with a company which has failed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also makes it clear that it is not good enough to provide for corporate law by making obscure and difficult cross-references to the Bankruptcy Act and substitutes clear provisions adapted specifically for companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Companies will no longer be able to resist statutory demands on purely technical grounds such as a minor misstatement of the quantity of a debt. Demands will be able to be set aside only where injustice would otherwise be caused.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also enable Australia's stock exchange settlement procedures to continue to remain on a par with the world's best and meet the standards of quick settlement that are nowadays demanded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And finally, the Bill will ensure that Australian and New Zealand accounting standards will as far as possible be brought into alignment, so that investors dealing with a company from the other country will be able to accurately assess the financial information with which they are provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The context of the Bill</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this Bill needs to be seen in the context of the Government's overall agenda for corporate law reform during the life of this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1990, the Parliament passed a Bill which established the national scheme for corporate regulation that we have enjoyed, for the first time in this country, since 1 January 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The next element in the Government's corporate law agenda was a series of shorter Bills, dealing with particularly urgent issues of reform, such as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-consolidation of accounts and the compulsory application of accounting standards;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-the implementation of the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on Insider Trading;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-measures to deal with the liquidity crisis which emerged in the unlisted property trust industry last year; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-measures to secure greater international co-operation in corporate law enforcement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill represents the next stage in the process of corporate law reform, a stage which involves tackling very significant and fundamental issues of reform in a number of different areas of corporate law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The history of the Bill</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These reforms have not emerged from a vacuum. On the contrary, as is the case with all of the Government's corporate law reform initiatives, the 4 main elements of this Bill have their origins either in a major law reform report or in calls by industry for the introduction of particular changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, the insolvency reforms in this Bill result from a report by the Australian Law Reform Commission. It is now some 9 years since the inquiry which led to that report commenced. The Commission first published an issues paper and received submissions on it. This was followed by the publication of a 351-page discussion paper (which generated some 204 more detailed submissions), and a 620-page report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also includes provisions which implement the report by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs on the "Social and Fiduciary Duties and Obligations of Company Directors". That report itself followed the receipt of many submissions by the Committee and public hearings in a number of cities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The related party transactions provisions in the Bill result from a report by the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee, which followed a 2-year period of public consultation, with the public release of first a report and then a draft Bill. When the Corporate Law Reform Bill was released for public exposure in February this year, the provisions in this Part of the Bill were criticised on the basis that they were too long and complex and failed to give the kind of clear guidance in this area which seemed necessary following the many disastrous related party transactions which took place in the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to those concerns, the Government has arranged for the provisions to be redrafted in a simpler form&mdash;one which focuses much more directly on the general principles involved, supports those principles by examples where appropriate, and eschews any attempt to provide by long "black letter" formulations a precise description of how the law should apply in every particular case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Stock Exchange settlement reforms in the Bill result from recommendations of a high level clearing and settlement steering committee established by the Australian Stock Exchange to look at implementation of a report by "The Group of 30" (a private international organisation concerned with major economic and financial issues). These reforms will enable the Australian Stock Exchange to keep up with world best practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As is appropriate for a Bill of its significance, unprecedented consultation has been associated with every aspect of the development of the Bill, and major efforts have been made to as far as possible meet all the concerns which have been raised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even before the Bill was drafted, the Attorney-General's Department circulated discussion papers to interested peak organisations and professional bodies for the purpose of testing their reaction to the general approach which might be taken in the Bill. After the Bill was released for public exposure in February of this year, this consultation process intensified. The Department and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee jointly sponsored a series of practitioners' forums on the Bill, each of which was attended by a large number of business and professional people. The Joint Parliamentary Committee for Corporations and Securities held hearings in a number of cities. The Attorney-General has spoken at a number of seminars and other gatherings organised to consider the Bill, and officers from the Department have attended as many as possible of the many professional seminars which have considered the Bill during the year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over 200 submissions were received on the Bill and these have been carefully analysed, and many changes have been made to the Bill that was exposed. The Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill outlines the more significant changes that have been made. There have also been many minor technical improvements, which have resulted from the welcome willingness of many within the business and professional communities to involve themselves in a consultation process. It is a process that has been far more thorough than has ever taken place before in Australian corporate law, and, I dare say, is one of the most thorough processes of consultation that has ever taken place on any Bill in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Main features of the Bill</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now want to outline a few of the most important features of the Bill. A more detailed survey is set out at the start of the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">- directors' duties</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill amends subsection 232(4) of the Corporations Law to reinforce that an officer's duty of care is an objective one, requiring the officer to exercise the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person in a like position as an officer of a corporation would exercise in the corporation's circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of a business corporation, the proposed standard will reflect the fact that corporate decisions involve risk-taking. The courts have in the past recognised that directors and officers are not liable for honest errors of judgement. They have also shown a reluctance to review business judgments taken in good faith. Thus, in Harlowe's Nominees Pty. Limited v Woodside 121 CLR 483 at 493, the High Court said:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Directors in whom are vested the right and duty of deciding where the company's interests lie and how they are to be served may be concerned with a wide range of practical considerations, and their judgment, if exercised in good faith and not for irrelevant purposes, is not open to review in the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the courts have exercised their discretion to excuse directors who have acted honestly and who ought fairly to be excused. The Corporations Law already contains a provision of this nature (section 1318), and the application of that section is effectively being extended by clause 17 of this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government endorses this approach and does not intend any change in the law by the revised wording of subsection 232(4). No attempt has been made in the Bill to enact a U.S. style of Business Judgment Rule since no state in the USA has adopted a legislative statement of the Rule. Instead the matter has been left to the courts to develop. Similarly the Government considers that the development of similar principles in Australia is better left to the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also decriminalises certain key directors' duties provisions by providing that breaches of those provisions are no longer subject to criminal sanctions unless the breaches are committed with a dishonest intent. In the course of a planned general review of the penalty provisions in the Corporations Law, the Government will be considering carefully the extent to which the decriminalisation initiatives in this Bill should be taken further.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Civil penalties are substituted in respect of breaches which are committed without a dishonest intent. The Bill provides that a pecuniary penalty of up to $200,000 may be imposed. However, no pecuniary penalty may be imposed unless the Court considers that the breach is a serious one. The Bill also allows the Court to disqualify a director. However, the Court may only do so where it concludes that the director is not a fit and proper person to manage a corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">- related party transactions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps the most important provisions in the Bill are the provisions which deal with related party transactions, such as loans to directors and loans between companies in a group.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Corporations Law is currently almost silent on related party transactions. Certainly, the general duties and fiduciary principles which are reflected in some of the more general provisions in the Law do have relevance in this area. There is also a complex and rather outdated provision which deals with three types of benefits which can be given to directors. But there is nothing which sets out clearly, and in a coherent fashion, what this Parliament has to say on the matter generally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, there is nothing in the Corporations Law which says specifically that money should not be given to holding companies without minority shareholders having an opportunity to consider the transaction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is nothing in the Corporations Law which says specifically that remuneration for directors must not be unreasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is nothing in the Corporations Law that says specifically that directors cannot act in concert with others to pillage a company's resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In all of these respects, areas where investors in so many Australian companies have suffered so badly in recent years, the Corporations Law is currently silent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill fills that void. It will represent this Parliament's view about what ought to have happened in all those cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It does so in a reasoned and principled way. It does not seek to deal with every conceivable situation and to provide a specific rule for that situation. Many feel that that kind of approach only encourages the search for loopholes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Equally, the Bill does not impose undue compliance costs. Generous exceptions are allowed to the rules in the Bill, and even where the policy of the Bill dictates that a shareholder meeting should be held to approve a particular transaction or type of transaction, the Bill is concerned to ensure that those meetings can be held in a manner that is as inexpensive as possible, yet still consistent with the need to ensure that shareholders are fully informed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">- insolvency reforms</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, in relation to the multi-faceted insolvency reforms, special mention should be made of those relating to companies in financial difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is often said of our insolvency laws that they are so inflexible and expensive to use that it is impossible for a company to seek to recover through an insolvency administration without facing the likelihood of liquidation. This is because most current forms of administration suffer from the fatal flaw that individual creditors can disrupt them to the point where they become unworkable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is really needed, when a basically sound company faces solvency difficulties, is a capacity for that company to obtain a breather. This Bill offers that opportunity. Directors will be able to appoint an administrator, who will have the benefit of a moratorium on actions against the company while formulating a plan of action for consideration by the creditors. The emphasis is on informality and flexibility. The emphasis is also on speed of action. The procedure does not allow the indefinite administrations which can occur, for example, under the United States Chapter 11 approach. The emphasis is also on appropriate protection of creditors' interests, so that they will find that they are not unduly disadvantaged by the short moratorium proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been suggested that, in addition to the new voluntary scheme of administration, consideration should also be given to a form of insolvency administration that can be readily invoked by unsecured creditors. That is something the Attorney-General has some sympathy for, and will examine in the light of the experience with the voluntary scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What comes after the Bill</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, Mr Speaker, a word about the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Attorney-General has indicated on previous occasions, this Bill, and the proposed Enhanced Statutory Disclosure Bill, will bring to completion a stage of the Government's corporate law program which has been concerned to redress deficiencies in the law which were exposed by the problems of the late 1980s. During this stage of that program, the Government has addressed issues such as the lack of guidance in the law on related party transactions, the lack of rigour in application of accounting standards, the lack of on-going disclosure by listed companies, and inflexibility in our insolvency laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But we also need to look forward and to build on the achievements attained during the life of this Parliament. In particular, we need to forge the odd mix of corporate laws that we have inherited from the co-operative scheme into a streamlined engine for economic progress and development. We need to give Australian business the kind of corporate law that it will need for the twenty-first century.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some months ago, the Attorney-General said that he would be looking to commence a process of simplifying and modernising our corporate law as soon as the current Bills were finalised. That next stage of the Government's corporate law program is about to commence. I know that there are many elements of the business and professional community that are eager to get started. I know, from experience this year, that they will make valuable contributions. And they know, also from experience this year, that the Government will involve them very closely in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, in accordance with the Heads of Agreement between the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory on corporate regulation, the Ministerial Council for Corporations has been consulted on the Bill and has approved its introduction into Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill and I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (CAR PARKING) BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will give effect to the Budget measure announced on 18 August 1992 to tax certain car parking benefits. The Government finds it inequitable that some employees receive these car parking benefits in a tax exempt form while other employees, most of whom will not get a tax deduction for their car parking costs, must pay for equivalent facilities out of their after tax income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the Bill will amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 to impose fringe benefits tax on certain car parking benefits received by employees. However, a benefit will only arise where a car used to commute from home to work is parked at or near the employee's main workplace for more than 4 hours between the hours of 7.00 a.m. and 7.00 p.m.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where the employer reimburses an employee's car parking expenses, the value of the benefit will be the amount of that reimbursement. Where the employer provides car parking facilities to an employee, the value of the benefit will be determined in accordance with the mechanism set out in the budget papers. That is, the value of the lowest cost all-day parking at a permanent commercial parking station available to the public within one kilometre of the employer-provided facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to deny to employees a deduction for similar car parking expenses which arise from parking a car used to commute to work at or near the employee's main workplace for more than 4 hours between the hours of 7.00 a.m. and 7.00 p.m. This denial of a deduction will ensure that the overall tax effect of providing either a car parking benefit or an allowance to an employee to cover car parking expenses is substantially similar.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To minimise concerns about any unintended impact of these measures, the Government has ensured that the Bill provides that the provision of certain parking facilities can be exempted by Regulation. Such exemptions may include parking facilities provided by employers that are of a minimal value or parking facilities which would not normally be considered to be "commercial parking stations" for the purpose of these measures. The Government will consider the circumstances under which it would be appropriate for it to recommend to the Governor-General to make such Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures introduced in this Bill will result in an increase to revenue of $90m in 1993-94, $253m in 1994-95 and $203m in each subsequent year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to give employers and car parking operators sufficient time to adjust their procedures as a result of this Bill, and so that the Government can consider what Regulations may be required, the provisions of this Bill will not apply until 1 July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum which contains more detailed explanation of the provisions of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is an omnibus measure proposing amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Customs Administration Act 1985. The main proposals contained in the Bill relate to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Customs Administration Act 1985 to provide the legislative framework for the electronic transmission to Customs of information relating to the reporting, screening and clearance of cargo, and to permit limited on-line computer access to such information by other specified agencies;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) amendments to the Customs Act 1901 to improve waterfront security in accordance with recommendations of the Joint Review Committee of the National Crime Authority;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) amendments to the Customs Act 1901 to extend eligibility for the diesel fuel rebate scheme to vessels servicing oil and gas operations in the North West Shelf and Timor Gap exploration areas when those vessels travel to and from Australian ship repair yards for repairs or refits; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) amendments to the Customs Act 1901 to effect minor technical changes consequential on the introduction of the electronic lodgement reforms to the import entry regime in Act No. 34 of 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now refer briefly to each of those proposals:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Cargo Automation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments in Clauses 6, 7 and 10 of the Bill are a response to the increasing role that electronic data interchange plays in international trade. The Australian Customs Service is continuing to play an important role in the development of electronic initiatives to keep pace with EDI changes in international trade communications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed cargo automation scheme introduced by this Bill is the third leg of the improvement and updating of Customs entry facilities for imports and exports, and is modelled on the two earlier initiatives passed unanimously by this Parliament in Act No. 111 of 1990 (for exported goods), and in Act No. 34 of 1992 (for imported goods).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similar to the two previous electronic schemes, the cargo automation system will operate on the basis of legislative amendments and contractual arrangements between Customs and users of the system. The proposed amendments in this Bill introduce an electronic/computer option for the communication</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to Customs of information concerning cargo, to complement the current documentary/manual cargo reporting facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cargo automation system will allow airlines, shipping companies and freight forwarders to give Customs reports of the cargo intended to be discharged at Australian ports in advance of the arrival of that cargo. Those details will enable the cargo to be effectively screened against various profiles; for example, those relating to prohibited imports. The profiles can be altered by Customs at any time to target specific types of goods or destinations and can be further refined on the basis of intelligence and data relating to import practices. The advantage of an automated system is of course the speed with which it reacts to changing information, so that effective risk assessment and risk management is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the amendments proposed in Clause 27 of the Bill, Port authorities will be provided with access to these cargo report details to facilitate the gathering of statistics and the calculation of wharfage charges, whilst the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service will be provided with access to the cargo reports for the purposes of facilitating the detection of possible breaches of the Quarantine Act 1908.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new cargo automation system proposed in this Bill introduces considerable benefits for all parties involved in the entry and clearance of cargo; not the least of which are the significant reductions in paperwork and the more speedy access to information, on the one hand, whilst, on the other, it will provide a major enhancement of Customs ability to speedily screen reports for correct details against various risk profiles and provide a more effective control over landed cargo and its subsequent movement under Customs control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Waterfront Security</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments contained in Clauses 5 and 23 of the Bill are intended to improve waterfront security by obliging persons in `Customs areas' to produce satisfactory identification upon request by a Customs officer and by strengthening the powers of Customs officers to stop and search vehicles in certain circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments are designed to overcome weaknesses in the present system which were highlighted by the National Crime Authority in its 1989 report on `Port Security'; in particular, problems faced by law enforcement agencies in their attempts to inhibit the flow of illegal drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Review Committee established to examine the National Crime Authority recommendations had noted that the inability to control or identify wharf visitors and waterfront workers was hindering barrier enforcement. The present amendments squarely address that issue, and are discussed in greater detail in the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Diesel Fuel Rebate</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments relating to the diesel fuel rebate scheme (DFRS) contained in Clause 21 of the Bill extend the eligibility criteria of the scheme, with effect from the Government's 18 August 1992 Budget decision to allow certain ships to claim a rebate on diesel-fuel used while travelling to and from Australian ports for repairs or refits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ships concerned are those engaged in the servicing of the oil and gas operations off the Western Australian coast, including the North West Shelf and Timor Gap areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently these servicing ships have an option to have repairs or refits undertaken either in Australian or Singaporean ship repair yards. Diesel fuel taken on by the ships in Singapore is at the international price, which does not include Australian excise. This has resulted in Australian ship repair yards being placed at a competitive disadvantage, especially those in Western Australia which are almost equidistant from the repair yards in Singapore.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments will effectively remove this disadvantage by reducing the cost of the Australian diesel fuel for those ships travelling to Australian ports for the necessary repairs or refits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Other Amendments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the amendments outlined above, the Bill proposes a number of minor amendments to the electronic lodgement provisions of the Customs Act 1901, which were introduced last Sittings by Act No. 34 of 1992. These amendments are explained in greater detail in the Explanatory Memorandum's Clause Notes for Clauses 11,12,19,20 and 22.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures contained in this Bill relating to the proposed cargo automation reforms, and the extension of the diesel fuel rebate scheme, are expected to result in additional costs, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) Cargo automation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost of implementation, including development, maintenance, and operational costs, have been estimated in present dollar values, as,</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> $0.25m for each full year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other proposed amendments in this Bill have no direct financial implications.</PARA>

This Bill provides the mechanism for the determination of interim and final duties, as well as introducing the two means by which subsequent adjustments of duty liability can be effected.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In broad terms the present legislation imposes a dumping duty which represents the difference between the export price and the normal value of the goods, or where the Minister so directs, a lesser amount sufficient to remove the injury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the present regime, duty is not payable where the dumping margin is purportedly eliminated by raising the actual export price to the level of the normal value determined at the inquiry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals put forward in this package provide a mechanism whereby an interim duty will be imposed on each importation of goods subject to anti-dumping or countervailing measures.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the introduction of an interim duty system in the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Bill, this Bill proposes two means by which subsequent adjustments of duty liability can be effected.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill proposes to amend the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 as the second Bill of the legislative package to introduce a new system for dumping and countervailing duties. This Bill introduces the new taxing regime for the imposition and collection of both interim and final dumping and countervailing duties, while the other Bill in the package which I have just introduced, the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Bill, provides the mechanism for the determination of interim and final duties, as well as introducing the two means by which subsequent adjustments of duty liability can be effected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I noted in the second reading speech for the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Bill, interim dumping duty imposed under this Bill will be based initially on the difference between the normal value and the export price as determined by the inquiries. Important additional features of the new regime are that the Minister will be able to determine the duty on an ad valorem or specific rate basis, and, where the export price falls below the export price ascertained by the inquiry, the difference between these prices will also be collected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Interim countervailing duty will be imposed on the basis of the amount of the subsidy identified by the inquiries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In either case, and consistent with Australia's obligations as a signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the GATT), the Minister will continue to consider the desirability of imposing a lesser rate of duty where this is sufficient to remove injury.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate and present its explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">QANTAS SALE BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, the proposed sale of Qantas Airways Limited is an important part of the Government's extensive program of reform of the Australian aviation industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1988 on, the Boards of Directors for both Qantas and Australian Airlines had repeatedly raised with the Government the question of their being given greater access to equity capital. The airlines were weighed down by grossly un-commercial debt to equity ratios at a time of rapid business expansion. The Government therefore had to face up directly to the question of whether or not to invest a large amount of funds in the airlines and, if so, to then forgo expenditure in other higher priority areas as a consequence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Faced with this choice, the Government decided in September 1990 to sell 100 per cent of Australian Airlines and 49 per cent of Qantas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In doing so, the Government recognised that, in the particular circumstances prevailing in the aviation industry, much of the benefits that are thought to come from public ownership in the sector could still be achieved under private ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shortly after that decision was taken, the Government introduced the successful de-regulation of domestic aviation, which has seen unprecedented numbers of people flying at markedly reduced fares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a detailed `scoping study' of the various sales options open to it, the Government announced in April 1991 that the sale of each of Qantas and Australian Airlines would proceed on the basis of an initial `trade sale' process&mdash;thereby offering large prospective purchasers the chance to acquire a significant equity interest in either or both airlines, at a premium&mdash;followed by a public float to sell any remaining equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the respective sales processes, both airlines would be appropriately recapitalised and suitable employee share ownership schemes would also be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, in the `One Nation' Statement made to Parliament by the Prime Minister on 26 February 1992, further far-reaching aviation reforms were announced. The Statement established the framework and timetable for removing the barriers between Australia's domestic and international aviation sectors, permitting multiple designation of Australia's international air services, and for developing a single aviation market with New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale process involved submission of expressions of interest from prospective trade buyers, with indicative non-binding bids. From this it became clear that a number of prospective purchasers, as well as Qantas and Australian Airlines themselves, believed that substantial synergistic benefits and operational efficiency gains could be achieved if Qantas and Australian Airlines were to be combined into a single entity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, on 2 June 1992 the Government announced that Qantas would be permitted to acquire Australian Airlines for $400m, thus providing the best mechanism for quickly achieving the synergistic benefits offered by a link-up between the two airlines, to the overall financial advantage of taxpayers generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government also announced then that 100 per cent of the expanded Qantas Group would be sold&mdash;rather than 49 per cent, as originally decided&mdash;with the community's interests being protected by a number of national interest safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The artificial distinction between domestic and international aviation has largely been broken down. At the same time, Qantas has acquired a local aviation network and secured a strong domestic base for its international operations in future through the acquisition of Australian Airlines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill now before the House contains the legislative changes that need to be made to enable the sale of Qantas to be finalised, taking into account all possible outcomes, including the fact that varying levels of ownership could be sold during the current `trade sale' process prior to the ensuing public float next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also reflects key sale requirements relating to the national interest safeguards required with the sale of 100 per cent of Qantas, the recapitalisation of Qantas, the reconstruction of its debts in preparation for the impending change of ownership and the terms and conditions of employment for its staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vast bulk of the Bill is concerned with the removal of both airlines from the ambit of a variety of Commonwealth legislation so that, post sale, the expanded Qantas Group will be treated the same as other private sector enterprises generally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National Interest Safeguards</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamentals of the national interest safeguards, referred to earlier, need to be enshrined in legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These safeguards are important to maintain the basic Australian character of Qantas as well as to ensure that Qantas' operating rights under Australia's various bilateral air service agreements and arrangements with other countries are not put under threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once in legislation, these safeguards will not be subject to the whim of the Government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus, the Bill requires that Qantas' Articles of Association must contain provisions which will ensure that: Qantas' main operational base and headquarters remain in Australia; that the name of `Qantas' is preserved for the company's scheduled international passenger services; that the company be incorporated in Australia; that at least two-thirds of the Board of Qantas be Australian citizens; that the Chairman of the Board also be an Australian citizen;  and, in particular, that total foreign ownership is not to exceed 35 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will also require Qantas' Articles to specify that no single foreign interest can exceed 25 per cent of the equity of Qantas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Qantas' Articles will be required to provide Directors with wide powers to act, including to deny registration or to force the disposal of shares held by foreigners, to ensure the 35 per cent foreign ownership limit and the 25 per cent limit on single foreign interests are not breached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill requires that a restriction apply to any `block' shareholdings of foreigners representing more than 15 per cent of the voting shares in Qantas. All such foreign block holdings, either individually or in aggregate, will not be able to vote on more than one-third of Board members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Directors of Qantas have a clear commercial incentive, as well as a moral and legal duty, to adhere to the specific new Articles that the Bill requires. The Bill ensures that any attempt by shareholders to change the Articles required by the Bill can not have any effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, specific provision is made in the Bill for the Minister for Transport and Communications to monitor the level of foreign ownership and control of Qantas in future&mdash;and to take appropriate legal action in the event that the stipulated national interest safeguards are breached or seem likely to be breached.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Debt and Capital Reconstruction</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with the rationale for the sale of Qantas, the Bill provides the basis for the recapitalisation of Qantas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that the Government intends to remove the substantial amount of Commonwealth-guaranteed debt in Qantas' existing debt portfolio, prior to sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the important question of principle involved,  the Commonwealth cannot countenance the possibility of it still being potentially liable for over a billion dollars of Qantas' debt once control of the airline shifts to the private sector. This would be tantamount to the Commonwealth retaining a major stake in the company despite its 100 per cent sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only a small amount of the Commonwealth-guaranteed debt is able to be paid out up-front because it is in the form of widely held bearer bonds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus, the Bill allows the Commonwealth to assume the obligations and to make all the necessary payments, including the payment of interest and the repayment of principal, associated with this debt as they become due and payable. It also appropriates the funds required to meet these obligations. At current exchange rates, the face value of the Commonwealth-guaranteed debt is about $1.1 billion and the associated interest payments total about $500m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Qantas will pay the Commonwealth to assume this debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To enable Qantas to do this, the Bill provides sufficient appropriation for Qantas to receive a subscription to share capital from the Commonwealth of an amount at least equal to the face value of the debt to be taken over by the Government, at the exchange rates prevailing at the time of the debt assumption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the Bill provides for a total appropriation of up to $1.4 billion to cover possible subscriptions to Qantas' share capital in order to allow for adverse movements in exchange rates between now and the time of assumption of the Commonwealth-guaranteed debt. It also provides scope for a separate share subscription to be made to Qantas for recapitalisation purposes should that be needed. This could conceivably involve discharging other Qantas debt as part of debt restructuring prior to sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Short-term Commonwealth guarantees are also allowed for in the Bill to cover possible contingencies, particularly in relation to the re-financing of the short term commercial paper program of Australian Airlines prior to a 100 per cent sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for a debt assumption of up to $300 million should it be considered necessary or desirable to neutralise any effect of the debt restructuring on the profit and loss account. This will cover the `worst case' scenario. At current exchange rates, the net loss to Qantas' profit and loss account would be less than $100m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that the takeover of some of Qantas' debts by the Commonwealth&mdash;including any payment made to neutralise an undue effect on Qantas' profit and loss account&mdash;would result in an excessive recapitalisation of Qantas, a special `one-off' dividend payment or a refund of capital to the Commonwealth could be sought from Qantas before the sale is finalised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alternatively, if the net recapitalisation effect of the debt assumption by the Commonwealth is not sufficient, new Qantas shares could be sold (along with the Commonwealth's existing shares) or the general share subscription provisions in the Bill could be used to meet this need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to emphasise that any recapitalisation of Qantas that is effected by the Government during the sale process will be fully recouped in increased proceeds from the sale of the Commonwealth's equity in Qantas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will, therefore, be no net impact on the Budget from these debt and recapitalisation provisions over time.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is committed to the protection of all airline employees' rights which accrue during the period of Government ownership, especially in cases where these rights accrue as a result of Commonwealth legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this end, the Bill provides for a number of "savings" provisions in respect of a variety of Acts, such as the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act and the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation (CERC) Act. These provisions will ensure, in particular, that employees of Australian Airlines do not lose the benefits that they will have accrued prior to the sale of at least 50 per cent of Qantas.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the Government's commitment that Qantas should operate within a fully commercial environment as soon as possible, the airline is to be freed from all legislative constraints which apply generally to Commonwealth business enterprises, once a sufficient amount of equity in Qantas has been sold. Provisions for this are largely contained in the Schedule to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employee-related legislation aside, the proclamation to effect the cessation of such legislation will be made when sufficient equity in Qantas has been sold.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members should not be concerned on public accountability grounds at the prospect of the Commonwealth being in the position after the trade sale of retaining a majority shareholding in Qantas (pending the ensuing public float) but having removed most of the Government administrative controls and legislative provisions currently applying to Qantas as a Commonwealth Government business enterprise. For so long as the Government retains a majority shareholding in Qantas, it will require specific articles to be included in Qantas' articles of association in order to discharge its responsibility to the Australian public for its continuing, but transitory, majority ownership of Qantas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government would in any event have the reserve power, which would only be exercised in very limited circumstances in the transitional period prior to full sale of using an ordinary resolution at a general meeting to protect the community's investment in Qantas in the lead-up to full sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Stamp Duty Exemptions</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale of Qantas and, in particular, the anticipated public float could leave purchasers of equity in Qantas liable for certain State and Territory taxes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we concluded last night we were looking at the use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. We had discussed the question of the availability of information in relation to the payments to State governments particularly, either through the Advance to the Minister for Finance or in other ways, which have not been necessarily used for that purpose. Overnight I have had the opportunity to refresh my mind on some of the points that were raised on this matter during the Estimates hearing debate on 22 September, at pages 131 and 132 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I want to revisit that briefly, in particular the discussion that was initiated on page 131. I raised the issue of the payment from the Advance to the Minister for Finance in August of this year&mdash;just a couple of months ago&mdash;of an amount of $17m to the Government of South Australia for public sector reform. I asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why was that payment not announced and funded at the time of the Premiers Conference?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Pearson, from the Department, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That decision on the AMF was taken by the Minister for Finance so I might refer to that.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator McMullan said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the normal processes were gone through by the Treasurer and the Department of the Treasury, and then the Treasurer to the Minister, for approval of this. It was considered by both Ministers, particularly the Minister for Finance who made the final decision, to meet the criteria and so it was approved.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the criteria of the payment being urgent and unforeseen. I raised the point that, according to the documents that were tabled with the Advance to the Minister for Finance for August, that decision was taken in the context of the Premiers Conference of 12 June. I made the point that I found it difficult to understand why that was an urgent and unforeseen payment coming up in August and should it not have been included in the normal Appropriations and dealt with in the normal way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan might recall saying that, as he was advised, the agreement was made in June, after the Supply Bill was finalised. That was correct; I agreed with that. Perhaps Senator McMullan had not been fully informed at that stage, but he said that it was his understanding that the agreement would be paid in the financial year 1991-92 and therefore to implement the agreement it had to be paid in that year. I then pointed out that the payment was not made in 1991-92; it was made in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did not properly revisit that issue, in my view. In the light of the time that has elapsed since then, has the Parliamentary Secretary been able to have another look at that and answer the question I posed at that time: namely, why was it necessary to use this procedure to pay from the Advance to the Minister for Finance during the month of August, that is in 1992-93, several months after the initial decision was apparently taken in the context of the Loan Council? I would appreciate any further comments he might be able to add to that matter. </PARA>

My understanding is that there has been no public announcement of that payment; I may be incorrect, but perhaps the honourable senator could direct me to where such a public announcement has been made&mdash;if it has&mdash;other than its being contained in the Budget Papers and buried with everything else.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So there was no separate announcement of this payment. From what Senator McMullan is saying, I assume that one would have to look at the Budget Papers in detail or one would have to look at what for most people is a totally arcane document&mdash;the Advance to the Minister for Finance&mdash;and its surrounding documents. They do happen to get tabled in here but without any public coverage, other than people commenting on them as they wish when they are tabled. They are very poor substitutes, I would have thought, for public announcements of decisions of this nature involving taxpayers' money.

I wonder whether Senator McMullan feels that the procedures for the public disclosure of payments of this nature and, more generally, the use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance are sufficient to ensure that there is adequate public knowledge of decisions that are taken by the Government in these areas. We are, of course, talking about the use of taxpayers' funds, often a very considerable use. This one happened to be $17m; to most people that is a lot of money but there are many other decisions which are much larger than that. Is there the need or scope for a greater disclosure and, therefore, greater public accountability of the use of the AMF for these purposes? Is there the need or scope for making the public more aware of decisions of government of this nature?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a fairly categoric answer. I just have to say that in my view and in the view of the coalition it certainly is not adequate. There ought to be much greater accountability and public disclosure of the use of public funds for this matter. I would just put it on the record that there is a major disagreement between us on the need for accountability and public awareness in the use of government funds. Perhaps if there were a greater accountability we would not have seen the deals and other matters of a financial nature over recent years that have caused so much concern to the general community and to financial markets generally. That is an issue which will be taken up in other places and perhaps taken up here later today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I direct Senator McMullan's attention to paragraphs 41 and 42 on pages 7 and 8 of the Committee's report. Paragraph 41 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee raised the issue of AMF payments described as being for particular State purposes but actually being used for different purposes. The Department confirmed that there were cases documented over a number of years of this practice which it regarded as not a practice that either the Commonwealth or States would normally countenance.</PARA>
<PARA>We had some discussion on that yesterday. Paragraph 41 continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It indicated that the whole nature of accountability and responsibility was to ensure that the moneys appropriated for particular programs were spent on those programs. That provides the basis on which any subsequent evaluation or assessment of how well the program had performed would be based.</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 42 reads in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When questioned as to what sanctions could be taken, the Committee was informed that if there was an indication that moneys for particular purposes were not being spent, the relevant Minister would normally be advised when that information became available.</PARA>
<PARA>As I understand it from yesterday's discussion here, an inquiry has been made of the States, initiated by the Department of Finance, as a result of the discussions we had in the Estimates Committee on 22 September. I sought advice about such payments that might have been made and used for other purposes. I was told yesterday that letters had gone to the States but that insufficient responses had yet been received to give me an adequate reply, although some response might be coming today. I ask, first of all, whether any of that information is available as of this morning. I know that Senator Button gave himself scope to provide that information this afternoon, but is any of that information available yet?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously, I am at some disadvantage about yesterday's discussion, because I was not here. My advice is that the information Senator Button indicated he would get related to expenditures under the Supply Bills rather than to this particular matter, but that there has been some action taken through the relevant Commonwealth departments seeking information to confirm that expenditures made under grants to the States have been spent in accordance with the Commonwealth's requirements. It will not be an easy process to get all that information together, but that process is under way, as I understand it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this relates to one of the two outstanding questions on which I am seeking information, but let me just confirm that. The Department of Finance at the moment is doing a hunt to find examples, if any, going back over the last 10 or 20 years, of situations where payments made by the Commonwealth for one purpose, ostensibly, have been used for others. I am told that there are no examples at the moment and that is what we are waiting for because it is going to take time.

Is the Minister saying that there are no such examples of a Minister having been advised when information indicating a misspending or a changed spending of these funds has become available?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I may have had a bad night or something, but I have to say that I do not understand the logic that has been pursued through that rather tortuous question. I would like to make two points which I think respond to what the essence of it is. Firstly, there is nothing peculiar to the AMF in this method of establishing whether the money has been spent in accordance with the Commonwealth's requirements. What we are talking about would apply equally whether the money were provided under the AMF or otherwise; there is nothing magical about that. I say this just in case there was some misunderstanding about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is apparently&mdash;and, I think, understandably&mdash;no central register that says, `This is an example of all of the occasions on which a certain procedure has been undertaken or this particular problem has arisen'. There certainly is not in the Department of Finance. As one thinks about the normal nature of administration, it would be likely that any department would have information about road grants programs or about local government programs, rather than information centrally coordinated on the basis of whether the State spent the money as required by the Commonwealth or not. That would not be a normal administrative record keeping category that one would envisage departments having. So they would have to assess those various programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not understand why Senator Short thinks it is unusual that one could say, `This is what the normal process would be for dealing with the problem, even if the problem has not arisen'. That is a fairly normal process of having decision making and administrative processes in place: `This is how one would deal with this problem if it arose'. </PARA>

We are still in the dark as to why those Supply Bills were actually required. One of the ways of taking us out of the dark on that would be for us to have more information than is available now on how far the existing Supply will carry the Government.

What Senator McMullan has said in response to other questions this morning does not lead me to any conclusion that the Budget figures are sufficiently off target to imply that the 3 December payday could not be met. So my conclusion from Senator McMullan's comments to us this morning, for which I thank him, is that the passage of Supply would cover beyond the payday of 3 December. From his previous comments, he is not going to comment any further on that. That seems to me to be the inescapable conclusion from the comments he has made. I thank him for them.</PARA></TALK.START>

Prior to making that comment, in view of the comments Senator McMullan made about Sir John Kerr, I would like to say that the views that Senator McMullan and some of his colleagues have on Sir John Kerr are certainly not shared on this side of the chamber. I personally regard Sir John Kerr as a very great Australian and I have the greatest confidence that history will record and mark the courage of this great Australian, Sir John Kerr. I am sorry the persecution of Sir John Kerr has continued on some 17 years,  even after his death. I think it is a very sad thing that a man who acted in good faith, who did what he saw to be his duty, should have been subjected to such constant and unceasing attacks. Senator McMullan is a man who at times has shown he can rise above the party line. I think it is a pity that he has stooped to take a cheap shot at a man whom I regard as a very great Australian. I wish to record that in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I am sorry it was raised by Senator McMullan, particularly in view of the current issue on loans affairs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following on from Senator Kemp's reservation, I would like to ask a couple of questions of my own on local government capital works. The sort of reply that Senator McMullan has been giving to Senator Kemp is the standard reply one gets from a hospital when one rings up to see how someone is going. One is told, `As well as can be expected'. I refer to the allocations for local government capital works in Western Australia. I would like to know&mdash;because, after all, the Department of Finance holds the key to the bank in the final analysis&mdash;how the programs are going. Are they all going fairly evenly? For instance, there is finance allocated to the city of Stirling&mdash;an effort to save the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives. The allocations to local government there were made in direct proportion to the margin that Labor members held. Is the finance flowing to those projects evenly, or is it accelerated&mdash;for want of a better word&mdash;in places like the city of Stirling?</PARA></TALK.START>

If my recollection is correct, there are then two other payments during the course of the project. I do not have immediately available to me information about what triggers from the Office of Local Government an indication that the subsequent stages of payments under the contracts are appropriate to be paid. It would have some internal procedure for doing that. I do not have it immediately available to me. But there is a series of payments. It is not all paid at the end.

Some would require legislation; some would not. It depends upon the terms of the original appropriation and the terms of the legislation which underpins the purpose for which the moneys were to be transferred.

The Government seems now to be in a massive panic mode because it has not been able to get its projects for major rail funding off the ground. As I understand it, there has not been one new job created as a result of these much vaunted, but never on, One Nation statements. Instead, the Government is proposing, apparently, to divert funds from those earlier announced projects into quick-fix schemes of the most dubious nature.

It is all about financial management. It is all about the use of taxpayers' funds. It is all about whether a government, because it cannot manage to get one project off the ground and employ one more person, is able, without major constraints and at will, suddenly to switch funds from that project to areas absolutely divorced from that original purpose of the funding.

What we are seeing here, exercised by this Government at the Federal level, is exactly the same sort of deceit leading down the same sort of road as we have seen in the decay of previous governments. The most spectacular was the Whitlam Government in 1975, when concealment of the facts was the cause of the undermining of the fabric of that Government and the fabric of our economy.

The question is a bit more complicated because I am advised that a number of other financial institutions have entered into confidentiality agreements so that they also can look at the documentation and then have discussions with those airline parties. It is not for me to say why, but one would speculate that it is quite possibly to enter into some sort of arrangement or procedure jointly with them. That is not something we will know until the close of the bids, and we really should not speculate. I was just trying to inform the honourable senator that a number of people are examining the documents but they may well not all be lead parties. Some of them may be institutions that are going to be secondary parties in consortiums or whatever. At this stage, that is not for us to speculate about. It will all be known fairly soon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, how did the $430,000 purchase by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of a half ownership in a piggery company turn into a shareholder's equity worth $4.2m within six weeks, or are the official company returns that show this simply false? If they are false, what is the Prime Minister doing to correct these false returns, or is he prepared, as a half owner, to endorse them? The Prime Minister can no longer hide behind personal abuse of me for daring to raise these matters of substance which he continually refuses to address. Detailed examination of the accounts of his half-owned piggery group show there has been continued flouting of the corporations law and breaches of Australian Securities Commission requirements which have had the effect of concealing the true financial position of Mr Keating's half-owned piggery group from the public and from the many people with whom it does business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hereby call on the Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission to require urgent corrections to the mass of false declarations and details made and included in this group's returns to the Australian Securities Commission; to impose penalties or other sanctions on the group for flouting its reporting requirements, and, if it has already done so, I would like to know what these penalties or sanctions have been; to enforce ASC requirements that the group meet minimum reporting standards, particularly as to timeliness; to require the Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd to file proper, full audited accounts for 1991, particularly in view of the false nature of the 1990 annual return's key financial data as established by the full 1990 accounts; to require the provision of audited reports for all the non-consolidated subsidiaries of the Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd for 1990 and 1991; and to establish whether the directors of Euphron Pty Ltd and Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd have committed offences under, inter alia, section 276 of the corporations law by failing to prepare proper consolidated accounts. If no action has yet been taken, I ask the ASC to advise me why not, and when such action will be instituted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background to this matter is that the Prime Minister's family company, Pleuron Pty Ltd, paid $430,000 to acquire a half interest in a piggery holding company, Euphron Pty Ltd, on 15 May 1991, while he was Federal Treasurer, giving him half ownership of the Brown and Hatton group of companies, of which former Labor Minister John Brown was a previous half owner and whose $100 of non-voting J class redeemable preference shares were redeemed at par on 10 August 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This group has entered into an $80m joint venture agreement with the Danish Danpork Group to produce pork based on Brown and Hatton Group's Parkville piggery in the Upper Hunter area of New South Wales. Mr Keating's declaration of interest to the Parliament made on 7 June 1991 simply said that he had acquired shares in a company with interests&mdash;in fact, it was a 100 per cent interest&mdash;in a piggery and refrigeration business but that he did not have control and was not a director. In reality, he has nominees as directors and he has never declared his interest in the multimillion dollar, multinational joint venture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis of the huge rise in the Prime Minister's equity to $4.2m is an unexplained extraordinary increase in assets outlined in the annual returns of the piggery holding company, Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd, which are grossly inadequate, open to serious question and in flagrant breach of the Companies Act. Mr Keating must come clean on whether he endorses his half-owned piggery group's annual returns that state his equity at $4.2m or whether, in his view, they massively overstate it, as his answer to Paul Lyneham on ABC television indicated last month. As no audited accounts have been filed with the Australian Securities Commission to support this extraordinary valuation, in breach of the corporations law, although they were due almost a year ago, the Prime Minister has an obligation as a half owner of this group to ensure that such audited accounts be filed and to either endorse or deny them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present the only documentation available for public scrutiny is an inadequate, misleading, brief exempt proprietary form of annual return which reveals only key financial data and which was filed in May of this year, six months late. This showed a $10m, or 50 per cent, rise to almost $30m in total assets of Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd from 1990, but only a $3.7m, or 20 per cent, increase in total liabilities to $22.2m on the other side of the balance sheet, providing a totally unexplained $7.8m discrepancy following an operating loss of $1.5m during the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This unexplained rise lifted shareholders' equity in Mr Keating's half-owned piggery holding company, Euphron Pty Ltd&mdash;which consolidates the Brown and Hatton Group&mdash;to a stated $8.4m. This inexplicable rise is despite the fact that the group's directors certified in May 1991, within six weeks of the end of the financial year, that nothing likely to affect significantly the group's state of affairs had arisen since June 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what happened from mid-May 1991, when Mr Keating acquired his half interest, magically to increase the net worth of this group? Perhaps Mr Keating would like to explain the apparently unexpected increase in the group's assets that gave the Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd the appearance of significant substance by lifting its net tangible assets&mdash;from minus $3.1m in 1990, when it was technically insolvent, to $2.9m by June 1991&mdash;and lifting 1990's stated shareholders' equity of only $1.3m, which included goodwill of $4.5m, to a stated $7.5m in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The absence of fully audited public company accounts for the Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd for 1991 is of major concern in view of the false nature of the 1990 accounts of the group, as established by a detailed examination of them which I now seek leave to table. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is particularly disappointing that, although the group's annual return to the Australian Securities Commission for 1991 indicated that it was a public company for all but six weeks of the financial year, the Australian Securities Commission appears to have allowed it to get away without filing full audited public company accounts as the law requires. The misleading, brief and inadequate `exempt proprietary' style of accounts appears to have been accepted as the only accounts available for public view. I now ask the Australian Securities Commission to correct this situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whenever the facts of the Prime Minister's $4.2m stated equity in a piggery group have been raised in this chamber, going back to my first revelations five months ago, the Government's usual response has been that I have been `muck-raking without a shred of evidence'. This week Senator Button claimed once again that I was totally wrong and accused me of a `total misrepresentation of everything'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last month, when Prime Minister Paul Keating was asked by the ABC's Paul Lyneham whether he did or did not know that the book value of his pig farm increased by 10 times in six weeks, his answer&mdash;which, for some extraordinary reason, was excised from the official Prime Minister's transcript&mdash;was, `No, no'. His only explanation was, `Look, well, the thing is, you've got to know how to read a set of company accounts'. When asked by Mr Lyneham, `Given the innocence of this business venture of yours, why don't you prove it by opening the books?', the Prime Minister responded, avoiding any substantive answer, by saying, `Don't tell me you're picking up this muck, Paul'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would be no need for the books to be `opened up' if only the Keating piggery group would cease its consistent and flagrant breaches of the corporations law by its pattern of false and misleading company returns&mdash;or failure to submit them&mdash;to the Australian Securities Commission. Just meeting the legal requirements would do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, those returns that have reluctantly and belatedly eventually been filed with the Australian Securities Commission raise some serious questions about the financial integrity of the group. All these returns were filed after Mr Keating became a half owner of the group, although he himself has not signed any of them. Nearly all of them were submitted to the ASC only after my initial criticism five months ago of the group's failure to file returns with the ASC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple issue that the Prime Minister cannot avoid by bluster or abuse is that the public has a right to know how its Prime Minister could purchase for $430,000 or $43,000&mdash;depending on which of the company's various returns is correct&mdash;a half share in this piggery and refrigeration group, which is reported by the company itself to be represented only six weeks later by a shareholders' equity of $4.2m. The public is entitled to know whether the Prime Minister bought his half share at an incredibly cheap price or whether the group's accounts deliberately overstate their real value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister&mdash;judging by his answer to Paul Lyneham&mdash;does `know how to read a set of company accounts', perhaps he can explain which of these two options is the right one. This is apart from the general question of the Prime Minister's failure to declare his interest in an $80m multinational piggery joint venture which depends on governmental approvals for its development, along with his admitted failure to advise the Foreign Investment Review Board of his involvement when approval for a draft joint venture was sought last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's main response to my past revelations has been by way of personal pressure on editors&mdash;including telephone calls to their homes&mdash;and to journalists not to print my evidence and to blackguard me as a purveyor of unsubstantiated muck. This has had some success, with one journalist describing me in these terms in an article with his newspaper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, not being prepared to carry my letter in response. Another falsely claimed on radio I had produced not one shred of evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now invite the Prime Minister to address the substance of today's detailed examination of the annual returns and accounts of this group of which he is the half owner and to advise the Australian people whether he has in fact acquired a $4.2m shareholders' equity in the group for $430,000, or whether the group's annual returns falsely and misleadingly overstate its real worth.

One might wonder whether it is incomplete or not, reflecting the desires of those who are awaiting the outcome of this review.

Has the structure of the fund been changed and, if so, on whose initiatives?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A summary of the overview of findings is that extraordinary withdrawals have occurred with financial advantages to two former members, and that these financial advantages did not reduce past members' accumulated benefits but would have reduced the level of the reserve fund which was distributed on 1 March 1992. The initiator of extraordinary payments is unknown but all trustees should have been involved in the decision to transfer benefits. The fund has not operated in accordance with the trust deed and there is no other documentary evidence to support the trustee's actions. There have been breaches of the occupational superannuation standards which could cause loss of tax concessions for the funds. These are extremely serious findings. </PARA>

Precisely because of this possibility we recommended that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission be able to impose a range of civil penalties and institute criminal proceedings against trustees and directors of corporate trustees. We recommended that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission be given power to institute civil proceedings against trustees and directors of corporate trustees on behalf of members.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Prime Minister is among the investors in a large Danish-Australian joint venture to establish a pig slaughterhouse in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In preparation of the launch Keating has held several meetings with Danpork's MD Rene Madelaire and board chairman, Ole Jacobsson. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Danish-Australian deal was finalised during the recent visit of Denmark's minister for agriculture Laurits Toernaes to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Remember that the date of this article was 16 April 1992, and we now know that there was a meeting on 8 April 1992 between Mr Crean and Mr Toernaes and that Mr Crean's recall note said that he was pleased with the progress evident in the joint venture. Mr Crean stands by his recall note, and I have sent that note over to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) for him to give permission for it to be tabled. I ask that it be tabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button, in reply to questions by me on 3, 16, 17, 18 and 19 June, said that there had not been any ministerial discussions on the importation of live pigs and/or genetic material. Senator Button always replied that the only discussions that had taken place were on 20 May 1990 between the Federation of Danish Industries and Australian Government departments, including AQIS and Primary Industries and Energy. He also said that two people who were later to become members of the Danish joint venture had been present at the meeting. Senator Button always maintained that this was the only meeting that had ever taken place, and never at ministerial level. Yet AQIS ministerial briefings to Minister Griffiths dated April 1992 and 23 June 1992 clearly stated that there was a ministerial meeting on 8 April between Minister Crean and the Danish Agriculture Minister, Mr Toernaes, and that pig semen had been discussed at this meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told in Estimates that media coverage forced AQIS to correct the AQIS briefing note on 15 October 1992&mdash;four months later. On 3 June, AQIS wrote a letter in which it stated, under the heading `Live Pigs', that access for live pigs had been first raised in the mid-1980s but in the 1990s had re-emerged as an issue at prime ministerial level in the context of a joint venture between Danish and Australian pig breeding and processing interests. The same letter referred to `having regard to government to government discussions over the years and recent Minister to Minister discussions, it will be necessary to give some priority to the longstanding Danish request'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Six weeks after the original letter and after the Senate question to Senator Button and a freedom of information application by me, on 21 July AQIS wrote a letter saying that the 3 June letter incorrectly advised that the issue of possible live imports from Denmark re-emerged at prime ministerial level in April 1990. However, the reference in the 3 June letter to `recent Minister to Minister discussions' was not referred to or denied. When asked at the Estimates how the reference to the Prime Minister came into the letter and whether they often threw in the Prime Minister's name when he had nothing to do with the issue, the officer could not explain, despite the letter having been written by a committee of three senior and professional AQIS officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was not the only time AQIS officers had written important documents stating that events occurred, in most definite terms, on which months later they were corrected. It has happened on at least six occasions. In April, AQIS wrote a return briefing to Minister Griffiths in which it stated that Danish authorities had recently renewed with Minister Crean long-standing demands for consideration by AQIS of imports of Danish-origin unprocessed pig meat and pig semen. In fact, AQIS sent us two copies of this letter under freedom of information. The second one we received the day before the last Estimates hearing. The first, which had been sent months earlier, had `pig semen' totally blacked out. At Estimates Minister Cook exclaimed `Oh, come on', when it was suggested that the blacked-out words were `and pig semen'. The acting AQIS head, Mr Gascoine, said that the letter he wanted us to have was the one without the blacking-out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This AQIS briefing paper was only one reference to pig semen being discussed at the ministerial meetings. The other is in a briefing to Minister Griffith, with a copy to Mr Crean dated 23 June 1992. In this briefing, AQIS stated that the Danish Minister for Agriculture would raise the matter of uncooked pig meat and pig semen during discussions with Mr Crean in April 1992. This briefing took place after the April ministerial meeting. Despite a copy going to Minister Crean, who was actually at the meeting, the veracity of the briefing paper was never questioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was so until 15 October, when we were told at Estimates that the Department, prompted by media reports, on 23 June 1992 sent to Minister Crean a correction of the Minister Griffiths briefing note. This correction was signed by an acting director in AQIS, Mr Gascoine, and specifically corrected the 23 June briefing headed `Importation of Pig Meat and Pig Genetic Material from Denmark'. The correction said that the reference to pig semen was incorrect and the recall note of the meeting prepared by an officer of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy made no reference to the importation of pig genetic material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Estimates, when the AQIS officer was asked why he put in the words `pig semen', he said that he recollected a phone call with Minister Crean's office, named an officer as probably Mr Roberts, and then contended that his recollection of events was incorrect&mdash;another definite assertion in important correspondence which months later has been said to be incorrect and has been corrected. Despite a request for a copy of this minute, it has not been received and it was not included in the FOI material, despite our asking for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First there were the discussions at Prime Minister level on live pig imports, then the Minister to Minister discussions, now the reference to ministerial discussions on pig semen, which, despite its being in two separate ministerial briefings, AQIS now says was incorrect. There are others. The reference in the 23 June briefing paper to Minister Griffiths stated that the joint venture ultimately would include Danish pig genetic material. Yet, when questioned at Estimates, despite this appearing in an official briefing paper, the AQIS writer said it was only speculation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were further issues which we were not able to cover at the Estimates, such as Mr Crean's background briefing paper dated 9 April, where AQIS stated that it understood that Danish interests might use Australian genotypes, thus:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . delaying imports of more suitable Danish genotypes until the quarantine control infrastructure is in place and the political climate is more favourable.</PARA>
<PARA>What would be AQIS's answer to this? Did it mean what it wrote, or is it once again writing things so they can later be corrected? Here is an AQIS officer commenting on the political climate and the political sensitivity of a matter. Even the AQIS cablegram categorically stated that higher priority was until recently being placed on these tasks, as imports of genetic material were linked to a joint venture proposal between Australia and the Danish industry that was being forged during 1991-92. The present Prime Minister was in office then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the first Estimates hearing AQIS said that the words in the cablegram really meant that the new officer in Brussels was just seeking clarification of why we were giving priority to the issue at the time. One could understand that AQIS could possibly make one or two mistakes&mdash;they would be straws in the wind&mdash;but when the mistakes start adding up to half a dozen they start to look like a haystack. What are we meant to think? Senator Button told the Senate that Mr Keating had discussions with his joint venture partner, Mr Jacobsson&mdash;this would have taken place around 8 April 1992&mdash;when Mr Jacobsson was part of a delegation with the Danish agriculture Minister, Mr Toernaes. As told by Senator Button, Mr Keating said it was a private matter, but it is a matter of public importance. Here was the Prime Minister discussing with his joint partner a project which, on Mr Crean's assertion, was being mentioned at Minister to Minister talks. Mr Keating's joint venture fits the category of pork joint ventures, and Mr Crean told Mr Toernaes he was pleased with their progress. All this took place around 8 April, before AQIS was formally advised of the joint venture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating insists in his <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> denial that the joint venture had no intention of importing pigs or breeding material and had not been the subject of ministerial talks. Mr Keating may not have been pushing for importing genetic material but his joint venture partner and its government were. If we are to believe the AQIS letters and ministerial briefings, the Danish authorities were pushing for it. The end result is still the same: the Prime Minister's joint venture company benefits. Joint ventures do not just happen; they need lots of preparation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How could the Prime Minister, when Treasurer, get himself involved in a project that needed so many government decisions and government-led changes? How can a most relevant government department, AQIS, on a most relevant issue for the success of the joint venture&mdash;importing pig genetic material&mdash;make not one, but six, major mistakes that need correcting from assertions of prime ministerial and ministerial discussions on genetic materials connected to the joint venture that are backed up by international cablegram and senior ministerial briefings?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A detailed analysis of the returns filed by companies in the Euphron-Brown and Hatton Group reveals consistent breaches of the Corporations Law and Australian Securities Commission requirements by:-</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the failure of the Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd to file its detailed public company accounts for 1990 until forced by request from the ASC to do so in July 1992&mdash;more than a year and a half after the due date of December 1990 and after the Group had belatedly filed an inadequate and false statement of key financial data in its 1990 annual return on 10 January 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.By filing for public view an annual return for 1990 containing a statement of key financial data that was significantly false in that it overstated by at least $23 million the net tangible assets of Brown and Hatton Group Limited and two of its subsidiaries (the remaining subsidiaries were not consolidated, nor were full accounts filed for them); this overstatement was probably by another million dollars or so in view of further false declarations within the return; the $19.85 million that it stated to be the net tangible assets of the Group in its key financial data return was subsequently revealed in the full return to be, instead, the total of gross assets which, after deducting $18.54 million in liabilities, gave net assets of only $1.3 million&mdash;and when intangible assets of $4.45 million were deducted (being owed for goodwill to Mr John Brown's company), the real net tangible assets position deteriorated to a negative $3.14 million. So instead of being almost $20 million as claimed, net tangible assets were at least&mdash;$3 million and probably much worse making the group technically insolvent. This false return does not appear to have been questioned by the ASC despite its seriously misleading nature. To this time it has not been corrected and is the return provided by the ASC in response to public enquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The detailed public company 1990 accounts, eventually and reluctantly filed on 10(th) July 1992 (eighteen months late and signed on May 20 1991, six months late) are themselves false and misleading in several material particulars and have not been audited, in breach of ASC requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a)The statement that net profit for the year was $842,999 "after income tax" is clearly false, as is the Director's declaration that no item, transaction or event between balance date of June 30 1990 and the belated signing of the accounts on May 20 1991, would significantly affect the Group.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">c)A device has been used to give a false impression of the liquidity position of the company in that the $11.5 million "non current loan" due to Rincraft Pty Ltd (an associate company 100% owned by the Brown and Hatton Group's parent company Euphron Pty Ltd) is financed by short term borrowings (ie current liabilities) by Rincraft. These Rincraft current liabilities totalled $23.2 million and long term liabilities only $1.6 million at June 30 1991; at last enquiry there were no accounts yet filed by Rincraft for 1990 in clear breach of ASC requirements, but the same deceptive device to transfer short-term borrowings by the Group into apparent long-term liabilities is evident in those 1991 accounts that have been filed for Group companies.</PARA>

This is in breach of ASC requirements (and of the previously existing Companies Act in New South Wales) in that a public company's accounts must be presented to the annual general meeting&mdash;which in this case is claimed to have taken place two months before the accounts were signed.</PARA>

On the face of it, the Olympia companies' deficiencies ( all of which were falsely declared to have positive shareholders' funds) mean that they are technically insolvent, requiring Directors to be satisfied that debts can be met as and when they fall due. As a result, the Brown and Hatton Group's 1990 real net tangible assets have been overstated by at least $500,000 as a result of their non-consolidation into the Group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These failures to consolidate are worsened by the further failure to meet the ASC requirement that the accounts of non-consolidated subsidiaries should be in the same form (ie full public company form in these cases) as the holding company accounts. The ASC requirement for companies to file consolidated accounts that give a true and fair view of the profit and loss and state of affairs of the company entity has been ignored, particularly the requirement that non-consolidated accounts be accompanied by a note specifying why consolidation is impractical and outlining how the Group accounts are significantly affected by any transactions and balances between Group companies.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a)No full audited public company accounts for the Brown and Hatton Group have been filed and they are now 11 months overdue. An inadequate exempt proprietary form of annual return was submitted to the ASC on May 22 1992 (six months late) despite the requirement that a company must be exempt for the whole of the financial year to avoid the need to file full public company accounts, yet the Brown and Hatton Group did not revert to proprietary status until 16(th) May 1991. Although the annual return to the ASC indicated the Group was not an exempt proprietary company for the whole of the financial year, the ASC appears to have accepted this inadequate return as meeting its requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">b)The 1991 key financial data of Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd shows a $10m or 50 per cent rise to $29.8 million in total assets from 1990 but only a $3.7 million or 20 per cent rise in total liabilities to $22.2 million on the other side of the balance sheet, despite an operating loss of $1.5 million during the year. There is no explanation given for such an extraordinary $7.8 million discrepancy that lifted Euphron Pty Ltd's shareholders' equity to $8.4 million, particularly as the Brown and Hatton Group's Directors certified in May 1991, within six weeks of the end of the financial year, that nothing likely to affect significantly the Group's state of affairs had arisen since June 1990. It is this unexplained and apparently unexpected increase in the Group's assets that gave the Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd the appearance of significant substance with its reported shareholders' equity of $7.5 million indicating far greater strength than 1990's $1.3 million and with net tangible assets of $2.9 million against minus $3.1 million in 1990. These significant rises cannot simply be explained by the apparent consolidation of previously unconsolidated subsidiaries such as the Olympia Refrigeration Group into the 1991 accounts.</PARA>

In addition, Euphron Pty Ltd appears to have consolidated the wholly owned Brown and Hatton Group into its 1991 accounts but appears to exclude another 100 per cent owned subsidiary, Rincraft Pty Ltd. The ASC requires the company to receive approval not to consolidate, or else to provide an accompanying note with the accounts specifying the reasons why the incorporation of all subsidiaries into one set of consolidated accounts was impractical and the extent to which Group accounts are significantly affected by balances or transactions between non-consolidated subsidiaries and the Group.</PARA>

The Prime Minister's nominee, to be responsible for managing his and his family company's half share in the Brown and Hatton Group, is a Mr Coudounaris, who is the secretary of the Prime Minister's family company. Mr Coudounaris and Mr Constantinidis reportedly were the ones who travelled to Denmark to seal the joint venture arrangements with Danpork, Brown and Hatton having been earlier chosen by that company as its Australian partner. The joint venture was publicly announced in April this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public records so far available relating to the holding company of the Brown and Hatton Group, Euphron, and its wholly owned subsidiaries show a complex web of interests and financial flows, including borrowings. What we find leaves us with a clear impression that statutory reporting requirements have not been properly met and, indeed, that offences may well have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the wider context, we find that the joint venture announced in April this year has in fact been some years in the making and goes back perhaps to the beginning of 1989. Two developments march side by side. There is, on the one hand, the restructuring of the Brown and Hatton Group of companies, its purchase of piggeries, the buy in by the Prime Minister's family company, the withdrawal of the original owners&mdash;Mr John Brown and Mr Vince Hatton&mdash;from the group and, finally, the setting up of Danpork Australia as a joint venture between the Brown and Hatton Group and the Danish interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, there has been a series of high level visits to Australia by Danish interests, including ministerial visits beginning in April 1989, the purpose of which was to bring about a joint venture and to equip this with Danish technology and pig reproductive material&mdash;that is, live pigs or pig semen from Denmark. The latter aspect involved approaches by the Danish joint venture partner for a revision of Australia's quarantine requirements, and lengthy discussions with officers of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not clear at what point the Danish interest Danpork set its sights on Brown and Hatton or vice versa. There are grounds for thinking a link may have been in existence by the first half of 1991. The name `Danpork Australia' was registered on 1 July that year. In April 1991 a new holding company for the Brown and Hatton group, Euphron, was registered. A month later the Prime Minister and his family company, Pleuron, made a $430,000 investment in Euphron. Pleuron had been registered towards the end of 1989. From the time the Prime Minister's family company was registered in November 1989 until it acquired its share in Euphron in April 1991, and thus a stake in the Danish joint venture, nothing is heard of it. Indeed, the Prime Minister's declaration of interest in January 1990, when he was the Treasurer, described it as inactive. However, this period&mdash;the year 1990&mdash;was a period of considerable activity by the Danish interests to obtain approval to import live pigs or pig breeding material, and thus involved directly the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. It is therefore of particular significance that an officer of that Service, writing on 3 June this year, should have claimed that pig imports had re-emerged as an issue `at Prime Ministerial level in the context of proposals for a joint venture'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has had ample opportunity, including when questioned on national television, to clarify his role and that of his family company in this whole matter. For reasons best known to himself, he has chosen not to do so. As Treasurer and as Prime Minister he has been in a privileged position generally as regards access to information, particularly information as to Danish interests and details of their position. He was in a particular position of privilege as Treasurer in relation to the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Commonwealth Bank, and each of these agencies played an important part in securing developments which advantaged his investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister, in notifying his family company's investment, claimed that neither he nor his family members exercised any control; yet his nominee, Mr Coudounaris, clearly has a 50 per cent interest. He appears to have failed to notify the Registrar of Members' Interests of Brown and Hatton's redemption of their J class shares which left the Prime Minister with an effective 50 per cent control. Indeed, the issue of the Prime Minister's disclosure of interest is a critically important matter. Every member of parliament is required to notify the Registrar of Members' Interests when his or her assets change significantly. In accordance with this requirement, Mr Keating wrote to the Registrar on 7 June 1991 to advise of his investment in the Brown and Hatton pig business in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I advise that on 15 May 1991 my family company Pleuron Pty Limited and I made an investment by way of acquisition of shares in Euphron Pty Limited, a company which has interests in a piggery and a refrigeration fabrication business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The interests acquired by both Pleuron Pty Limited and me in Euphron Pty Limited do not constitute a controlling interest in that company, nor do I or any member of my family hold a directorship of that company.</PARA>
<PARA>This statement is misleading to the point of dishonesty. A company is controlled by any person who can carry a vote at a meeting of shareholders. In fact, in certain circumstances control can be exercised with a minority shareholding, a fact recognised in legislation governing media cross-ownership and the review of foreign investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time Mr Keating and his family company acquired the shares in Euphron, John Brown and Vincent Hatton still held 100 J class shares. Those shares have no voting rights, thus Mr Keating and his family company acquired 50 per cent of the voting shares in Euphron and hence he exercised 50 per cent of the voting rights of Euphron. The other 50 per cent of the voting shares are held by Constantinidis and his family company, with corresponding voting rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is technically true that Mr Keating's interest is not a controlling interest in the sense that it does not give him majority control, it is clear that if he does not have a controlling interest then neither does Constantinidis or anyone else. In fact, Mr Keating shares equal control of the company. It follows that the claim by Mr Keating that `the interests acquired by both Pleuron Pty Limited and me in Euphron do not constitute a controlling interest in that company' is grossly misleading. Mr Keating immediately proceeds in his letter to bolster his assertion that he does not control Euphron by stating: `nor do I or any member of my family hold a directorship of that company'. This was strictly true at the time, and remains strictly true, and yet it only compounds the deceptive effect of the message conveyed by the letter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time Mr Keating acquired shares in Euphron, that company had three directors: Brown, Hatton and Constantinidis. On 10 August 1991, three months after Mr Keating acquired his interest in Euphron, Brown and Hatton resigned as directors of Euphron. On that same day Coudounaris was appointed a director. Constantinidis remained a director. His family company had also bought $430,000 worth of shares at the same time as Mr Keating. Coudounaris and Constantinidis have continued to remain the sole directors of Euphron. Coudounaris is a solicitor with the firm Gadens. He holds no shares in Euphron or in any other Brown and Hatton group company. Coudounaris is, however, the company secretary of Mr Keating's family company, Pleuron. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear from documents lodged with the ASC on behalf of Pleuron that Coudounaris undertakes Pleuron company business from time to time, which is hardly surprising for a company secretary. Coudounaris does not hold any shares in Euphron or any company in the group. These facts give rise to an irresistible inference that Coudounaris is Keating's representative, if not legal nominee, on the board of Euphron, the company that controls the Brown and Hatton pig business. It is inconceivable that the formal changes of directorship that occurred on 10 August 1990 and the redemption of the shares held by John Brown and Vincent Hatton were not in the contemplation of the parties at the time Mr Keating and Constantinidis each acquired $430,000 worth of shares on 15 May 1991. Indeed, it is likely that those changes merely gave effect to an agreement of which the purchase of shares was but a part. It would strain to the limits the credibility of a reasonable observer to suggest that the appointment of Coudounaris, or some other Keating nominee, as director was not contemplated by Mr Keating as at the date of his letter to the Registrar of Members' Interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To return to the statement about directorship of the company, true it is that neither Mr Keating nor a member of his family holds a directorship in Euphron. However, he has not written to the Registrar of Members' Interests to advise that his representative is now one of the two directors of Euphron. He has allowed the letter of 7 June 1991 to stand as an indisputably misleading description of the position that now obtains and has obtained since 10 August 1991, a position that was undoubtedly in contemplation at the time he wrote to the Registrar of Members' Interests on 7 June. These matters can no longer be ignored. A Prime Minister who does not hesitate to pour venom and scorn on anyone who crosses his path has now been presented with a very detailed and powerful case to answer. The character issue will certainly be a vital aspect of the forthcoming election. The Australian public will certainly await his reply with interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise the question of Queensland Government superannuation. On two previous occasions I have raised the matter of the funding of the Queensland Government's employee superannuation. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation has also been interested in the matter of the extent of funding of superannuation. Twice it has expressed its concern about the mounting levels of public sector debt. In its second report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Super Guarantee Bills</EMPHASIS>, the Committee noted that Queensland was the only State to have full funding. The Committee reached this conclusion as a result of evidence given at hearings in Brisbane. Until recently I was also of that view. However, I am fast approaching the conclusion that Queensland, along with the Commonwealth, other States and Territories, has a very high degree of unfunded superannuation debt and that the Committee may have been misled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week I raised my doubts and even ventured to place a rough estimate on the level of debt. If my speech had contained ill-informed or poorly reasoned analysis, I am sure the Queensland Government would have refuted my claims with expedition and force. The only public revelation that has occurred on the matter was made in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on Tuesday, 10 November, in the article headed `$278m hole found in Qld Police super scheme fund'. I seek leave to table the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> article. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first paragraph of that article reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Qld Government has been deeply embarrassed by an actuarial report which has found a $278 million deficit in the State Police Superannuation Fund.</PARA>
<PARA>As for the whole of the fund's actuarial assessment, that does not seem to have been done since about 1985, and there is even some doubt about the extent of that. If that is true, then the Queensland Government cannot claim to have fully funded superannuation. Its defence, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> article, is that the deficit is more than offset by the `substantial surplus' in other funds. There cannot be reserves within a consolidated revenue fund of a State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next question posed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> article is: how substantial is that surplus? The Queensland Treasurer was unable to answer that question because, according to the article, the next actuarial report on the major combined fund is not due until next year. To my knowledge, no actuarial reports on the various public sector superannuation funds operated by the Queensland Government have been published in the last few years. How could he then have claimed that full funding occurs? Would a more appropriate answer to the Senate Select Committee's questions on unfunding not have been, `We are not sure on whether we are fully funded as no recent actuarial or audit investigation has been carried out, but we will tell you next year or some time in the future'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Queensland Government is unable to provide an adequate rebuttal to the various serious points that have been raised in relation to the position of their employee superannuation, and it still maintains the position of full funding, I suggest that perhaps it should be seeking the services of some independent experts&mdash;say, our own Commonwealth Auditor-General, or even the Auditor-General from Tasmania, who recently reported on the position in that State in terms of the need for some sort of standard to be applied to public sector superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This case highlights the need for Commonwealth and State governments to convene a summit on public sector superannuation debt, and to come to an agreed position about the definition of public superannuation debt and the methods of measuring it, and the ways and means of reducing it. This is absolutely essential. To my knowledge, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland are prepared to come to the party and address the problem as part of a national initiative. It is time the Commonwealth and the other States were of the same inclination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Queensland Government is unable to point me in the direction of a fund which contains assets equal to all its superannuation liabilities for both present and previous employees, and if it is unable to point to actuarial and audit material which validates its claim regarding full superannuation, then it is highly likely that the Committee on which I sit, the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, has been misled. Misleading a Senate committee is an offence under parliamentary privilege, but more importantly, it seriously undermines the public perception and confidence in the work of parliamentary committees if agencies seeking the truth are not given correct information. I look forward to receiving a response, preferably from the Queensland Treasurer, to the issues I have raised. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition is not opposing the passage of this omnibus Bill, which makes amendments to a number of Acts. I will confine my comments to the main provisions of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 2 of the Bill deals with amendments to the Cash Transactions Reports Act, most of which have been recommended to the Attorney-General by the Ministerial Advisory Group on the Operation of the Cash Transactions Reports Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pursuant to these amendments, the account verification scheme will be modified to make it more flexible. The amendments in proposed new section 21A also make special provision with respect to certain specified groups of people who have changed their name. These groups are&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">people who change their name on marriage;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">people who revert to a former name, having previously been known by the name of a spouse;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">people who change their name to protect their personal safety, having been victims of violence or threatened violence; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">people who are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, and change their name to a traditional name.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People in these circumstances will be able to use a referee procedure to become a signatory to an account without having to meet the usual requirements in relation to documentation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments have been made in consultation with the cash dealing industry, and the Opposition is supporting them. We note the Minister's statement on the financial impact of this Bill that the changes to the account verification provisions may reduce the costs of compliance to cash dealers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its amendments to the Crimes Act 1914, Part 3 of this Bill introduces a penalty unit scheme into Commonwealth legislation, as recommended by the Gibbs Committee's Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law. Presently, maximum fines for offences against Commonwealth legislation are expressed in terms of dollars. Over time, inflation tends to render the amounts of the prescribed fines unrealistic; and the only way to remedy the problem has been to amend each individual provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments set the value of a penalty unit at $100.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Future legislation will prescribe the maximum number of penalty units for a particular offence. The Bill also provides a simple formula for converting certain penalties expressed in dollar figures in existing legislation, to penalty units.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In future, to reflect any change in the value of money, all pecuniary penalties for offences against Commonwealth legislation will be able to be adjusted, through a single amendment to the value of a penalty unit in the Crimes Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The penalty unit scheme will not apply to section 76 of the Trade Practices Act, or national scheme laws under the Australian Securities Commission Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill also amends section 15B of the Crimes Act, in relation to the time of commencement for prosecutions. At present, prosecutions may be commenced at any time if the offence attracts a maximum period of imprisonment of six months or more. In respect of other offences, prosecution must commence within one year of the commission of the offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, this has obvious shortcomings when the offender is a body corporate, as periods of imprisonment are not prescribed for offences which can only be committed by corporations. Prosecutions, irrespective of the seriousness of the offence, must always be commenced within one year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments to section 15B provide that prosecutions of corporations may be commenced at any time if the maximum penalty for the offence is a fine of 150 penalty units&mdash;$15,000&mdash;or more. Where the penalty is less than this amount, prosecutions must be commenced within one year of the commission of the offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill further amends the Crimes Act as recommended by the Gibbs Committee's Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law, by limiting the circumstances in which a court is restricted in imposing prison sentences by section 17A of the Act. The present provision, criticised by the committee as too general, is that where a person who has not previously been sentenced to imprisonment is convicted of an offence relating to property or money whose total value is less than $2,000, the court is not to impose a sentence of imprisonment unless there are exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pursuant to the amendments in this Bill, this limitation on the court's sentencing power will only apply to offences against a limited number of specified provisions of the Crimes Act, and prescribed provisions of other federal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill inserts a new part IV into the Crimes Act, relating to piracy. These amendments were recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its report on Criminal Admiralty Jurisdiction and Prize, in which serious shortcomings of present piracy law were identified. Principal among those shortcomings is the fact that the piracy law in Australia is presently dictated by a number of outdated Imperial Acts, such as the Piracy Act 1670. A list of these Acts to be repealed is in Schedule 2 of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the amendments, "act of piracy" is defined as in the 1958 Geneva Convention on the High Seas, to mean:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">an act of violence, detention or depredation committed for private ends by the crew or passengers of a private ship or aircraft and directed:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) if the act is done on the high seas or any coastal sea of Australia against another ship or aircraft or against persons or property on board another ship or aircraft; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) if the act is done in a place beyond the jurisdiction of any country against a ship, aircraft, persons or property.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The limitation to acts committed "for private ends" has been criticised in the past, because it is capable of being read as excluding some acts of politically motivated terrorism. However, the Law Reform Commission took the view that such acts would in any case be covered by the hijacking-related offences in the Crimes (Aviation) act and the recently-passed Crimes (Ships and Fixed Platforms) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Crimes Act in this Bill seem to us sensible and timely&mdash;in some cases well overdue&mdash;and we are supporting them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to the Customs Act 1901 provide for the Commissioner of Police or a Deputy Commissioner of Police to make decisions about the disposal of narcotic goods and narcotic-related goods. Further amendments enable the Court, on the application of various parties, to direct the Official Trustee to pay a pecuniary penalty from property held under a restraining order.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also amends the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983. It broadens the power of the Director to grant indemnities in respect of proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, Division 3 of Part XIII of the Customs Act 1901, and forfeiture of goods under the Customs Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further amendments relate to appearances by and on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, delegation by the Director and service of process on the Director.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments in Part 9 of the Bill to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 will enable Australia to comply with the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime. The Minister advised in his speech on the second reading of this Bill that Australia is likely to accede to this Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Specifically, the amendments provide that documents are admissible in evidence if they are provided by a party to the Money-Laundering Convention, where the proceeding arises from a request made by a foreign country for international assistance in a criminal matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition also welcomes the extension of the definition of "proceeds of crime" in the Proceeds of Crimes Act 1987. Currently, not all foreign offences are covered only those which are narcotic related. By this extension of the definition, other serious foreign offences will be covered, such as arms trafficking and kidnapping.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill also makes minor amendments, which the Coalition is supporting, to the Crimes (Aviation) Act 1991, the Crimes (Biological Weapons) Act 1976, the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989, and the Australian Federal Police Act 1979.</PARA>

It is emerging as a country not only with considerable strategic importance to Australia, but also with increasing economic importance. In particular, the level of trade and investment indicates Vietnam is emerging as one of Australia's major regional trading partners. Such major contracts as a 25-year contract between BHP and Petro-Vietnam for the exploration of oil and gas reserves over the central east coast of Da Nang as well as the granting of a banking licence to the ANZ Bank are some of the many examples that are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vietnam is increasingly being viewed as a predominantly untapped market for trade and investment. There has been a steady rise in both exports and imports over the past few years.

This has presented Australia with a window of opportunity to strengthen the economic position in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coupled with this advantage has been the factor that since 1987 Vietnam has been actively pursuing a policy of reconstruction which is an attempt to introduce a capitalist economic system as rapidly as possible while maintaining the socialist political system.

Relief from double taxation is desirable for without it, the expansion of trade and the movement of capital and people between countries could be harmed. In addition, the Bill clarifies the taxation position of income flows between the countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the three countries&mdash;Spain, Indonesia and Vietnam&mdash;who have signed this agreement with Australia, the Coalition has a number of comments to make with regard to Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Vietnam, a regional neighbour of Australia, is emerging as a country with not only considerable strategic importance to Australia, but also with increasing economic importance. In particular, the level of trade and investment indicates that Vietnam is emerging as one of Australia's major regional trading partners. Such major contracts as a 25 year contract between BHP and Petro-Vietnam, for the exploration and exploitation of oil and gas reserves over the central east coast of Da Nang as well as the granting of a banking licence to the ANZ Bank, are but two of the many examples available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Vietnam is increasingly being viewed as a predominantly untapped market for trade and investment and there has been a steady rise in both exports and imports over the past several years. One of the major factors contributing to this economic relationship is the current US Trade and Aid Embargo which has precluded US and Japanese trade and investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has presented Australia with a window of opportunity to strengthen its economic position in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Coupled with this advantage has been the factor that since 1987, Vietnam has been actively pursuing a policy of `reconstruction' which is an attempt to introduce as rapidly as possible a capitalist economic system while maintaining the socialist political system. It is stated in the country's constitution that foreign investment and co-operation is encouraged and that foreign enterprises will not be nationalised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, along with the Government, the Coalition is pleased that Australia is the first country with which Vietnam has entered into a double taxation agreement. Further, the Coalition is pleased that a feature of the agreement with Vietnam is that it provides for `tax sparing' credit relief to be extended by Australia for tax forgone by Vietnam under specified development incentives for the encouragement of foreign investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequently, where income derived by an Australian resident taxpayer has benefited from the development incentives to be nominated under the agreement, a tax credit will be allowed by Australia for the Vietnamese tax forgone under those incentive measures. The Government believes that by this means the development incentives will retain their attractiveness for Australian firms and allow them to compete for business in Vietnam on favourable terms with investors from other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Coalition welcomes this move, it believes that the Government has not gone far enough. It needs to go one further step if it is going to encourage this aforementioned mine of trade and investment. This step is one where the Government not only has this double tax agreement, but also recognises Vietnam as a comparable tax country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By recognising Vietnam as a comparable tax country, the onerous compliance burdens currently imposed by Australia's complex rules for taxing foreign income would be removed. These rules currently act as an impediment to the already mentioned significant trade and investment by Australia into Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Chamber should note that in terms of authorised foreign investment capital, Australia was, as at June 1991, the second largest source (behind Taiwan) of joint venture investment in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill today verifies that the Australian Government already considers Vietnam's tax system to be comparable to that of Australia. At the time of the introduction of the foreign source income provisions, it was stated that listing of a country as having a tax system comparable to that of Australia requires its tax system to meet certain indicative criteria. Vietnam now meets these criteria as stated in the document entitled `Taxation of Foreign Source Income Information Paper'&mdash;April, 1989. In particular,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1direct taxation is levied on income or profits;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">2the corporate tax base is comprehensive in that it includes any income accruing from the business activities of an enterprise; and thus includes income from the disposal of capital assets;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">3any tax incentives provided by Vietnam Government do not facilitate international profit shifting. Incentives are only provided to specific business projects, which have to be formally approved and carried out in Vietnam; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">4the standard corporate tax rate for foreign investors is 25% (except banking, oil and gas and rare resources, where it may be higher than 25%). Any reduction in this rate is designed to attract active business activities on a similar basis to the other tax regimes within the region which are listed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, since Vietnam already meets the requirements set for listing as a comparable tax country, this Government should not hesitate in listing Vietnam as a listed country on Schedule 10 for the purposes of Part X of the ITAA and give Vietnam not only double tax status, but comparable tax status.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is worth noting that all of Australia's other double tax treaty partners are listed countries for the purposes of Part X of the Act. When one considers that the Australian Government has already publicly recognised and supported the need to implement measures to position Australia to take advantage of the growth in the Vietnamese economy, the Coalition can only query why the comparable tax status has not been granted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to remind this Government of what the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, Mr John Kerin, stated following a visit of Australian Business representatives at the second annual meeting of the Joint Trade and Economic Co-operation Committee in Vietnam. Mr Kerin said and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Vietnam . . . is of considerable strategic importance to Australia and will become a country of great economic significance to Australia as well . . . I am aware of the need to position Australia to take advantage of the anticipated growth in the Vietnamese economy once the US trade and aid embargo has been lifted and large-scale multilateral bank lending resumes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, if Vietnam was listed as a comparable tax country, compliance burdens imposed by the Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) would no longer act as a significant impediment to Australian investment in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, Mr President, although the Coalition supports the bill before us today, it requests that the Government re-examines its view towards listing Vietnam as a comparable tax country for foreign source income measures.</PARA>

In relation to the second part, monthly figures in relation to employment and unemployment vary. The unemployment figure is up for this month of October; the employment figure is also up for this month of October; and that is a trend which has been followed for the past seven months. Insofar as the first part of the question is concerned, about the ending of the recession, as I have said on a number of occasions in this place, the consequences of the recession are not over&mdash;I have said that in the last month or so&mdash;and the major consequence is in terms of unemployment.</PARA>

One hundred and ten thousand British pensioners have a vital interest in this, so I would appreciate Senator Macdonald keeping quiet while I give an answer that is of interest to them. There is a problem affecting the pension of some 110,000 British pensioners living in Australia. That problem emanates from the present exchange rate volatility in the pound sterling, a currency which has fallen dramatically and precipitously in value against the Australian dollar in recent weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decrease has been so great and so volatile that it has outstripped mechanisms in the social security legislation which are designed to set exchange rates for purposes of calculating pension entitlements. There are two basic mechanisms in the legislation: one provides that the department sets the exchange rate four times a year, each time setting it for a three-month period; and the other trigger mechanism is designed to provide for sudden and dramatic changes in exchange rates, but this mechanism has proven to be inadequate to cope with last month's volatility in the pound sterling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present the exchange rate is $A1 to UK39.14p. There are two problems emanating from that exchange rate valuation: first, the average valuation varied from it during October 1992 by 11.2 per cent; and, secondly, the variations do not reflect the trend for sterling, irrespective of the volatility. Given the failure of the trigger mechanism, we have decided to intervene in the process and to set a new exchange rate based on $A1 to UK44.85p. This rate is based on the average Commonwealth Bank rate during the last two weeks of October and the rate will apply from 19 November.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill was not right from day one because, as I have said on a thousand occasions, the whole problem about an attempted solution which sought to exclude the Khmer Rouge from the outset&mdash;the so-called tripartite solution which had the other parties grouped together with the support of the international community to somehow isolate the Khmer Rouge&mdash;is that it did not deal with the fundamental problem of external support for the parties concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Khmer Rouge isolated but with continuing military and other support from the Chinese Government in particular and others playing a supporting role as well, was a very much more dangerous proposition than a Khmer Rouge isolated without that support. That is the situation we have at the moment: the Khmer Rouge isolated within a continuing process to which the rest of the international community is wholly committed. The international community&mdash;those of them represented at the meeting in Beijing last week&mdash;made that commitment abundantly clear, and that was the most heartening thing, I believe, about those talks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Teague said, the matter is going to be dealt with in the Security Council, probably next week. Australia is not a member of the Security Council so we will not, as such, be putting proposals to it.

<PARA>A number of questions were asked in Question Time in relation to the appalling level of unemployment at 11.5 per cent, as shown in the figures released today.

I remind him of these words used by one of his colleagues nine or 10 years ago: `Any Government which has presided over 11 per cent unemployment is not fit to govern'. Does anyone remember who said that? It is a quote from Question Time. Mr Hawke said that during a short period of unemployment that occurred in 1982-83, not the sustained level which has been going on for the last two or three years with, as I said, no light at the end of the tunnel. </PARA>

Honourable senators might recall Mr Keating's remarks: `We pull the levers. I can do anything with the levers'. He talked about bringing home the bacon. The only bacon he has brought home is the tragedy of unemployment and the social dislocations that inevitably come from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to a question from Senator Chapman regarding the failed accord, Senator Cook went on about the ACTU being involved in a national day of protest in an educative campaign.

They have become the forgotten people of this country. Yet on the other side, we have people who know in their own hearts that, to get this economy back on track, we must introduce a flexible system within the industrial relations policy. They cannot and will not do it, as has been said by Paul Kelly in his book, because of the vested ties to the trade unions.

Let us have a look at what Victorians think about the situation. A survey was conducted into the strike and various other aspects of the events in Victoria on 2 and 3 November. The article carrying the survey is headed, `More unions back strike'. The survey itself shows what the people of Victoria think. After all, they are the important part of the Victorian scene. To the question, `Strikes and other industrial action only after a secret ballot of workers', 65 per cent approved, 59 per cent of whom were union members and 72 per cent were not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The next question is interesting and flies absolutely in the eye of the Minister's refusal here today to answer the question and come out and do what is right and proper. The question was asked: `$50,000 fines on unions for unlawful strikes and other industrial action'. Fifty-nine per cent of Victorians said that that policy should be put in place. So much for the critics when they turn around and get stuck into Mr Kennett for what he is doing. He has the support of the Victorians for his policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The survey showed that 64 per cent approved of the abolition of compulsory unionism. A little further on in the survey, 55 per cent supported the statement, `Negotiated contracts lasting no more than five years'. The next statement concerned the immediate abolition of the 17.5 per cent holiday loading to public sector workers, of which 59 per cent approved. There are a number of further questions in the survey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Ministers here&mdash;Senator Button has come into the chamber&mdash;refuse to acknowledge the real cause of these figures. As Senator Parer said, one of the prime causes of the problems in this country today is our rigid industrial system. When Ministers stand in this place and talk about the importance of how they have made the system flexible through certified agreements, we find that just over 4 per cent of the work force are operating under certified agreements. There has been plenty of opportunity for the Government to make the system more flexible. If the system was more flexible, more attractive and was getting more people back into the work force through lifting productivity, then the resulting figures would have been much higher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistently, Senator Cook espouses the virtues of these certified agreements. If certified agreements are as good as they are supposed to be, the whole of the Australian work force and the employers would be flocking to them at 100 miles an hour; yet in this Victorian survey, referring to workplace agreements&mdash;the policy we are espousing, the policy that Mr Kennett is putting in place in Victoria&mdash;55 per cent of all Victorians support them. This Government has failed totally to address the issue of unemployment in this country as a result of its economic mismanagement and the archaic industrial system that exists in this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>As I have said often in debates in this chamber on the wool industry&mdash;and it seems there have certainly been a number of them in recent years&mdash;Australia has ridden on the sheep's back for years. The wool industry over time has provided much of our export earnings. Until the troubles of recent years the industry had been Australia's greatest earner of export dollars. This report says on page 5:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The year 1991-92 was a period of `bedding down' for the new corporations.</PARA>
<PARA>Those new corporations to which it refers were the result of the upheavals in the industry which peaked in the previous year. That year, 1990-91, saw the end of an era in the history of the Australian wool industry&mdash;a year when the reserve price scheme, the foundation of a wool marketing scheme that served the industry well for 20 years, was abandoned. Indeed, on page 4 of this report the Council notes that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The termination of the reserve price scheme and increased market unpredictability which followed resulted in much entrepreneurial activity to investigate alternative selling systems.</PARA>
<PARA>To call the aftermath of that period `increased market unpredictability' is to understate in some ways the havoc which was foisted on this industry. As I said, 1990-91 was one of the most difficult years in the history of the wool industry. The depressed demand, due largely to the withdrawal of China and the USSR from the market, coupled with large wool supplies put the reserve price scheme under increasing pressure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the decision by the then Minister for Primary Industries, John Kerin, to lower the guaranteed minimum floor price to 700c in May 1990 was intended to stimulate demand, it failed to do so, and speculation on the future of the reserve price scheme persisted. Indeed, Australian Wool Corporation purchases reached record levels, accounting for 50 per cent to 70 per cent of weekly offerings, with stocks purchased through the scheme reaching 4.7 million bales by the end of January 1991. Then on 11 February, on the board's reluctant recommendation, the Government suspended the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme operated successfully for all but the last 18 months of those years, providing price stability for growers and the wool textile industry alike. This in turn helped to position wool as a leading textile fibre, made wool-growing a profitable farm enterprise, and earned vital export income for this nation. The combination of adverse world economic and wool supply factors, the equal of which had never been seen before in the industry's history, put unprecedented pressure on the capacity of the scheme to cope. However, as many in the industry know only too well, it was the surrounding debate and continuing speculation about the sustainability of the scheme that ultimately killed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the wool crisis was brought about by a series of events here in Australia, overseas in our markets, and in government. It was in no way connected with the management and structure of the AWC, which had been carefully developed by commercial exports over many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, this report starts from the period when, under legislation introduced in June 1991, the Australian Wool Corporation was replaced by three bodies: the Australian Wool Realisation Commission; a new Australian Wool Corporation; and the Wool Research and Development Corporation&mdash;effective from 1 July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have told the Senate in a number of debates on this issue, nowhere had it been demonstrated&mdash;as distinct from being asserted&mdash;that were the offer price for Australian wool to be lowered, there would be any kind of direct and significant demand response. Further, and more importantly, it had not been shown that any such response would ensure that gross income to the industry would increase or even be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One very wrong thing the Government did was to lower the floor price. That was just one of the numerous actions for which the Government must be held responsible. The sad situation is that this has been a lesson for the Government&mdash;an experiment which has impacted adversely on the livelihoods of many farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government may have wanted to make the industry more commercial, and it may have wanted to allow the industry to have more say; but, in fact, right now it has achieved the exact opposite, whereby the industry more than ever has been at the mercy of the Government. I hope that this Government takes note of the recommendations made by people active in the industry. </PARA>

<PARA>The seminar, whose proceedings I have just tabled, was organised by the Select Committee on Superannuation in conjunction with the Trade Practices Commission and the National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council, and was held in the Main Committee Room on Wednesday, 4 November 1992. It drew over 100 key participants in the personal superannuation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The seminar occurred at a most opportune time in that it allowed the Committee to focus its mind on the issues which relate to two of its outstanding terms of reference&mdash;namely, the level of fees, charges and commissions; and the level of information available to members of superannuation funds. The Committee has had a longstanding interest in the matter of the disclosure of matters relating to personal superannuation products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a previous occasion, the Committee reported to the Senate that it had not received the full cooperation of the insurance industry in its endeavours to gather in camera evidence on the structure of fees and charges in that industry in the personal superannuation area. Since that report, the Committee has received the assistance that it required and, in addition, has convened a productive, private hearing with representatives of the Life Insurance Federation of Australia to explore the matter further. Further, the Committee prepared an issues paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Super Charges</EMPHASIS>, which it tabled during the week of the 1992 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be an understatement to say that the Committee's work in this area has been both intensively and extensively reported by the media. It appears that the matter is one which excites the interest of many who have made decisions, possibly ill-judged, to participate in non-occupational superannuation. In fairness to the life insurance industry, whilst there has been a significant number of poor decisions, the majority of consumers, according to two surveys reported at the seminar, are satisfied with their particular superannuation products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advent of the superannuation guarantee charge has meant that over 800,000 Australian employees who do not come under award superannuation need to decide where their superannuation entitlements should be deposited. The new focus is not only on employees. No doubt many thousands of small business operators in the environment of increasing super coverage will decide to purchase new super plans or increase their level of contributions to existing schemes.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact remains that long term superannuation growth will occur only if the industry&mdash;and here I embrace both superannuation funds and superannuation products sold by insurance companies&mdash;operates in a climate of competitive efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the consumer concerns relating to superannuation have centred on the sale of roll-over and regular premium personal superannuation products. The consumer concerns&mdash;and this was borne out at the seminar&mdash;have their origins in the extent to which agent commissions are `front-end loaded' and whether these were disclosed at the time of sale. The lowering of returns on funds invested has contributed to consumers of these products subjecting a greater scrutiny on the performance of their respective super funds and, consequently, expressing disenchantment. At the super consumer seminar, these matters received the undivided attention of over 20 speakers and panellists from the full range of parties interested in personal and roll-over superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I would like to say that the Committee or the Parliament dominated proceedings, on this occasion it was a triumvirate of the electorate, the executive and the judiciary that prevailed. Fortunately, their combined intercessions and interventions were in the interests of improving the lot of superannuation consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conference chairman, Justice Paul Stein, in his excellent summing-up, expressed the nature of the task confronting the Committee as it winds up its inquiry into consumer aspects of superannuation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems to me that we have now come to a crucial pass. All the major players, including the agents, the life offices, the Government and the consumers need to be locked into change by adopting a true partnership model of reform. Each stakeholder must be prepared to be flexible about the detail of change and its implementation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I must stress that the changes must not compromise basic consumer rights which must be enhanced in the process. If they are, we all profit and so will the nation. Conversely, if they do not, we have a bleak future. As I said in my opening remarks, we must get it right. We must get it right now. We must not be in the position of picking up the pieces later. The respective parties need to demonstrate to each other the utmost of good faith.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that the Committee will follow the spirit of Justice Stein's words as it deliberates on its recommendations on disclosure, fees and commissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank my fellow Committee members for supporting the super consumer seminar. Thanks should also be recorded for those from the Trade Practices Commission and the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs who assisted in organising the seminar, not to mention those in the Committee Secretariat who played a role in compiling this record of proceedings. The seminar occurred at a time when the Hansard resources of the Parliament were stretched to the limit. It would be unfair if I did not acknowledge the fine work of the team of Hansard and Sound and Vision Office staff who turned around these proceedings in such a timely way. I commend this report to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before closing, I will share with fellow senators some thoughts and impressions arising out of my recent stopover in London where I was able to meet key players in the superannuation industry in the United Kingdom. I will also share these thoughts with seminar participants because they go to the heart of consumer concerns&mdash;namely, the security of savings placed in the hands of trustees and fund managers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt most members of the Senate and the Australian community would have heard something of the Maxwell superannuation fraud. Whilst in the United Kingdom, I had the opportunity to talk to many of the main players&mdash;the regulators&mdash;in the superannuation industry, representatives of the members of the Maxwell superannuation funds, the chair of the House of Commons social security committee and Professor Goode, who is chair of the pension law review committee. For those of the Senate who are not familiar with it, the Maxwell fraud involved #800m of moneys that were stolen from seven Maxwell pension funds in a variety of Mr Maxwell's companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that perhaps some #400m will be recovered, although there can be no final figure because it will take perhaps three to four years for the courts of law to determine who owns some of the assets that were stolen. At best it appears that some #400m, about half of the money stolen, will be recovered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some 32,000 pensioners in the Maxwell pension funds. Needless to say, my discussions and meetings with their representatives disclosed a grave concern amongst the pensioners in the funds as to what will happen to their pensions which are being paid from the funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Maxwell fraud is interesting in a number of respects. Clearly the sheer size of the looting that took place is quite staggering. What was also interesting is that the House of Commons social security committee was in fact carrying out an investigation of the Maxwell superannuation funds. Whilst this investigation was being carried out and persons were giving evidence to the House of Commons committee, literally hundreds of millions of pounds were being removed from the superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to ask ourselves: how could it happen? How could #800m be stolen from superannuation funds? It is a particularly important question to ask, because much of the regulation in the United Kingdom is dependent upon so-called trust law. Much of the regulation in the United Kingdom is carried out by a number of regulatory bodies, which in some way reflect what occurs in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, if it can occur in the United Kingdom, it can certainly happen in Australia. There appear to be five main reasons why #800m could be stolen from the Maxwell superannuation funds. First and foremost is that the United Kingdom, like Australia, relies on so-called trust law. Trust law is not codified. It has its origins in seventeenth and eighteenth century British law where trustees were appointed to handle usually the supervision of property or estate. Trust law was not designed to handle the supervision, management and investment of major proportions of the accumulated savings of the economy, and particularly in the form of pension funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whenever attempts in the United Kingdom were made to codify trust law, various members of the superannuation industry vehemently opposed any codification of trust law. This was the major flaw that allowed the pension funds from the Maxwell funds to be stolen. The various pension fund trustees were totally dominated by Maxwell. His will prevailed absolutely. In fact, when only one trustee, a Scotsman&mdash;who, unfortunately, I was unable to meet and who was a union nominee&mdash;dared to question what Maxwell was doing, he was removed from  the  trusts  and  also  lost  his job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Maxwell did was to ask and obtain the permission of the various trustees who were administering the various funds to place the handling and investment of the assets in his own investment company. He had delegated to him from that investment company&mdash;along with members of his family who are to face trial&mdash;absolute power to invest those moneys. That is how he was able to steal the moneys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are four other reasons why he was able to get away with this. The second reason is that the Occupational Pensions Board, which is required to receive annually reports from the various pension funds, did not, we believe, receive sufficiently detailed audited reports. This then leads us to question the role of auditors. What were the auditors of the funds doing when reports were being handed on to the Occupational Pensions Board which were giving the various pension funds the okay?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other regulators include an organisation called the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation. It was supposed to be regulating and supervising Maxwell's investment company. It has admitted itself that it was not doing the job it should have done for a variety of reasons, not least of which was that it did not have sufficient power or sufficient staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth reason for the Maxwell fraud was the diverse regulatory regime in the United Kingdom. If we think things are complicated in Australia, we should realise that a vast array of different laws and government organisations are responsible for pension supervision in the United Kingdom. There is the Pensions Scheme Office, the Department of Social Security, the Occupational Pensions Board, the Treasury, the Security and Investment Board, the Investment Management and Regulatory Organisation and the Pension Ombudsman. The Inland Revenue and the EC also have some involvement. If we think things are complicated in Australia, where we have the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the Reserve Bank, the Trade Practices Commission and the Industrial Relations Commission, we must remember that things are certainly a lot more complicated in the United Kingdom. There were diverse regulatory organisations which, frankly, were not doing a terribly good job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth reason for the Maxwell fraud was that there was poor reporting to the members of the funds. Unlike in Australia, in the United Kingdom they do not have the requirement for very detailed annual, and in many cases six-monthly, reports to members which are mailed to the members and outline where moneys are being invested and a variety of other issues. They are the five reasons why the Maxwell fraud occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, when I was in the United Kingdom some two weeks ago, it was the first anniversary&mdash;if, indeed, we can refer to it as an anniversary&mdash;of the Maxwell fraud. In that last year there has been a massive turnaround in the attitude of the superannuation industry to regulation. Even whilst I was in the United Kingdom at a number of seminars and conferences, the industry itself admitted that self-regulation has been an abysmal failure. It has called on the Government to act and introduce a variety of regulations to regulate superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the mess of the Maxwell fraud will take some years to sort out. Again, this highlights the difficulty of resolving disputes over superannuation in the courts of law. As I mentioned earlier, it will take three to four years to find out who owns hundreds of millions of pounds stolen from the funds and, secondly, it will cost a lot of money to do that. Already the legal and administrative bill for sorting out who owns what in the Maxwell pension fund is #30m. It has cost over $A60m so far to determine who owns some of these Maxwell funds. There are another three or four years of court proceedings to go, so I do not think it is being too imaginative to claim that it will take perhaps $A100m to $A200m to sort out who owns what in the Maxwell pension funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While all this is going on, not only is it costing a lot of money, but also the 32,000 pensioners who have lost at least half of their moneys have to wait and wait until they find out what their final pension payment will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been the response of the Government in the United Kingdom to this absolute disaster? There have been two responses. I would have to say that one of them was fairly quaint, and if it were not such a serious situation, it would be half amusing. The British Government appointed a lord&mdash;and I forget his name&mdash;to go around to the financial community to voluntarily collect moneys to assist in making up the #800m that was stolen. It is a rather quaint response, because at the last count he collected some #6m. I believe credit should be given where credit is due, because the collection of #6m is a good effort in the circumstances. But to rely on this sort of procedure to compensate persons whose superannuation moneys have been looted when #800m is needed, clearly will not be a sustainable way of compensating persons who have had money stolen in the event of theft and fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second response of the conservative Government is to establish a committee known as the Pension Law Review Committee, chaired by a Professor Goode. I had the opportunity to visit Oxford University, where the professor is based, and to speak with him about his Committee's work. Interestingly, the terms of reference of the Pension Law Review Committee encompass many of the terms of reference of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. Professor Goode is extremely interested in the reforms being carried out in Australia and will be visiting here next February to talk to a variety of people, including regulators, about the recent announcements and the various changes that have been made in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my conversations with the various members of the industry in the United Kingdom&mdash;much of it was confidential because there are ongoing court cases and disputes over this case&mdash;I learnt that there has been a movement away from self-regulation towards the industry itself calling for appropriate safeguards to protect fund members against theft and fraud. In one year there has been a massive turnaround in public sentiment and industry sentiment. The changes that will be made will be based on the Goode Committee's recommendations, which should occur by the middle of next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This case highlights the dangers in Australia with the massive amounts of pension funds flowing into pensions. At present the figure is some $150 billion. It will rise to some $600 billion by the year 2000. One of the reports of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation involves safeguarding superannuation. I have not had the opportunity in the Senate to speak on this issue since I have returned. The Government, to its credit, has picked up many of the recommendations in that report. I will not go into that in detail today because there will be legislation in the future picking up the Government's report. Suffice it to say that the Government has recognised the fundamental flaws that existed in trustee law and is proposing to codify much of trustee law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is beefing up the powers of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to make it into a single, effective regulator. It is providing additional staff for the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to do its job. It is beefing up the requirements of trustee supervision. It is also ensuring that auditors perform their role properly. It has ensured already, through other mechanisms, that there is effective reporting to the members of superannuation funds. Finally, the Government has announced that it will provide a compensation mechanism in the event of theft and fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the lessons have been learnt in the United Kingdom. We are very fortunate that we have not had the same level of fraud in Australia. This Government&mdash;credit where credit is due&mdash;has accepted most of the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee and will make superannuation a much safer and more reliable investment mechanism for Australian citizens. That is only as it should be, given the huge funds that are flowing into superannuation following the passing of the superannuation guarantee levy legislation earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the superannuation seminar that was held by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. The report is well worth reading. There were some very interesting and controversial suggestions about how to deal with consumer issues. I believe, together with my colleagues on the Senate Committee and in the Secretariat, that it is yet another very useful paper that has come from the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise to speak in response to the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and its Schools Council to the report of the task force on a broadbanded equity program. In November 1991 the Government requested the Schools Council to provide advice on the shape and structure of a broadbanded equity program for schools. The Schools Council was to advise on the possibility of amalgamating several programs into one broadbanded equity program. These programs were the special education program, the country area program, the disadvantaged schools program, the English as a second language program, and the hostels for rural students program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case for the amalgamation of these programs relies on the benefits which are seen to flow from giving school systems and/or schools the ability to determine their own priorities within an agreed framework. A broadbanded equity program, it was said, could reduce submission writing and focus attention on the overall progress of the disadvantaged groups. In this document, the Schools Council notes that schools around Australia are seeking in various ways to combat the negative effects of poverty and other forms of disadvantage on learning and the school experiences of many students. It is unfortunate that these schools are really combating the failed economic policies of this Labor Government, which continues to create poverty and disadvantage, placing a greater burden on schools and making equity programs even more vital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This advice to the Minister from the Schools Council also mentions the great contribution that is made by individual parents and teachers who are strongly committed to a variety of programs. It says that this contribution is of central importance. Why then does this individuality and flexibility, which is working so effectively, need to be centralised under one administrative body or protected by continuing government controls over the allocation of funds to these programs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council also notes that it feels this could best be resolved through the careful allocation of roles and responsibilities between schools, school systems, authorities and the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, the Council does not outline what form these roles and responsibilities should take or how these responsibilities are to be defined. The Council notes in this report that the concept of monitoring and reporting for the programs requires the commitment and cooperation of all government and non-government school authorities. What could easily happen is that we could just end up creating more bureaucracy and wasting resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council says that it wants to provide more flexibility for schools to develop their own strategies while at the same time more easily meshing their approach with the Commonwealth's equity program. They say that they want a strong, national approach. However, if they succeed, they will choke and stifle the fine individual efforts made by the very parents and teachers whom the Council has complimented for their dedication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main direction of the policy advice in this document is to propose a centralised solution to a problem that needs solutions generated at the school level by those who know best&mdash;the parents and the teachers. It would seem logical then that the Council should recommend decentralisation rather than the formation of more centralised bureaucracy, as proposed in this response to the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to support the Regulation of Video Material Bill 1992, which was introduced by Senator Walters. Senator Walters, who has long been a champion of this cause, introduced a similar Bill in 1988. I supported the original Bill and I am pleased to be able to support her again on this issue. As a mother and grandmother, any issues which affect women and families are of the highest priority. This issue should be of the highest concern to all women and families throughout Australia. The decision by this Government three years ago to defeat Senator Walters's proposal was a blow to women and families not only in Canberra but also throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this Government has made a sham of looking after families. It has given in to yet another minority, the pedlars of pornography&mdash;an industry which makes money out of exploiting women and which caters to the more perverse elements in society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators opposite talk about civil liberties, the rights of people to do what they wish and to pursue a normal successful life to the best of their ability. I ask honourable senators: what could be a greater infringement on the rights of the majority of average Australians than the sort of dangerous material we are talking about today? What could be more harmful to the pursuit of those aims?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need is control over the distribution and content in X-rated, R-rated and M-rated videos. Senator Walters's Bill deals with the prohibition of the importation, sale or hire of X-rated videos and the reduction of violence in R-rated and M-rated videos. Decent families, church groups, women's group and many other organisations have been crying out for firm action to be taken to stamp out this smut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only last month I made a speech during the adjournment debate on this very issue. That speech was the result of representations made to me as a matter of urgency by a number of parents in the Toowoomba region. They are concerned about the increasing use of pornography in our electronic media. Members of St Theresa's parish council in Toowoomba wrote to me and said that they had had complaints from people of all ages who felt that primarily the Australian electronic media was acting to destroy all forms of decency and morality. There is no doubt that this is a real problem. It is something that we really need to be very concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988 the Joint Select Committee inquiring into video material tabled a report containing about 30 recommendations. There were two areas of particular concern to the Committee regarding content: firstly, the strength of the violence in videos and, secondly, that X-rated videos were degrading to women and should be abolished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the tabling of the report, Australian Attorneys-General met and, as a result of that meeting, a unanimous agreement was reached between the State Attorneys-General. It was agreed that most Australians wanted X-rated and excessively violent videos to be outlawed and that the way to accomplish this was to have a national approach on the issue. This was necessary because, while all the States had for some time banned the sale or hire of X-rated videos under their jurisdiction, the Commonwealth had refused to do so in the Territories. This resulted in the free trade of these videos being carried out between the States and Territories, so thwarting the States' legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Federal Government refused to abide by the combined decision of the Attorneys-General from the various States. The situation still exists where, because the Australian Constitution allows free trade between the States and the Territories, the various States' legislation is overridden. As a result, X-rated videos are freely available for distribution and sale from Canberra. There is evidence readily available to show that these types of videos have a detrimental effect on our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are here for the good government of the nation and if we are not doing that we should not be here. I dispute the spurious arguments put by the Government that a ban on X-rated videos will drive them underground. That is a hoary argument put up by people who deliberately do not want the best for the community. We should remember that murder is done in private. Does that mean that we should legalise it so that it can be brought into the open? As a society, we closely follow what we legally permit to be viewed on television and videos. There is concern amongst many people that what is privately viewed today by adults in their own homes will ultimately be shown in public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us here today are parents. We realise that as parents it is difficult to control what our children watch and see during their daily activities. I am very concerned that many young people watching explicit sexual material as well as violent material may come to believe that such behaviour is acceptable. Indeed, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has raised his concerns about the problems of violence on television programs and the difficulties faced by parents in deciding whether programs are suitable for their children. Of course, this is more or less what this whole Bill is about and I believe it is something we should all be very concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we do not want to spend too long on this Bill in view of the fact that we still have to deal with Appropriations, but certainly I hope senators will support this Bill. If it is defeated, it will be a matter of effectively pushing the pornographic industry onto the 99 per cent of Australians who do not want to view these films. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certainly concerned at the proliferation in today's society of what could only be described as anti-family behaviour and material. I have stood up for the family many times in this chamber, but I do not think I have ever been more worried about the future of families than I am today. Families are the cornerstone of society. They form the basic structure on which we build our lives. In order to maintain our way of life, health, safety and order we must protect the interests of the family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who oppose this Bill can only stand condemned for their weak-kneed position&mdash;a position which is no good for women, no good for families, no good for children and no good for Australia. This Government abrogates its responsibilities to the community when it relies on Senator Walters to introduce this Bill instead of taking action when it could. If we truly support the concept of families as the basis of society, we will protect and preserve them by voting for this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend Senator Walters sincerely for bringing this Bill into the Senate. We will vote to reduce the violence in M and R rated videos and to prohibit the importation, sale or hire of X rated videos. I indeed commend the Bill to all honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to begin today by saying that I believe the basic intention of what Senator Walters is proposing is reasonable. Indeed, I think she should be congratulated on persisting with this issue and for spending many years particularly on the violence issue. It is one that is now to the fore in the media. I do not think there is anyone in this place who has the slightest doubt that the community is getting heartily sick and tired of violence, is demanding some action and some changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community will now no longer tolerate sexual violence, particularly on television but also on film and video. I think it is also fair to say that the classification system being used for this type of material is far from satisfactory. Certainly the system we have at the moment does not provide a reasonable guide to the actual content of the material. Parents have great difficulty in knowing whether a film is suitable for their children to see simply by looking at the classification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly very healthy to see this debate back on the political agenda, in particular the aspects involving sexual violence. It is also now back on the political agenda. As we saw yesterday, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) are trying to outdo each other in their calls for controls over violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chief Censor has agreed that research shows that the community is concerned about violence in the media and that their main concern was directed towards violence on television. There is also a legitimate concern about the links between violence, particularly explicitly sexual violence, in film and video material and violent crime. Despite some exaggerated claims from both sides of the argument, the research that has been done needs to be noted. There is certainly evidence that viewing such material directly triggers violent behaviour, specifically in those people with psychiatric and other problems. It seems clear that sexually explicit or violent video material can generate aggression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if such direct links can never be conclusively verified, I think we do have to acknowledge the debilitating cultural and social effects of incorporating these sorts of violent and degrading images into our mainstream media. We then need to make decisions about whether or not we censor television programs and film and video material and, if so, what sorts of standards we want. What sorts of guidelines should we be putting in place? What sort of protection in particular should we be offering our children&mdash;not just children but teenagers in very sensitive years? What sort of material should we be accepting as suitable for them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some very forceful arguments put by the anti-censorship lobby, especially in relation to film and video, but as a community we have already made a decision. We are going to censor; we already have a censorship system. So really the debate has gone beyond whether to censor or not to censor and has moved to the realms of how we censor, the actual level of censorship, and the way in which the categories are to be stipulated and set out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before talking further on censorship, I want to look at the three distinct types of material we are talking about. First, there is violent material. This sort of material can emerge in varying degrees in virtually every classification we now have, from G through to R; though I fully agree with the Prime Minister and others who have identified high levels of very realistic violence in M rated films as the greatest cause for concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is material which is sexually violent. It is this material which, rightly, is of the greatest concern to the community. Strictly speaking, depictions of sexual violence are only permitted under the R classification which is restricted to adults over the age of 18, in theory at least. It certainly seems to me that some M rated material is a cause for concern in this area. Explicit or unjustified depiction of sexual violence against non-consenting persons supposedly led to this type of film or video being banned altogether, but obviously this is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as I can see, part of the problem seems to lie in the fact that we have no fixed legislation or definition of what is unjustifiable or contextually justified. I believe we should move towards eliminating sexual violence altogether from film and video material altogether. Unfortunately, Senator Walters's Bill does not do this, but this type of violence certainly should not be turning up on television in M-rated films or on videos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there is sexually explicit but non-violent material. This sort of material is the subject of a great deal of hysteria and moral judgment dressed up as argument. When I have reread some of the letters I have received from people on this matter, I have found that clearly they do not understand the difference between the X classification and R. Indeed, in some cases they believe that X classification automatically means sexual violence. This is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They seem to suggest that X is automatically worse than R and that X is our major problem. Indeed, one writer went to the point of saying that they understood that sexually violent material was in the X classification. I remind honourable senators that that is simply not the case. X rated material, which is restricted to adults over 18, covers `explicit depictions of sexual acts between consenting adults and mild, non-violent fetishes', to use the exact definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that no depiction of sexual violence, coercion or non-consent of any kind is permitted under the X classification in contrast to what the current `R' classification is where depictions of sexual violence are acceptable if they are `necessary to the narrative and not exploitative', whatever that means. This is where the heart of our problem lies. It is pretty obvious that X rated material is not generally especially tasteful and much of it does not put forward positive images of women, or men for that matter. But no matter how personally repugnant we find certain aspects of it, let us be very clear about it: it is not violent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simply not the case to say, as some have said, that the feminist movement is 100 per cent behind attempts to take out that X rated classification. Both here and overseas the feminist movement is divided on this issue and not all are opposed to this particular type of video or film. There are many women involved with and supportive of the feminists against censorship movement who have allied themselves with free speech advocates. Their arguments are that the feminist anti-pornography message is being used to restrict and distort female sexuality and that conservative morals campaigners have co-opted anti-pornography feminists to make their agenda more `modern', and so more acceptable to the general public. We can probably argue about that for decades and it certainly is not the item before us today, but let us not have this continual misrepresentation about the women's movement being unanimously behind the anti-pornography movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Joyce Sanders, writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on 18 April 1992, I believe, hit the nail on the head when she said:</PARA>

Could it be that the local family video store is peddling the violent smut while the restricted adult shop provides the non-violent sexual expression between equal adults?. . . Could it be that the corner newsagent can sell to any age child a motorbike magazine extolling gang rape along with magazines with ads for Big Bird products on the back and young women with their legs spread on the front, while magazines depicting two adults engaged in the natural non-submissive sex that we all aspire to are restricted to over-18 shops with blanked-out windows in industrial areas?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, when did what I thought was normal, everyday run-of-the-bedroom sexual activity become prohibited, and that which I thought would have been banned 20 years ago become the norm?</PARA>
<PARA>Joyce Sanders goes on to describe how she hired three R rated films, one of which she had difficulty in understanding how it could ever have been classified at all, as it contained considerable sexual violence, mostly against women, and with a very graphic death. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Miss Sanders put in a call to the Film Censorship Board. She found that what gets an X rating is sex with no violence and, as she said, the normal body parts that we all have in action. What gets an R rating, and can then appear in the local video store is, in her words, all the perversion of sex, enhanced by death and mutilation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The censor assured Miss Sanders that sexual violence was only allowed when it was an integral part of the plot, and here we come back to the problem; this, indeed, brings us full circle. We do not have an adequate classification system which gets specific about what level of sexual and other violence we will allow on television and in films and videos. I stress again that, unfortunately, Senator Walters does not cover this in her Bill&mdash;this issue is not properly addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need is just one classification system for television, film and video. It has to be a system that is easily accessible to the general public; a system that is easily understood by parents and, indeed, adults when they wish to make a choice of the sort of film or video that they want to watch or hire. Perhaps now would be an appropriate time to move our amendment to the second reading. Accordingly, I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At end of motion, add ", but the Senate notes that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)the classification systems for television, video material and cinema films need a thorough overhaul; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)as part of that process, the classification systems must be co-ordinated so they are the same for all television, video material and cinema films, and classifications must be designated to ensure easy community understanding".</PARA>
<PARA>We need a specific set of guidelines and criteria. They need to be far more specific than those in this Bill. I cannot see this Bill having any great effect on the content of film and video material. Firstly, despite what is said, particularly in the explanatory memorandum, the Bill does not change all that much as far as violence goes. Secondly, the Bill perpetrates the current problem of vague language, and I will be more specific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walters's new M rating is not permitted to include sexual violence, and that is already the case with the present M rating, although it is not as clearly spelt out. Her new R rating could imply moderate sexual violence only to the extent that it is necessary to the narrative and is not exploitative. Current R rated material may depict sexual violence only to the extent that it is necessary to the narrative and is not exploitative. The difference is between the words `imply' and `depict' and I presume we are to leave it up to the censor, and maybe the courts, to finally decide what the difference is between `imply' and `depict', and what is necessary to the narrative. As Joyce Sanders found out, if the plot is one of sexual exploitation, then almost anything fits that plot, and this is where the problem lies. It is very hard to separate out sexual violence if that is an integral part of the plot. Despite its good intention, I do not think this Bill advances the cause of removing or restricting sexual violence on television, cinema or video material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the Bill's efforts to ban X rated material, I am most concerned that as it is presently drafted it goes well past that stated intention. By defining explicit depictions of sexual activities so broadly, this Bill sets up a situation where material including virtually all depictions of sexual activity between consenting adults is banned. I find it extraordinary that it is really saying that it is okay to imply sexual violence in an R rated movie that may, in fact, still have a very violent connotation, as long as it fits in with the plot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we come to the committee stage of this Bill, I have to ask Senator Walters whether that is the agenda. I do not believe it is, but I think we do have a major drafting problem with this Bill as it stands. I do not believe the majority of people in the community support the final draft of this Bill as presented to us today. They certainly support the intention, but we have to be very clear, as we put legislation through this place, that the intention is clearly and precisely documented in legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the Government is concerned, I think it is most unfortunate that this has been left up to Senator Walters to pursue. I would have hoped that by now the Government would have moved. After all, as Senator Bjelke-Petersen has said, it is many years that Senator Walters has been pursuing this issue. I hope that very shortly, particularly after the meeting of heads of government in December, there will be rapid action by the Government to limit violence&mdash;in particular, sexual violence&mdash;in all areas of the three media. My final comment on this Bill is that in its present form it does too little in one area and goes too far in another. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak on the Regulation of Video Material Bill 1992 because I regard it as dealing with a most important matter. The question of the regulation of material that may be seen on television and in videos, and in films that may be seen in a cinema, has had a renewed life as a legitimate and proper question to be asked in the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not just a question of small or vociferous lobby groups trying to put their points of view. It is a question where now, quite clearly, there are grave misgivings within the whole Australian community about the adequacy of, and information purported to be given by, the various classifications and symbols which should enable people to make a fair judgment about the material which they hire or go to a cinema to view and&mdash;although it is not dealt with in this Bill&mdash;that they might see on television at various times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A survey has been done called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exploring attitudes towards film, TV and video classifications</EMPHASIS>. It is a marketing research report prepared for the Office of Film and Literature Classification and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal by Frank Small and Associates. When one reads it one sees that there is certainly a recurring theme. Even on the first page one reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The research has identified some opportunity to further maximise the usefulness and relevance of film and video classifications by making greater distinction between the upper and lower end M material. For sensitive people, in situations the broad range of material within the category works against the maximum potential usefulness of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>I find the editorialising about sensitive people quite gratuitous. The fact is that anybody is entitled to a clear definition, and fairly predictable content, of a category which is offered, particularly when one has the guidance of children by parents and guardians as a primary concern. That is part of what is meant to be achieved by the M category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has also spoken about the broad M category. I am quite sure that he would find much to commend on page 21 of this report which, once again, speaks of the broadness of the M classification. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that the broad range of material currently qualifying for M is working against the maximum helpfulness of the classification scheme. Material at the upper end of M can be at odds with the public's perception of the expectation of M. At this upper end there is some blurring between what the public sees as M and R.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once again, it is cast in a way which I do not believe does justice to the reality, as the upper end of M does shade into R. There are many instances where those in the community&mdash;for example, viewing <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Silence of the Lambs</EMPHASIS>&mdash;would say, `I saw that film, I thought it was a very good film, but to think that it was properly categorised as M was stretching that category to its maximum'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed that in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> John Hinde, the ABC's leading film critic, when asked how he would classify some of the recent blockbusters, of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Silence of the Lambs</EMPHASIS>, which is presently M, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This movie terrifies many adults, not just young people. I liked it a lot but I know many people who really hated it because of the explicit violence in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be classified an MA&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, A for adults&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">because even adults need to know that the violence&mdash;which even includes cannibalism&mdash;is of an extreme nature. It isn't a movie for children at all.</PARA>
<PARA>I fully agree with John Hinde in that regard. I believe that Senator Walters has indicated in her Bill that the division of the M category to more clearly define the lower and upper ends of that material, in the way that she has approached the matter, is coherent with the research that has been undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, the Prime Minister, in recent weeks, has been speaking of the violence portrayed on television&mdash;this is not directly related to the Bill&mdash;in timeslots when he as a parent would hope that his children could sit down and watch a film at 8.30 p.m. or a quarter to nine and not be presented with the sort of horrible violence which led him, as he told the Caucus recently, to turn off the television and have to deal with the usual trauma that follows when a parent does that. This led him to say that he would be consulting with the various players in the television industry to ask them to deal more sympathetically with this matter by moving the more violent type of material into 9.30 p.m. and onwards timeslots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we are dealing with the classifications for videos at the moment. I believe here again that what the Prime Minister said yesterday to the National Family Summit, convened by Ita Buttrose, is important. Amongst other things, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that all of us should be able to have confidence in the classifications system so that we are not taken by surprise by the contents of a film or a video.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is important to us as adults who want to decide what kind of entertainment we are paying for, but it is quite critical when it comes to choosing movies or videos for our children [to] watch.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the past three years the Office of Film and Literature Classification has enhanced the classifications by providing consumer advice for all films and videos.</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate there to say that what we are confronted with now is not merely a need for publication to enhance community understanding of what the various categories stand for; it is also not good enough that we rely solely on the injunction of the Attorneys-General as censorship Ministers, delivered in Cairns in July last year, when they indicated to the classifying authorities that they thought that in relation to violence there should be more stringent application of the top of the M category. Whilst it is said that those categories have been tightened up at that end, I believe it is no longer simply a question of tightening and more stringently applying present categories. There is merit in the suggestion that categories themselves need to be rethought. I am quite sure that lies behind the Prime Minister's remark that the M classification is far too broad&mdash;in fact, he called it `absurdly broad'. The Prime Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I find it difficult to accept the utility of a system which brackets "Crocodile Dundee" and "Cape Fear" in the same "M" category.</PARA>
<PARA>He said also that the M category was not even good enough to help identify violent films. He was also concerned, as are many parents, about coarse language or depictions of sex or drug use, which can also feature in the M category, and he suggested that there should be two levels in the present M category&mdash;the milder end and the more realistic or graphic end depicting violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister also made the suggestion, which is reflected in some elements of Senator Walters's Bill, that the purely advisory nature of the M category has exhausted its usefulness; that there needs to be, certainly in the upper end of the M category, a situation provided for where those who are selling or hiring videos or those who are running cinemas need to do so within a legal structure. This would mean that it would be mandatory to prohibit the availability for viewing or hiring of the upper end of M videos, or films in the case of cinemas, by youngsters, except perhaps in particular circumstances: for example, going to a film accompanied by an adult, which has been suggested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are difficult issues. There is certainly a need to deal with the categories&mdash;that is the merit of Senator Walters's Bill&mdash;but I am not convinced that the way in which Senator Walters proposes to do so will be an adequate response to the problem. I am not even talking of matters of definition that might be argued about in relation to one clause juxtaposed against another or against the present system, although there would be much to ask in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that not sufficient attention has been paid to the need within Senator Walters's Bill to recognise the very real function of the States and other jurisdictions in relation to these matters. That is why I do believe it is important that on the question of the concurrence and support of the State jurisdictions, the role of the States in the devising of any further and better categories of classifications has to be recognised and time given for the discussions and deliberations which have been foreshadowed by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the Prime Minister yesterday stated to the National Family Summit that he was proposing to ask his colleagues, the State Premiers and the Chief Ministers, to agree to list film and video classification as an agenda item at the meeting of the Council of Australian Governments to be held in Perth on 7 December. I believe that is very important because at the moment the classification system rests on the foundation of an intergovernmental agreement between the Commonwealth, States and Territories and is oversighted by a ministerial council&mdash;the Standing Committee of Censorship Ministers&mdash;which, generally speaking, consists of the Attorneys-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The laws relating to the exhibition of films and the enforcement of conditions placed on the exhibition of films lie within the legislative control of the States and the Territories. In relation to videos, the intergovernmental agreement, under the Standing Committee of Censorship Ministers, deals with the classification of videos by recognising the ACT ordinance, except that the States do not recognise X. Once again, the laws relating to distribution and enforcement of conditions relating to distribution are uniquely within the legislative powers of the States and Territories. Whilst certain steps can be taken by the Commonwealth with regard to classification, I believe the actual implementation, enforcement and adoption of the various classifications will fall to the legislative powers of the States and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existence of those very powers therefore requires that the matter be fully debated and discussed by the Prime Minister, the State Premiers and Chief Ministers in Perth on 7 December within the forum of the Council of Australian Governments. This is an important and proper step to be taken. It needs to have the highest possible political consideration within that forum. Therefore, I believe that this Bill is premature in regard to that discussion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill has a principle underlying it which can command concurrence and can be accepted, the major one being the difficulty of seeing the blurred difference between films and videos classified as M or R. To that extent,  the Bill deserves commendation, but overall it has come at a time which is out of kilter with the proper discussion that has to take place with the other Australian jurisdictions which have a very real role in relation to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that Senator Lees has circulated a second reading amendment indicating that the classification systems for television, video material and cinema films need a thorough overhaul, that as part of that process the classifications systems must be coordinated so that they are the same for all television and video material, and that cinema films and classifications must be designated to ensure easy community understanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first part of that particular addition to the second reading motion unquestionably is correct and deserves support. The second part could also be supported, though once again that has to tie in with so many complex questions of timing and viewing schedules and slots within the television presentation that by itself the simple adoption of similar or identical classification would not necessarily answer the question whether we were doing the right thing by the community. There has to be a very close wedding of the classifications to appropriate timeslots, which will be the subject of the discussions by the Prime Minister next week with the television authorities and, I think, proprietors and managers of the major television networks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reading debate is a useful one and I look forward to hearing further contributions to that debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support what I believe is the intention of the Regulation of Video Material Bill. I also support Senator Walters's concern about the influences of the visual material which is freely available within our community. I also know that the community is confused about the M, R and X categories. Senator Tate spoke about the stretching of categories, the blurring at the edges of categories and the alterations which people such as Mr John Hinde would like to see or would argue for. I am also confused about those things and I would not pretend to have the capacity to debate one way or the other the M, R or X classifications, what they meant and where they ought be. I think categories are necessary as guidelines for potential viewers, whether they be young people or adults.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard Senator Tate speaking about the film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Silence of the Lambs</EMPHASIS>. I saw most of that film; it was on our television while I was painting the lounge room. In between trying to get everything right, I glanced over and had a look at it. I found it to be a very complex film, one on which one had to concentrate to understand its context. The word `context' has been used a fair bit here already. I dare say that it will be used considerably more before we resolve this problem. The visual images with which the viewer is presented when watching that film are nonsense unless the viewer had concentrated on the film and followed why certain things were taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A film which I paid a great deal of attention to&mdash;my wife and I actually went to the cinema to watch it&mdash;is called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistlestop Cafe</EMPHASIS>. Another honourable senator recommended that I take myself along and watch it for relaxation. I cannot remember what category it fell into. It was certainly not rated R or X. Whatever category it was in, very early in the film I was quite shocked by a very violent incident. A young man had his arm taken off by a train. Another man was killed by a train. I found that shockingly violent. It disturbed me and my wife while we were watching it. The context of that scene explained much of the rest of the film. Without seeing that particular event, much of the rest of the film would have been nonsense, or at least subsequent events would not have made sense easily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also found parts of that film to be quite sinister. Although the film itself was shot in what I believe was the sunny south of the United States, a fair bit of it took place in the dark. There were some mysterious figures moving around committing violent murder and escaping detection for much of the rest of the film. In fact, the mystery was not solved at the end. There were hints at what the solution might be. While it was not sinister, there were scenes in that film which could have been disturbing without understanding the context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the film was not rated R or X. I do not know whether it was the upper shade of M, as Senator Tate talked about, or whether it was more appropriately called something else. It also had humorous events in it and it was very complex. I would have found it difficult to decide whether my 15-year-old daughter should watch it. All in all, the enjoyment that I got from the film&mdash;my wife shared this with me&mdash;was such that I would have made my own category. I think a paragraph would be required to explain what the film contained, what would be particularly important to look for and which bits we had to make sure we watched so that we could make sense of it. Of course, we cannot include a paragraph from individuals alongside every film to give it an accurate rating, but this shorthand that we have devised has become quite inadequate for the purpose of recommending that people of a certain age go to watch films. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that I am trying to make is that the present categories are inadequate, as has been outlined by Senators Lees and Tate already, and that I agree with Senator Walters that those categories need a jolly good shake-up and revision. How we do it and what comes out the other end is a very complex matter. I hope as a parent that the young people who are guided by us can be guided by our interpretation of the ratings. At the moment, I find that those ratings give me very little cause for confidence. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of film critics and eminent psychologists and experts in the science of learning and the area of education have worked out that young people these days&mdash;those who have been exposed to television and a variety of films&mdash;have a greater sophistication at an earlier age than did previous generations.

Senator Kemp will be interested to know that I have thought about this matter to the extent that I recall the very first speech I made in this place, and I will stick to the theme which I raised on that occasion. The innocence of children is a guidance to us; it is something which we should treasure. The great poet, Wordsworth, was able to detect this theme and make it a very important component of his work. It is not simply the assertion or the belief he had that the child is father of the man. Rather, as children we are innocent of the world's terrors and the world's garbage. As adults, in acquiring maturity, we acquire some of the blackest garbage that mankind has been able to assemble and perhaps we are better off without some of that because it does obscure our vision; it reduces our capacity to see some of the beauty that is around us. </PARA>

This is very much a matter where we are asked to put on display those things that we believe in and the values which we think are important to preserve and to do something about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Context is so important when we are dealing with film classifications; context is also very important when dealing with matters such as this. Senator Tate mentioned a context which was to do with timing and other matters and events which are taking place. I do not agree with Senator Tate that this Bill is premature and that it should wait until after the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) talks with the States. I do not believe that this Bill is out of kilter with any community discussion; it is in fact at the heart of community discussion right now. I do not think, because of those considerations, it should be held up; the community discussion should catch up with this Bill. This community discussion was brought to us over the last few days via our fax machines and our mail boxes, and also, in my case, via my flower arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate is happening&mdash;it has to take place. We have to look at this Bill and what it is trying to do. It is important that this debate be conducted; we should not be distracted from it. There is the urgency of government legislation. There is the urgency of any number of things. But to me, as a parent, and as an individual, this matter has waited long enough. The Bill is here, we need to discuss it and we need to keep on discussing it until we get it right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with Senator Lees that it is a matter for which Senator Walters has had responsibility for some time, but I do not think Senator Walters should guard this responsibility and keep it to herself. I do not think that is what she intends. I do not think she should be saddled with the responsibility of incorporating all the fine nuances of the debate into this Bill. But&mdash;and here is the but&mdash;the Bill itself needs the consideration of this chamber. We have it before us now and we should look at what we can do to ensure that this event occurs. Senator Lees has moved the second reading attachment as an amendment. I thoroughly agree with that, and I think that is precisely what should be done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend Senator Walters for her expressed concerns about the levels of violence and for her concern about sexual violence in particular. We have worked together on the Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Telecommunications Technologies. I like to think that perhaps, in at least an indirect way, the work of that Committee has assisted in helping to educate and to alert the community to the general levels of concern that exist about violence in media, film and video.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in considering the Regulation of Video Material Bill, we have to be careful to ensure that we get our facts right about what material is in particular classification areas. While I support Senator Walters's explanatory statement that there is a need to reduce the level of violence in M and R rated videos&mdash;wherever violence is debated, I think Senator Walters and I will be in agreement&mdash;I remain to be convinced about the second part of her Bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to prohibit the importation, sale or hire of "X" rated videos.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a lot of misinformation about X rated videos. I suppose this is because many people know about X rated videos but they do not view them because that is their choice not to be involved in the mail order system. I get a lot of letters from people saying that they want X rated videos banned. Perhaps if we were living in a perfect world, I might agree with them. But we live in a far from perfect world and, while X rated videos are not something that I want to involve myself or my family in, I am not convinced that banning them is the answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage it might be worth reading into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record the precise definitions of the three categories that we are referring to. The classification of M states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">M  Mature (Recommended for mature audiences 15 years and over)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Material which is considered likely to disturb, harm or offend those under the age of 15 years will be classified `M'. While most adult themes may be dealt with, the degree of explicitness and intensity of treatment will determine what can be accommodated in this classification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Language:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Crude language may be used, but not when it is excessive, unduly assaultive, or sexually explicit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sex:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sexual intercourse or other sexual activity may be discreetly implied or simulated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Violence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Realistic violence of medium intensity may be depicted, but violent depictions with a high degree of realism or impact are acceptable only if contextually justified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Drug use may be depicted, but not in an advocatory manner. Supernatural and "horror" special effects usually warrant an `M' classification.</PARA>
<PARA>On reading that definition of M, I think that we would all agree with Senator Walters that there is a need to re-examine the degree of what receives an M classification. I support the notion of having two categories within the M classification so that we can highlight the violent material and that can be separated, particularly for the sake of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us next look at the R classification, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">R (Restricted to adults 18 years and over)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Material considered likely to be harmful to those under 18 years and possibly offensive to some sections of the adult community warrants an `R' classification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Language:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are virtually no restrictions on language in `R' films.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sex:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sexual intercourse or other sexual activity may be realistically implied or simulated. Depictions of sexual violence are acceptable only to the extent that they are necessary to the narrative and not exploitative.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not accept that at all. Again, I agree with the intention of that section of the Bill. Who decides that sexual violence is acceptable? Who decides whether that sexual violence is necessary to the narrative? Who decides whether it is exploitative?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walters, Senator Harradine, others in this chamber and I have debated this issue with the Office of Film and Literature Classification on a number of occasions. We have questioned who is making these determinations on the basis of the selection of the board members and whether they are truly representative of the Australian community. The R classification further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Violence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Highly realistic and explicit depictions of violence may be shown, but not if unduly detailed, relished or cruel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Drug abuse may be depicted, but not in an advocatory manner. Extreme "horror" special effects usually warrant an `R'.</PARA>
<PARA>In regard to those two areas, I certainly see there is a need to fully examine the classification system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now let us look at that very controversial area of X rated material. I certainly would not want it to be suggested that I am endorsing X rated material. I find some of the X material that I have seen offensive, but I am not convinced that banning it is the answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the X category and what it actually involves. It is not violent. It may be offensive. It may be morally concerning to many people in the community&mdash;and I respect their views. But I want to say again and again that X rated material is not violent. The X classification states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">X (Restricted to adults 18 years and over)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No depiction of sexual violence, coercion or non-consent of any kind is permitted in this classification. Material which can be accommodated in this classification includes explicit depictions of sexual acts between consenting adults and mild non-violent fetishes.</PARA>
<PARA>In actual fact, I would prefer X rated material to be categorised as non-violent erotica. Then we would all know what we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people in the community, including myself, are not accepting of non-violent erotica or wish to see it. But I do not believe that banning non-violent erotica is the answer to the fundamental issue that we are all concerned about in the community&mdash;and Senator Tate detailed surveys that show that it is violence that the majority of Australians are concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will re-emphasise what is refused classification, because I still get letters from people saying that this sort of material is somehow classified by a wicked Federal Government; it is not. Any film or video which includes any of the following is refused classification: first, depictions of child sexual abuse, bestiality or sexual acts accompanied by offensive fetishes or exploitative incest fantasies; secondly, unduly detailed and/or relished acts of extreme violence or cruelty and explicit or unjustifiable depictions of sexual violence against non-consenting persons; and thirdly, detailed instruction or encouragement in matters of crime or violence, and the abuse of prescribed drugs. So those areas are off the agenda and are refused classification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I endorse some of the comments of Senator Bell in speaking today on the Regulation of Video Material Bill 1992. I am glad that we have a sensitive new age man in our midst. I liked his comment that the innocence of children is worth preserving, and I noticed everyone in the chamber nodding in agreement. It is our concern for children that has motivated this debate; certainly it has motivated Senator Walters. I believe that it is the fundamental issue upon which Australians are seeking our action in protecting our children or, as Senator Bell so admirably put it, preserving the innocence of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Australian community has demonstrated in recent extensive surveys that its major concern is the culture of violence. I support the personal efforts of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in focusing attention on limitations on violence shown on television, and especially the screening of adults-only material after 9.30 p.m. I certainly hope that he is successful in persuading the network chiefs to rearrange their programming so that adults only material will be shown after 9.30 p.m. It seems perfectly logical to the majority of people who are concerned with family viewing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, I welcome the Prime Minister's identification of the fact that there is such a broad range of films and videos acceptable within the M category. At the National Family Summit yesterday, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I deplore the amount of violence on television able to be watched by children but I am also aware that the problem of unsuitable programs for children is not confined to television. There are also films and videos, many of which contain material relating to sex or drugs which I regard as unsuitable for children to watch.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister has acknowledged that the present classification system is much too broad&mdash;Senator Tate, Senator Walters and others have identified this&mdash;and has pointed out that, since the setting of these classifications is a Commonwealth-State matter determined by the Attorneys-General as censorship Ministers, he will be listing film and video classification as an agenda item when the Premiers and Chief Ministers next meet on, I believe, 7 December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walters can take heart from the fact that there is considerable cross-party support in relation to violence. I will now elaborate a little on this culture of violence and where it comes from. My comments may be regarded as offensive to the United States, but so much of our media is dominated by the culture of American violence. I am sure that honourable senators could identify material from other countries, including Australia, that is also excessively violent, but one would have to agree that America has an addiction to make-believe violence. It is an addiction; it takes more and more to accomplish less and less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An article from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newsweek</EMPHASIS> identifies the fact that, in 1987, in a film called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">RoboCop</EMPHASIS> 32 people were killed throughout the film, but by 1990 a sequel served up 81 corpses. The makers of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Die Hard 2</EMPHASIS> in 1990 really outdid themselves. The number of people killed rose from 18 in the original film to a body count of 264. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all familiar with this excessive picture of violence from so many American film-makers. I have said before, without much success, that we often talk about quotas in other areas of government activity. I wish that we could put quotas on the amount of violent American film and video material that is coming into this country. This would mean not, as Senator Walters says in the second part of her Bill, banning it but putting quotas on the amount of violence that this country will accept. Perhaps we could even debate how much of the same American rubbish that is pornography should come in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the same <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newsweek</EMPHASIS> article, the director of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Silence of the Lambs</EMPHASIS> straddled the old and the new by taking a gruesome plot and filming it with a certain amount&mdash;according to this article&mdash;of discretion and taste. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"We wanted to exploit people's endless fascination with scary stories&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I think I could write a few scary stories that did not go as far as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Silence of the Lambs&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and provide them with a tremendously powerful version of a scary story, but we didn't want to upset their lives," he explains.</PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But people <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">are</EMPHASIS> upset by the assault of brutal imagery on radio, TV, in the theatres, in best-selling books. It is not any one film or program that is singularly disturbing; it is the appalling accretion of violent entertainment. It is the sense that things have gotten out of control. And there is legitimate alarm at what all this imaginary violence might be contributing to an increasingly dangerous real life.</PARA>
<PARA>There are numerous other references to this culture of violence and the violence that is dominating so much of the American culture that we absorb in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, a newspaper article quotes a Mr Robert Ressler, who is now retired from the FBI's violent criminal apprehension program. He claims that society&mdash;and he means American society&mdash;has an infatuation with violence and human annihilation and with breeding monsters, such as confessed mass killers and mutilators. This is the sort of material that we are allowing to proliferate within Australia. Perhaps if we were a little more regulatory in the amount of Australian material that is shown on television and in our theatres, we could at least partially overcome some of this obsession with violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A newspaper headline on Tuesday, 8 September 1992 reads, `Bishop condemns US obsession with violence'. The heading of another newspaper article reads, `US violence the ``worst on earth''.' This article continues:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report depicted Americans killing, raping and robbing one another at a furious rate, surprising every other country that keeps crime statistics.</PARA>

<PARA>The article says further on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Violence against women in the US was even more pervasive, the committee said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rape rate was eight times higher than in France, 15 times higher than in England, 23 times higher than in Italy and 26 times higher than in Japan, according to the report.</PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Walters points out in her explanatory notes, Australia cannot derive any comfort from where it stands in relation to rape statistics. The point I want to make relates to how Australians are influenced by this domination of American culture in this country. I believe&mdash;although Senator Walters may regard this as a little outside the scope of the debate&mdash;that this is an issue that we should seriously address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is something radically wrong with our classification system. I am quite amused that it has taken John Dickie some time to come to the opinion that is reported in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">News Digest</EMPHASIS> where he has decided to give approval to the Prime Minister's proposals for a new classification system. With every respect to John Dickie, I ask: where has he been for the years that this debate has been going on? Where was he when we banned a suicide book? Yet we continue to allow into Australia the kinds of videos that reflect an American lifestyle and an American preoccupation with violence and opposition to gun control. What is the Office of Film and Literature Classification doing? It is banning <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fatal End</EMPHASIS>, a book on suicide. Clearly, there is a double standard there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my remaining 10 minutes I wish to address the issue that I thought Senator Lees raised in a very responsible way. There are people who are really not prepared to seriously address the question of pornography and whether it is harmful. I do not know the answer. I wish I did. Debating these issues and deciding legislation and film classifications would be made much easier if only that vexed question could be answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote from a paper presented by Dr Thomson at the Victorian Criminal Justice Council Symposium which was held last year. Sections of the paper raise a number of issues which Senator Walters has indicated she is concerned about. The paper does not come down on one side or other of the debate, but it does show that it is very difficult to pinpoint precisely what pornography does. The paper states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pornography is a subject which elicits deep moral and ideological divisions within our society. There are those who believe that pornography corrupts the minds and morals of the viewers and is responsible for an upsurge in sex offences and violence against women. Many who hold this belief argue that it is appropriate and justifiable that pornography should be banned or at least severely restricted.</PARA>
<PARA>I guess I would come into the latter category; it should be severely restricted. The paper continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are others who hold that no link between pornography and violence has been established&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>although clearly the other side has not established that there is not a link between pornography and violence&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and that in the absence of this link greater violence is done to society by restricting an individual's right to read and view what he or she wants.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Thomson outlines the conclusions that he draws from the findings of different kinds of research. We know that researchers like statistics because they can prove whichever their particular point of view is, depending on which research or statistics they quote. Dr Thomson tries to be objective in this paper and tries to determine whether pornography is harmful and how harmful it is. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conclusion I draw from the findings of the different lines of research is that pornography is causally related to sexually violent behaviour. Whether or not sexually violent behaviour is initiated after pornography is viewed depends upon the following circumstances:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)The attitude of the viewer to women.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)The extensiveness of exposure to a significant level of pornography.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)The degree of empathy the viewer has with other people.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)The extent of moral constraints or inhibitions possessed by the viewer.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)How quickly the opportunity arises to act out sexual activities.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6)The degree of violence depicted in the material.</PARA>
<PARA>As I have already said when outlining what X contains, there is no violence in X. Dr Thomson goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps the only conclusion that can be drawn with any degree of confidence from these studies is that pornography depicting sexual violence sexuality arouses violent sex offenders more than non-sex offenders and non-violent sex offenders. Various researchers have found that a significant predictor of sexual violence against women was the degree of hostility held about women. The effects of pornographic material were found to interact with the degree of hostility towards women.</PARA>
<PARA>One might ask: where does this leave us&mdash;to ban or not to ban? I believe that prohibition has never solved the problems that arise in a democratic society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can sympathise with those who say this behaviour and material and these videos ought to be banned. I can sympathise with that view, but clearly there is no evidence that prohibition solves society's problems. It is a bit like saying, `Let's bring back capital punishment and these despicable crimes of violence will be eliminated'. There is no evidence that that is so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summing-up: this Bill is very important, because it raises the issues and debate on them. The Prime Minister has indicated that the classification system does need an overhaul and I welcome that. I welcome John Dickie's final recognition of that fact. I certainly hope that in that reclassification we will also get a more representative group of people making assessments about some of the material which has been categorised in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the second part of Senator Walters's Bill, I cannot support a total prohibition because I am not philosophically convinced that prohibition is the answer. I am certainly interested in anything that keeps us looking at ways to reduce violence. That is the focus of the Australian community and it should be the focus of this debate, rather than being distracted into talking about sex and X rated material, which I again emphasise does not contain violence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish in this debate to address the Regulation of Video Material Bill 1992 which has been introduced as a private member's Bill by Senator Walters. It is a considerable disappointment mainly because it conveys to me a dreadful confusion between matters of sex and matters of violence. To pick up on the last comment made by Senator Reynolds, it has always been difficult to try to convey to the community that the X rated category separates violence from sex. It is absolutely imperative that people understand that, although it has been very difficult to get that vital message through to the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet in Senator Walters's Bill that confusion between sex and violence is not clarified or removed but indeed, it seems to me, is made worse. In addressing the issues of sex and violence in this Bill, Senator Walters has quite clearly in the early classifications watered down the amount of violence but not removed it. In fact, she has retained words like `sexual violence'. I find it surprising that Senator Walters, who has been such a strong antagonist in these matters, consistent and clear in her view, has produced a Bill that contains a confusion. In fact, so far as I am concerned, these classifications only further muddy the waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walters has always had a very clear view as conveyed in this chamber and other places. I am surprised that she retains in her Bill some of those descriptions or `descriptors' that seem to me to perpetuate precisely the sorts of things that I understood she opposed. I would not want to say that this confusion is mischievous, but I might perhaps wonder about that since the categories as drafted in this Bill appear to muddle up the two issues of sex and violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that the Bill minimises or reduces violence in the classifications M and R&mdash;a point that on the face of it I would want to agree with; but it very much depends on how those classifications are drawn and exactly what the terms are&mdash;I cannot take any comfort from the Bill's classifications. I would have no trouble at all in standing or voting to support a further reduction of violence and a clarification of the classifications of violence. But at the same time I have all the trouble in the world with the banning of X rated movies, videos and films. Again there is this confusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us would want to support a reduction in violence, but a lot of us do not see any evidence at this stage to lead us to vote against X rated material&mdash;even though we may be totally turned off by it or quite unpersuaded by its virtues. So for both reasons, both within the definitions and within the broad thrust of this legislation, I think Senator Walters has managed to confuse two issues to the point where I could not support this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In case I read anywhere that anyone takes this as meaning that I am a wild protagonist of pornography, I make it absolutely clear that he or she has got it wrong. The reason I would support an X rated classification is an understanding I have about respecting the rights of people who have different views. If they want to look at material like that and if it is clear that that is not going to damage society or them or other people, then I will not stand in their way. I may not like carrots, but I cannot stop other people eating them&mdash;at least until we find out something else about carrots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I think I heard Senator Reynolds saying that the evidence of the impact of pornography on people who watch it is very difficult to establish precisely and exactly. So for a variety of reasons my view is that, while I do not like it at all, I will not move to ban it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also go on to say that if I were serious about doing something about this, then I would not want to vote for a private member's Bill, particularly one that is unlikely to pass in the House of Representatives, and particularly one that will not therefore effect any changes. It will allow debate on the issues, but it will not make any difference in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I do support is what this Government is doing. I refer to the stance taken by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the statements he has made about this issue, and the quite clear commitment by Government to have discussion about what sort of violence will be shown in films on our television and at what hours that material might be shown. If we look at breaking the M classification into subheadings and make quite clear to the film and video industry the restrictions on who can see those different new classifications of violence, then I think that will make the sort of difference that this legislation, if passed, might purport to be making. So that is another reason that I do not support this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to use words like `political stunt', although I believe that other people have in other places. As I said earlier, Senator Walters has always been consistent in her position. What I think people might regard as a political stunt is that she would want to effect a change by way of private member's legislation.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The members of the Film Video Coalition have been invited to respond to the Prime Minister's censorship initiative and a detailed response will be submitted in time for consideration at the Council of Australian Governments meeting on 7 December.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general, the Film Video Coalition is pleased to see the legitimate concerns about censorship being addressed at the highest level of government and the community for the first time in many years. The Film Video Coalition is also aware of the problem of the M classification and agrees with the Prime Minister's assessment that the classification is too broad. Consideration has been given to the way in which comparable countries, including the UK, the US and New Zealand, deal with this issue. The objectives of the Film Video Coalition and the Government are broadly the same&mdash;that is, to maintain the integrity of the censorship classification system so that the community can be confident that movie theatres and video stores are safe, responsible family entertainment centres.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a press release in support of the Government's initiatives and the Government's action that I think a lot of people might not have expected. In other words, such support was unlikely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, the Film Video Coalition is saying that it welcomes the legitimate concerns to address censorship at the highest level of government&mdash;and by the community. We know that the community has grumbled along and, from time to time, led the debate and discussion on this issue of concern to it. But at the highest level of government&mdash;that is, our Prime Minister&mdash;there is a commitment to seeing something happen, to seeing some change, to seeing some clarification of the issues of a new breakdown of the M classification and of a restriction of 15 years in that area. These are the sorts of things that will only assist the Film Video Coalition because it will be able to be clearer and it will be more confident that when people come to purchase or hire its members' wares, there will not be any confusion or doubt about what they might find there. I think one would have to say that that is a very heartening media release from a quarter where, as I say, people may not have expected to get that support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next thing I would like to read is a press release from, again today, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> under the heading `TV violence'. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australians have always been a tolerant race opposed to heavy-handed censorship, but the increasing depiction of gratuitous violence on TV and in films, often linked with explicit sexual scenes and drug abuse is causing many parents to question previously liberal attitudes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of such scenes on young children can only be guessed at. Certainly society is hardly becoming less violent because of them. Prime Minister Paul Keating gets high marks for keeping the issue in the public spotlight. It was heartening to see most of his concerns echoed by the Federal Opposition. State and Federal leaders have the ideal opportunity in their December meeting to standardise film, TV and video classifications. The community has a duty to protect vulnerable youngsters from any danger whether it is on the screens or on the streets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A headline from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> of Friday, 6 November read `PM hits TV movie violence' and another in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of Friday 6 November read, `PM tells TV networks: spare our children'. A headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 12 November read, `PM to keep adult films from teen viewers'. This headed an article supporting the steps taken by the Government, led by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating draws attention to the problem of exactly what is film classification. This article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 12 November reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier in the day, Mr Keating said he had no confidence in the film classification system and believed the mature audience category for 15- to 18-year-olds should be split into two sections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The category was `absurdly broad' because it included films ranging from family entertainment movies such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Crocodile Dundee</EMPHASIS> to violent thrillers like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cape Fear</EMPHASIS>. . .</PARA>
<PARA>I think all of us would say that if both of those movies can be put into the one classification, we are talking about an extraordinarily broad range. I think it is quite clear that the community makes a very clear distinction between those movies. One does not need some particular expertise, although one needs some clarification of the definitions. The community is quite able to make those distinctions, but, unfortunately, not until they have seen the movies they relate to. If people want to be guided, particularly in regard to what their children might see, they need that advice before the film is shown, not after they have seen it. So we need a classification system that is consistent and that does make a distinction between such films as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Crocodile Dundee</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cape Fear</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the particular area emerging that the community is so concerned about is violence. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 12 November reported: `The PM wants violent M-rated films banned for under-15s'. Again, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> reports the lead by Prime Minister Keating on this issue. One can be sure that the Prime Minister's promises will be carried out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable senators want to see action in this very important area, they will back what the Prime Minister is doing, rather than support this private member's Bill, particularly as it contains the confusions I alluded to first of all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be quite clear, too, that the Prime Minister has the support of the community in making this stand. I am not going to read all of the letters&mdash;or even a significant sample&mdash;that have been flooding the Prime Minister's office since he made his statements about this matter, but one of the letters reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Prime Minister,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to congratulate you on your forthright comments regarding violence on television and young children's exposure to it. I too have noticed the trend towards more violence in movies and series on television, especially on the commercial channels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One particular which aspect I find distasteful is violence towards women. Your proposal for the ABT to require violent material to be screened after 9.30 p.m. will go some of the way towards addressing the problem of children being exposed to violence on television. I hope it also includes advertising material.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe commercial channels do not take their responsibilities seriously. They have the power to influence social attitudes and behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Like you, I am a parent of four children and I have always monitored their viewing, especially during school holidays. Thank you for voicing the feelings of, I believe, the majority of responsible parents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA>Another letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Keating,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My husband and I have just watched and listened to you on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>. We want to congratulate you and back you concerning violence on TV. We agree wholeheartedly. We have four children ourselves plus I am a year one teacher in a Catholic school. In both cases, 1: parents have an uphill battle convincing children that violent shows are not suitable. 2: I am aware of children in my class who are six years old and who stay up and watch some of the movies, for example Police Academy, because in this less than perfect world there are parents who allow their young children to do so. Well done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA>Phone calls have also been coming through&mdash;messages that can be summarised essentially as follows: `would like to express appreciation to the Prime Minister as a parent in regard to your statement on the programming about violence in TV'. The community support is there; the political will is there; the Prime Minister's commitment is there. We have the film and video industry's commitment to cooperation and response. We have a very clear understanding that the time is right for a clarification of the classifications for making distinctions in that M classification that is at the moment, I think, too embracing by including films over too wide a range of violence in particular. I think with all of that coming together at this one time, we have an opportunity to see very significant changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I say that I do not believe that supporting this private member's Bill, confused as it is, will in any way effect any change, let alone the sort of change that will happen through supporting what the Prime Minister and the Ministers Council will able to achieve later this year. That is not to say, of course, that this opportunity to debate the issue is not a useful contribution to a range of views on this topic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walters seemed to want to disagree earlier with my claim that her M classification would not include depictions of sexual violence of any kind. But clause 5(6)(c) states `may include simulations of moderate levels of violence if, and only if, contextually justified'. I know that those are the words that are in the current Bill and I have to say that, whether they are in Senator Walters's Bill or the current Bill, I do not know exactly what `contextually justified' means, but it is open to a very broad understanding. If it has a special in-house coded meaning then, of course, the legislation is not open to ordinary reading by ordinary citizens. </PARA>

Is Senator Walters establishing a new category? Or have I got the wrong piece of the Bill here? I will read it:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subject to subsection (8), video material classified as the category under paragraph 5(1)(f):</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">may include simulations of moderate levels of violence if, and <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">only if, contextually justified.</PARA>
<PARA>If I do not understand correctly that those are to be categorised together, I would like to know why not. Any ordinary reading of (a), (b) and (c) under the one number would suggest that they were of the one category. My good colleague Senator Lees nods that I have a fair and reasonable understanding of that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say again, the point at which Senator Walters jumped in and took issue with me was when I used the words `contextually justified'. They are open to enormous interpretation. Contextually justified&mdash;that can be used to justify just about any violence one likes. Do we want to say that a war film would show violence because it is in the context of a war, and that within the context of war we can show all the other violence within that film? Contextually justified&mdash;it is a very loose classification. Indeed, it is exactly the sort of problem that has led to the problem under M at the moment. It is very difficult to be clear about what `contextually justified' means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, if one takes (c) in Senator Walters's Bill, she has actually watered down the amount of violence that may be shown, contextually justified or not. If she means to say that she does not want gratuitous violence, violence over the edge or out of the blue, and that whatever violence is there must be within context, I take that as an acceptable point. But `contextually justified' is also open to the interpretation that if the context is set up, one can justify the violence, and that is the concern that a lot of us have and have always had. As I say, I think Senator Walters would have much more support if she had left out the concern about X rated and sex, and devoted more effort to what is the very strong message in the community about reducing the violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been any number of questions to Minister Tate on violence in our community&mdash;a huge inquiry into violence. We also understand just how very extensive domestic violence is. Yet until very recently we have not addressed how some of those things in society&mdash;for example, the violence which is shown on our televisions, videos and film screens&mdash;may be part of a web. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe any of us can say that it is directly causal because I do not believe that evidence is there. It is true that most people who watch that violence do not go out and commit violent acts, but it is also true that it creates a climate where violence becomes acceptable. That is one of the things that certainly worries me a huge amount. I would like to see more messages that say to society that violence is not acceptable. Violence is the way of resolving any kind of problem when one cannot think it through or talk it through. It is the action of the inarticulate. I do not believe that, even without arguing causal contribution, we should be encouraging that climate of violence in our society which, inadvertently perhaps, but quite clearly, allows a tolerance of violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not without relevance that the rules of rugby code removed a lot of violence from its sport. I love it when the rugby sports people say, `There has never been any violence in rugby, we have removed it all'. That is one of those lines that rugby people have to say on occasions, and I think it indicates that they know there was an unacceptable amount of violence in their sport. They have made huge efforts to remove it. We see that violence has very much dropped out of that sport. I am not able to say, because I was not watching it too much a decade or two ago, but I am advised that there is a very much reduced amount of violence in that sport. I do not know that one could say there was none left, but those in the rugby code themselves knew that what was happening in that sport was no longer acceptable, not even on the sporting field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To have people who could step on to the field of sport and thrash and bash each other, and then come off the field and be told that violence was not acceptable, was sending very confused and mixed messages. Our sporting organisations know that violence in the sporting arena may contribute to that climate of violence. They are taking steps to minimise or reduce it. It seems to me to be perfectly consistent that our video, television and film industries should also be contributing to reducing that climate of violence on our screens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to what Senator Walters's classifications are. Paragraph (7)(b) says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">may imply moderate sexual violence only to the extent that it is necessary to the narrative and is not exploitative.</PARA>
<PARA>I am stunned that Senator Walters, who has given me to understand that she does not like the depictions of X rated material at all&mdash;was absolutely appalled at the mixture of sex and violence&mdash;is, in her draft Bill, including those words in a category under paragraph (7)(b):</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, it is in R now, I can tell Senator Harradine. If Senator Walters is introducing a Bill to modify, minimise or reduce it, but she has consistently said she opposes sex and violence together, then I am saying, merely for the record, that I am surprised to find that she has left those words as a category within this Bill. Senator Walters may well argue that that is because she is a reasonable person, and is not into total banning. Let her explain it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned about the implication of sexual violence in Senator Walters's Bill. It is one of the problems that concerns many of us who are concerned about increased violence. I have just read a letter from one of the citizens in this country written to the Prime Minister. The letter says that one of the things the writer particularly dislikes is the portrayal of violence against women and, for the large part, sexual violence in our films and on our TV screens is against women. I have to record my amazement that Senator Walters has allowed this continuing classification in her Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, it is useful that we have the opportunity to debate this issue in addressing Senator Walters's private member's Bill. The debate has turned out to be very timely because of its relationship in time to the initiatives taken by the Prime Minister. I hope I have made it clear that I cannot support this Bill because of what I see as a real confusion within it between sex and violence within both classifications and the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I cannot support it because if I were serious about being effective and effectual in getting changes in our society to this climate of violence, all I would have to do is support the initiatives&mdash;the moves already taken&mdash;and the stance by the Government and its commitment to see that the M classification and the 15- to 18-year-old requirements are changed. Those will happen. They will make the sort of difference that I think Senator Walters properly is aspiring to in this private member's Bill. I do not need the Bill, I will support the Prime Minister. </PARA>

Senator Crowley has the effrontery to suggest that this is a political stunt by Senator Walters. That is an affront. I know the work that Senator Walters, together with other honourable senators from both sides of this Parliament, has done on this issue, and it is a disgrace to suggest that it is a stunt and meaningless and doomed to failure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is Senator Crowley saying that if the Regulation of Video Material Bill passes this chamber, not one of the Labor members in the House of Representatives will vote for it? Is she saying that not one of the Labor members of the House of Representatives will vote against X rated videos? As for videos classified as X, clearly the confusion is in the minds of Senator Crowley and, I beg to say, Senator Lees. There is considerable confusion about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer honourable senators to the contributions that I have made in respect of this matter. All they need to do is to put the key words into their computers. I invite them to consider those contributions in the areas of violent material, PG, M and R material. I will not bother the Senate at this time with the questions that we have asked constantly of the Film Censorship Board and the Office of Film and Literature Classification about tightening up the guidelines. Despite all the cries throughout the community, those guidelines have, in effect and in most cases, been loosened and not tightened. I invite honourable senators, if they are interested, to have a look at the questioning of Mr Dickie and Mr Haines from the Film Censorship Board and the Office of Film and Literature Classification during the deliberations of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Telecommunications Technologies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me come to X rated material. This debate is not about taste. It is important that we are clear about the nature of the video material&mdash;X rated video material&mdash;which is the subject of this debate. It is not typically material which is simply gratuitous in regard to sexual matters to the extent that it is crude, tasteless and vulgar rather than pornographic. Nor is it video material which includes simulated dramatic depictions of sexual acts in the development and treatment, whether serious or humorous, of themes involving human sexuality which in context and intent are not pornographic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The video material with which this debate is concerned can properly be described as non-violent, degrading pornography. In fact, it is hard core pornography because X rated video material is described officially by the Federal Government, in its explanatory memorandum to the ACT ordinance, as hard core pornography. Although that ordinance has gone over to the ACT Assembly, it is still hard core pornography. That is what this Government described the material as&mdash;hard core pornography. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the words of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material, X rated videos treat women `as sexual commodities to arouse the sexual desires of its target audience' and `reduces persons to objects or occasions of sexual pleasure'. The Film Censorship Board's bland description of material contained in the X classification fails to convey the exploitative and degrading nature of X rated material which promotes sexually promiscuous behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence cited by the majority of the Joint Select Committee shows that such material engenders a `sexually calloused and manipulative orientation towards women'. It mediates in the minds of the habitual viewer a perception of women in general as being highly promiscuous and available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that at least four behavioural scientists whose research was submitted to the Committee saw non-violent pornographic videos as more harmful in this regard even than the violent explicit pornography which has already been banned. The Joint Select Committee on Video Material stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women are often depicted as sexually malleable for the purposes of satisfying male sexual desires. This is sometimes manifested by themes involving workplace sexual favours.</PARA>
<PARA>Of considerable interest to me, as one dedicated to upholding civil liberties and human rights, are the observations of Emeritus Professor Zubrzychi, previously of the ANU, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> shortly after our report in July 1988. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pornography functions quite similarly to anti-semitic or racist propaganda: it serves as a tool of anti-female propaganda . . . The intent of all three is to distort the image of a group or class of people, to deny their humanity, to make them objects of humiliation, to use them for whatever purpose.</PARA>
<PARA>Every time that Senator Walters&mdash;or, indeed, the States&mdash;does something, this Government says that people are confused out in the community about the nature of X rated videos. The fact is I am not confused; Senator Walters is not confused. I invite anybody up to my office at 6.30 and I will show them what X rated videos are, and I will ask them whether they do not agree with the comments I have just quoted from the Joint Select Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now come to the rub. Senator Tate says that this is not the appropriate time; the States have to be consulted. What did the Government do in November 1988, after the meeting of the State Attorneys-General and the censorship Ministers with the Commonwealth censorship Minister? The States in fact said that they did not want X rated videos. The Government decided to establish a working party on videos. That was a sham because it never met. It was a public exercise to camouflage the Federal Government's continued legislative support for the hard core porn industry. That was against the express and unanimous wishes of all the States of the Commonwealth and the majority of the Joint Select Committee which had studied the matter over a period of three or four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision then was an insult to all the State Ministers. The excuse by Senator Tate tonight to Senator Walters is, `Don't go ahead with your Bill because we are having a meeting of the States with the Prime Minister'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the evidence which came before the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Telecommunications Technologies and all  the evidence that has come before us in the past says that people become desensitised by a continual diet of violence. When we see it day after day, we all become desensitised. We all know that; it has happened to all of us. We know how well it happens to all of us with language. I do not at all doubt that the evidence that was given before the Committee was perfectly accurate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been told that there must not be as much violence shown on the television news. I agree with that. If this Bill is passed, a message will go to the television stations and they will have to start looking at the amount of violence they presently show. Evidence has come before us that one in five men in Australia think it is all right to use physical force against their spouse. In my second reading speech I referred to a case presided over by Judge Mathews. It was a tragic case involving a dreadful murder committed by a 19 year-old youth who, prior to committing the murder, had been watching a very violent, but M rated, video&mdash;one that, according to the Government guidelines, is meant to be suitable for 15 year-olds to watch. Judge Mathews said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not in a position to suggest any measures which might have been taken to prevent this tragedy or which might be taken to prevent a similar one in the future. Clearly, a free and open society requires that there be freedom of communication. On the other hand, I cannot help wondering what benefits society can derive from having such a mindlessly violent film as this generally available to be viewed by anyone, no matter how disturbed he or she may be. The potentially devastating effects can be seen in the events of 27 February.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think anyone in this chamber disagrees with that sort of suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has suddenly become interested in the matter. I do not say that in a cynical fashion. Senator Tate said that the Prime Minister walked into his home one night and found his children watching something very violent. If the previous Prime Minister in 1988 had allowed his Party to vote in favour of my Bill, Mr Keating would not have had to turn off television in his home last week. It is as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The party to which Mr Keating belongs refused to allow my Bill to pass this Senate in 1988-89. That party refused to acknowledge how much violence there is in the community. The Prime Minister has now suddenly become interested in it, but he is only interested in what children are viewing. He is not interested in what is available to adults in the R rated category or the upper violent sections of M rated material. Indeed, he said in his speech at the National Family Summit:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not trying to restrict what adults can watch.</PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday during Question Time he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not about telling Australians what they can watch; I am about seeing it categorised properly and having the proper timeslots on television.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Prime Minister is only interested in what children watch, not in what adults watch. Indeed, a little later in Question Time he said that Dr Hewson had suddenly become interested in the subject. We know that members of the Opposition have been interested in this subject for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees said that she had hoped the Government would move. So did I, and I am disappointed that it has not done so. A trends and issue paper released by the Institute of Criminology contains an international survey which shows that Australia ranks the highest of 14 other jurisdictions with similar justice systems in the categories of assault using force, burglary, car thefts and minor sexual assaults. We were third highest in respect of rape. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to Senator Reynolds, the blame lay in the influx of American material into Australia. I do not agree with her. There is something wrong in our country and it is time we did something about it. Senator Reynolds said that she does not believe in X rated material being banned. She said that prohibition has never worked. I know Senator Reynolds very well. I have sat on a committee with her for so long that I know she does not mean that. I am quite aware that she agrees with the prohibition of child pornography. I am well aware that she would be horrified to think that we did not have a prohibition on child pornography. Yet she says that prohibition never works and that that is why she does not want X-rated material prohibited. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will amend the taxation laws to implement a further measure outlined by the Prime Minister in his "One Nation" statement of 26 February 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The offshore banking measure will promote the development of a viable offshore banking centre in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to this "One Nation" initiative, the Bill will amend the capital gains tax provisions to clarify the operation of subsections 160M(6) and 160M(7) of the income tax law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also reduce the rate of late payment penalty in the taxation laws to reflect lower market interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also proposes to extend eligibility for a rebate of income tax to recipients of a textile, clothing and footwear special allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also proposes to make minor technical amendments in relation to the tax treatment of disability support pensions, special needs disability support pensions and bereavement payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to a more detailed discussion of the major measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Offshore banking units</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Prime Minister's "One Nation" statement the Government announced its intention to tax income derived by offshore banking units (OBUs) from borrowing and lending to non-residents at a concessional income tax rate of 10%.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After extensive consultation with the Banking and Finance industry, the Government has decided to extend the scope of the activities, the income from which will attract the concessional tax rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry strongly argued that viability of an Australian offshore banking regime depended on Australia's ability to compete on an even footing with other countries in our  region that already provide a broad range of concessions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is in general agreement with this view, subject to certain measures being introduced to ensure that Australia's domestic revenue base is protected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The OBU activities that will be subject to the new rules cover all significant transactions sought by Industry and the Government believes that they will be well received.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the concessional activities can be classified as either financial intermediation between non-residents (including foreign branches of Australian residents) or the provision of financial services to non-residents in respect of business that would not ordinarily have a connection with Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr. President, the Government is confident that this measure will promote the development of a viable offshore banking centre in Australia at a time when such activities are likely to be shifted from Hong Kong to elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Development of offshore banking in Australia will also help to integrate Australia more closely with the Asian-Pacific growth economies by becoming an expanded financial centre of the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The direct cost to revenue of the measures is likely to be around $30 million in a full financial year from 1993-1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is possible, however, that additional revenue from business which is not presently conducted in Australia will offset this cost to some extent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Capital Gains Tax</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The broad scheme of the capital gains tax (CGT) provisions is that capital gains made upon the realisation of assets are included in assessable income and subject to tax. However, subsections 160M(6) and 160M(7) of the Income Tax Assessment Act are intended to assess certain capital payments not received in respect of the actual disposal of assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The subsections have been the subject of much comment since their introduction, and have recently been considered by the courts which have not sufficiently clarified their meaning and application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises that their application needs to be clarified and has decided that the law should be amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments are designed to clearly state the manner in which the new provisions will apply. Due to the extent of the commentary on the existing provisions, a draft of the amendments has been discussed with tax representatives of the legal and accounting professions with the view of ensuring the desired clarity is achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, the amendments will set out a scheme for the taxing of capital payments not received in respect of the actual disposal of assets. Where a taxpayer creates an incorporeal asset (such as a right under a restrictive covenant agreement) in another person, any consideration (less incidental costs) received by the taxpayer for creating the asset will be a capital gain to that taxpayer. Subsection 160M(7) will have a residual operation to tax payments not received in respect of the disposal or creation of assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also make some technical amendments associated with the operation of subsections 160M(6) and 160M(7).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments are not expected to have any significant impact on revenue and will broadly apply to transactions entered into after today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Penalties for late payment of tax and related penalties</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As announced in the Treasurer's Press Release of 26 May 1992 on improvements to self assessment arrangements, penalty for late payment of tax is to be reduced to reflect lower market interest rates. The Bill will reduce late payment penalties from 20% per annum to 16% per annum, with the lower rate to be effective from 1 October 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment will complement changes in the law made recently by the Taxation Laws Amendment (Self Assessment) Act 1992. That Act split late payment penalty into penalty and interest components but does not take effect until tax in respect of the 1992-93 year of income is overdue. The amendments being made by this Bill will reduce penalty rates for earlier years of income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Textile, clothing and footwear special allowance</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill proposes to extend eligibility for a rebate of income tax to recipients of a textile, clothing and footwear special allowance. The purpose of the allowance is to encourage retrenchees of the textile, clothing and footwear industries to undertake training provided under the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Labour Adjustment Package.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present retrenchees from these industries who derive the allowance are not eligible for a rebate of income tax whereas other retrenchees of these industries who derive similar benefits under Formal Training Assistance are eligible for a rebate. The amendments, which will not significantly impact on revenue, will remove this anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill deals with three matters:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">first, the re-introduction of sales tax on swimming pools that are constructed in situ;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">secondly, a 12 month extension of the exemption from sales tax of ultra high frequency transmitters; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">lastly, a number of minor amendments to the new sales tax laws due to come into effect on 1 January 1993 to ensure they operate as intended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In situ swimming pools</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Earlier this year the High Court held that legislation purporting to impose sales tax on swimming pools constructed in situ was of no effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A result of this decision is that manufactured pools that are goods are subject to sales tax, while no tax is payable on pools constructed in situ.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conjunction with the other Bill in this package, the Sales tax Imposition (In Situ Pools) Bill, the Bill will remove the inequity by re-introducing sales tax on swimming pool, spa pool and hot tub shells that are constructed in situ.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A pool builder or owner-builder will be liable for sales tax immediately after construction of an in situ pool shell is completed if, in the case of a builder, the pool contract was entered into on or after 1 January 1993 or, in the case of an owner-builder, construction of the shell commenced on or after 1 January 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ultra high frequency transmitters</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure that the broadcasting equalisation program is fully implemented, the Bill will extend the availability of the sales tax exemption for UHF transmitters to 1 January 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minor changes</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Bill will also effect a number of minor changes needed to bed down the new law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes are explained in more detail in the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SALES TAX IMPOSITION (IN SITU POOLS) BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conjunction with the other Bill in this package, the Bill will re-introduce sales tax on in situ pools by imposing sales tax on swimming pool, spa pool and hot tub shells that are constructed in situ.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill proposes a significant amendment to the National Health Act 1953.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two main parts to the Bill. Firstly, a fundamental change to the payment scheme for Commonwealth nursing home benefits is proposed, to enable the recovery of overadvanced benefit. Secondly, the Bill proposes the introduction of a series of measures designed to further protect the rights of the Commonwealth and of purchasers when a nursing home is sold or transferred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nursing home funding system has always embraced an element of cost-reimbursement. That is, funds are advanced to proprietors during the year and then at the end of the year that advanced funding is acquitted against the costs actually incurred by the proprietors in providing nursing home care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This means that, where a proprietor spends less on providing nursing home care than was advanced during the year, the amount of unspent or overadvanced funding must be repaid to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By virtue of the existing legislation, such overadvanced funds are not legally characterised as debts to the Commonwealth and can only be recovered by an offset or "negative fee loading" to the approved daily nursing home fee and, by extension, the amount of Commonwealth benefit otherwise payable each month.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That amounts of overadvanced benefit are not recoverable debts has caused some difficulty. For example, where a proprietor accrues a liability to the Commonwealth for overadvanced funding and then sells the home, that proprietor cannot be pursued for the money after sale. Rather, the Commonwealth is obliged to recover the money from the benefit paid to the purchaser.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry is well aware of such arrangements and makes appropriate provisions in contracts for sale. Further, following an amendment to the National Health Act 1953 in the Autumn 1992 Sittings of the Parliament, financial information about a home can be disclosed to potential purchasers without having to rely on the co-operation of the proprietor to obviate the secrecy provisions. Purchasers are, therefore, generally protected and able to make informed decisions when buying a home. Nonetheless, problems still occur.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment changes the nature of the funding system so that the person who accrues the liability can be pursued for the money&mdash;overadvanced benefit will be legally characterised as a debt to the Commonwealth and will be recoverable through the Courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, this Bill only changes the system prospectively. Benefits paid prior to the introduction of this change are not subject to its provisions and the existing system of recovery by fee loading will continue to exist in respect of benefits paid up to 1 July 1993 and until proprietors' claims for funding for those earlier periods are finalised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are some other aspects to the current scheme which offer problems for both the Commonwealth and purchasers when a nursing home is sold or transferred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is, for example, no real requirement for notice of sale to be given by either party. Where the Commonwealth gets any notice at all, there may be little time in which to finalise funding for the home, determine overpayments, ensure that prospective purchasers understand the funding system and are as far as possible able to make an informed decision about their purchase and to do those other things to ensure a smooth transition in ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, the amount owed to the Commonwealth is not able to be recovered at the point of sale, but must be recovered from the purchaser after sale, although this will be partially addressed by the proposed changes to the benefits payment system already described.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill introduces a mechanism for the sale or transfer of nursing homes which addresses these problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proprietors, the vendors in the transaction, will be required to give notice of sale and will be deterred from completing the sale within 90 days of giving notice. Purchasers will also be required to give notice of their intent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The period of notice will enable the vendor's claims, books and records to be scrutinised so that, prior to completion, a fair estimate may be made of any overpayment and any anticipated fee loading which relate to the period up until sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to or at completion of the sale, the purchaser will be required to pay to the Commonwealth from the purchase price the amount of the estimated overpayment. Such payments will be deemed to be paid to the vendor as consideration under the contract of sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the amount paid by the purchaser is less than the estimated overpayment, the vendor will be required to make up the difference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any amounts paid by the purchaser or vendor prior to completion will be held in trust by the Commonwealth pending final determination of the overpayment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amount of any anticipated fee loading will be advised to both parties so that appropriate provisions can be made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Immediately after completion of the sale, the actual overpayment relating to the period up until sale will be determined. Any amount held in trust by the Commonwealth will then be acquitted against the actual overpayment. If a greater amount is held in trust, the balance will be paid to the vendor. If a lesser amount is held, the outstanding amount will be recoverable as a debt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This mechanism is also flexible enough to address varying circumstances. Three separate approaches are provided for three different degrees of notice of the sale: more than 90 days, less than 90 days and no notice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to imposing statutory obligations on both parties to a sale, as well as the Commonwealth, the amendments provide for the imposition of penalties for failing to comply with certain obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes afford greater protection of the rights of the Commonwealth to money owed to it, and the rights of purchasers to information about the home they are buying and to a home unencumbered by liabilities accrued by the previous owner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the House.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MIGRATION REFORM BILL</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 5 May of this year, during the debate on the Migration Amendment Act 1992, the Minister foreshadowed to the House that he would be recommending a comprehensive program of legislative amendments to ensure that our migration law is the best mechanism available to deal with current issues and needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Labor Government has already been the author of significant reform of immigration policies and laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1989 the Minister's predecessor, Senator Robert Ray, took a major step towards legislative implementation of the recommendations of the CAAIP Report. In spite of the 1989 reforms, a major issue confronting the Government is border control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are people who are intent on bypassing the established categories of entry into this country. Some do this by trying to avoid immigration processing altogether by arriving in Australia without authority. The boat people are a good example.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Owing to weaknesses which have been inherent in our migration laws for many years, these people are often successful. Many manage to stay here even though they do not fall within the specific visa categories, which is the only lawful way to enter and stay in Australia. At the very least, many manage to delay the substantive decision on their case and, as a consequence, their departure, by using the courts to exploit any weaknesses they can find in our immigration law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This must stop.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Migration Reform Bill currently before the Senate the Minister proposes a range of measures to enhance the Government's control of people who wish to cross our borders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill sets out more effective means of regulating entry, detention and removal of people who do not establish an entitlement to be in Australia. The reforms are complemented by an enhanced scheme of independent merits review rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, a primary objective of the Migration Act is to regulate, in the national interest, the entry and presence in Australia of persons who are not Australian citizens. The Government views it as essential that all provisions and policies under the Act be interpreted in a way which furthers this objective. An objects provision will be inserted in the Act to remind the community, the administrators and the courts of this intention. Under the reforms, a non-citizen will require a single authority&mdash;a visa&mdash;to travel to, enter or remain in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All non-citizens will be brought within the one visa system. However, limited categories of non-citizens, in particular New Zealanders, will still be able to travel to Australia without a visa and enter with the same degree of convenience as at present.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Upon arrival, all persons, including Australian citizens, will be required to present themselves for immigration clearance. Australian citizens will be required to use their Australian passport or other acceptable evidence of Australian citizenship when leaving or entering Australia. These measures will streamline identification of non-citizens entering Australia and will reduce the prospect of evasion of immigration controls.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, we have an array of laws which govern detention and removal depending upon how a person arrived in Australia. This is confusing to the public and administrators alike. The Bill will provide for a uniform regime for detention and removal of persons illegally in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non-citizens who are in Australia without a valid visa will be unlawful and will have to be held in detention. Unlawful non-citizens who satisfy prescribed criteria will be able to acquire lawful status and release from detention by the grant of a `bridging visa'. Bridging visas will not be available to people who arrive in Australia without authority. Depending on their circumstances, they will be immediately removed from Australia, or will be subject to detention until any claim they wish to make has been resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When a person who is in Australia unlawfully has exhausted all available application and merits review entitlements, the law will require that person to be removed as soon as practicable. Deportation will only apply in relation to the current "criminal", "national security" and "certain serious offences" categories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the measures that the Minister has announced so far will lead to greater precision in our efforts to control the border.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the reforms, decision-making procedures will be codified. This will provide a fair and certain process with which both applicant and decision-maker can be confident. Decision-makers will be able to focus on the merits of each case knowing precisely what procedural requirements are to be followed. These procedures will replace the somewhat open-ended doctrines of natural justice and unreasonableness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Reform Bill proposes significant extensions to the current system for review of migration decisions. Credible independent merits review will ensure that the Government's clear intentions in relation to controlling entry to Australia, as set out in the Migration Act, are not eroded by narrow judicial interpretations. Under the Reform Bill, the following people who are adversely affected by a decision will be entitled to independent merits review:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">on-shore refugee claimants</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">on-shore cancelled visa holders except those cancelled at the border</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">on-shore applicants for a visa except those detected at the border, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">an Australian sponsor of an off-shore applicant for a visa</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As now, people off-shore will not be entitled to merits review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A specialist Refugee Review Tribunal will be established to provide independent and determinative merits review of on-shore refugee status decisions. The Tribunal will be non-adversarial, operating along similar lines to the IRT, with power to hold hearings and record its decisions in writing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to briefly explain why the Minister is introducing these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Throughout his political life he has believed that government, working in partnership with the community can bring about change&mdash;change for the good and changes which make a difference to our society and how we view ourselves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For instance in 1990 the Minister consulted widely with community organisations on the new refugee determination procedures particularly the inclusion of a community representative on the Refugee Status Review Committee and the new natural justice procedures. At the time this decision was widely applauded. However, when we started seeing negative decisions coming out of the committee the goal posts suddenly moved. The Committee was branded as an arm of government, the Government was criticised as having a fixed view and the system was declared as being unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly when the Government acted quickly to introduce fast tracking of new refugee cases this was believed to be a good move. The fast tracking system has been a success and we are starting to see results. Amazingly, however, the Minister is now being criticised for processing some cases too quickly. The Minister rejects totally such claims about the Committee and the fast track processing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nearly three years ago the Minister also met with a group of people who claimed to support the Cambodian asylum seekers. They were lawyers, local politicians and community workers. They went to the Minister and said they were concerned with the way that the Department had processed these people's applications and asked that they be done again.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They also wanted the asylum seekers to be given access to legal representation. The Minister agreed to this request because he believed that it is better to make sure that the decision making is beyond reproach and open to scrutiny. In the spirit of that partnership the Minister allowed the community to be part of that process. But what happened? In some cases it took 18 months for applications to be lodged for these asylum seekers. While more boats arrived. And still the support groups asked for more time&mdash;and while they were doing this what of their clients? They continued to wait in the processing centres waiting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Enormous energy was put into making wild and fantastic statements about Port Hedland&mdash;often by people who had never been there.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tragedy is that people have continued to be housed in Port Hedland and Westbridge&mdash;unable to get on with their lives. At the same time some of those who are supposedly supporting them are more interested in making their reputations as human rights campaigners rather than assisting in a speedy resolution of their cases. During this period what sort of advice did they give their clients?&mdash;The Minister can't presume to know but wonders if they ever were honest with them, if they gave them realistic, practical advice or whether they were simply fodder for a noble crusade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some lawyers employed by the Refugee Council of Australia cared about their clients so much that they put up a sign on the door of their interview room which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Suicide is just one step away&mdash;you might as well jump now".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What sort of irresponsible, non-thinking person could in the first instance dream up such a slogan and secondly display it on the door of a room which was to be used by people who were going to seek that person's advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister's primary responsibility is to make sure that asylum seekers are treated with dignity and fairness. They have a right to expect their cases to be handled fairly and quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Minister cannot be held responsible for the actions of those who provide them with false hope and tempt them into taking drastic and futile measures such as hunger strikes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We must have a system that is clear, predictable and fair and that applies equally to all asylum seekers in Australia. Clients should know what is happening to them and should be able to make informed decisions about their claims and options.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposals dealing with refugee processing contained in this Bill further strengthen the procedures in two ways. They provide a fair system for the applicants and at the same time provide the necessary protection for the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the general migration area, the Immigration Review Tribunal will handle the expanded jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a small number of IRT or RRT cases where an important principle of general application is involved, the Principal Member of that Tribunal will be able to refer the case to a Presidential bench of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The AAT will provide guidance for primary and review decision-makers dealing with similar principles in other cases without the disadvantages of delay and expense associated with court appeals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes to the migration merit review system broadly accord with views which I have received informally from the Committee to Review the System of Review of Migration Decisions. The Minister established this Committee, chaired by a former Immigration Minister, the Honourable Ian Macphee, to consider the effectiveness of the merits review system introduced in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Minister has indicated, the Government wishes to make the application of the legal concepts of migration decision making predictable. Judicial review rights for decisions on the grant or cancellation of a visa will be set out in the Migration Act. Judicial review will only be possible after the applicant has pursued all merits review rights, or where merits review is not available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Grounds for review will include failure to follow the codified decision-making procedures set out in the Act. As the codified procedures will allow an applicant a fair opportunity to present his or her claims, failure to observe the rules of natural justice and unreasonableness will not be grounds for review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, another feature of the Bill should be noted. The Migration Act currently allows a visa to be issued to an accused person who is being extradited to Australia. This Bill introduces a broader scheme to permit entry of not only these people, but also others, such as key witnesses, who are needed before the courts. The scheme will also ensure that law enforcement agencies have made adequate arrangements for these people while they are in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the reforms set out in the Bill will ensure that the Government retains control of Australia's borders, whilst providing a review system at a reasonable cost. The measures will not only make the enforcement of Australia's migration law more effective, but will ensure that individuals are treated fairly and are not subjected to unnecessary restrictions or inconvenience.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Establishment of the RRT will cost $3.2 million in 1992/93. However, the RRT will provide credible independent merit review, with an anticipated saving of approximately $72 million over the next four years, from the expected costs for the existing refugee determination system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate and I present the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MIGRATION (DELAYED VISA APPLICATIONS) TAX BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Migration (Delayed Visa Applications) Tax Bill is part of the migration legislative reforms which will provide more effective measures to detect and remove non-citizens who are unlawfully in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A tax will be imposed on an application for the grant of a visa or entry permit to a non-citizen who has been unlawfully in Australia for 12 months or more. It must be paid before the visa or entry permit may be granted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tax is intended to serve as an incentive for persons to come forward at an early stage to regularise their status, rather than remaining unlawfully in Australia indefinitely. The tax will be $3,000 for each complete year of unlawful presence in Australia. This amount will be indexed for applications made after the 1992-93 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Persons recognised as refugees will be exempt from the tax. The Bill also provides for the Minister to exclude the tax where the Minister determines that payment of the tax would cause an applicant extreme hardship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prime objective is to deter people from remaining in Australia unlawfully, rather than to raise revenue. Thus it is expected that the Bill will have a minimal financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the House and present the Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DATA-MATCHING PROGRAM (ASSISTANCE AND TAX) AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Data-Matching (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 commenced on 23 January 1991. It provided for the establishment of a Data-Matching Agency to match data provided by agencies participating in the data-matching program with a view to detecting incorrect payments of Commonwealth benefits or incorrect provision of certain other Commonwealth services. It also provided for the detection of instances of tax evasion. Subsequent amendments clarified that the program could be used also to discover where certain people are not receiving Commonwealth assistance for which they may be qualified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Progress with implementation of the data-matching program has been slower than anticipated in 1990 because of a number of factors including the time it has taken to allot a Tax File Number to every recipient of Commonwealth assistance, a prerequisite to the full scale operation of the program. Despite this the program generated savings of $25.3 million for the Department of Social Security alone in financial year 1991-92 and is expected to generate savings of $146.9 million for the Department of Social Security in 1992-93.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Data-Matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 provides in section 21 for the cessation of the data-matching program on 22 January 1993. This sunset clause was included to allow a review of the operation of the Act after it had operated for a time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill provides for the extension of the sunset clause and the consequent continuation of the data-matching program for an additional year. I believe that experience with the program for the best part of two years has shown that, while for the reason outlined,  early savings have been less than anticipated, substantial savings will be generated by the program with, at the same time, strong privacy safeguards applying.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate has had before it for sometime a progress report by the Department of Social Security and the Data-Matching Agency, a report required under guideline 12 of the Schedule to the Act. That report establishes the case for continuation of the program on cost/benefit grounds and I commend the report to Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill also takes this opportunity to make minor modifications to the data-matching program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first modification is an extension of the time allowed for income and payment matching from 24 hours to seven days. This will assist in the generation of more accurate results. On occasion it has appeared that more accurate results could be achieved if preliminary matching results could be tested and the Data-Matching Agency's algorithm changed if necessary to eliminate false positive or false negative results. The Privacy Commissioner has no objection to action such as this extension if it is designed simply to enhance the results.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second minor amendment will alter section 11 of the Principal Act. Section 11 requires that, in most cases, notice of intended adverse action resulting from a data-matching result must be given to an affected person. He or she then has up to 28 days in which to show cause why the proposed action should not be taken. Commonwealth assistance to the person continues during the show cause period. This amendment would allow an assistance agency to cease providing Commonwealth assistance and to take immediate remedial action where the discrepancy is solely attributable to the agency's own administrative error. This is intended to minimise the total amount of money to be recovered from the affected person. The Privacy Commissioner supports this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This data-matching program was introduced with a maximum of consultation. It has operated under the constant and active supervision of the Privacy Commissioner and his officers and I take this opportunity to thank the Commissioner and his staff for their work on this project. I commend its continuance and refinement to the Senate and I present the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill gives effect to several important measures announced in the Budget for improving the benefits available to veterans and their dependants. It also provides for streamlining the administration and delivery of benefits under the income and assets tests.  In addition, the Bill provides for a range of non-Budget measures as well as minor technical and drafting amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the Budget measures, one of the most important is an increase in the rates of disability and service pensions.  This will allow for a one-off increase to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">service pension;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">war widows and war widowers pensions;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the general rate of disability pension;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the special rate of disability pension;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the intermediate rate of disability pension;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the intermediate rate of disability pension; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the "double amputee" rate (items 1-6 of the table at subsection 27(1)), in anticipation of the 1993 March indexation of these amounts.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This increase will be brought forward and paid on 4 February 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An example of what this means to pensioners is that the maximum rate of service pension for a single pensioner will increase by $6 per fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the actual March 1993 indexation would have resulted in a greater increase than the anticipated one, this additional amount will be included before the September 1993 indexation of these pension amounts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This increase is in line with the Government's aim of ensuring that pensions are maintained at the target rate  of 25 per cent of Average Weekly Earnings. It will also ensure that adequate pension rates are maintained and improved over time.  More than half a million veterans and their dependants will benefit from this change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the Government's response to the changing needs of many older veterans and widows, and in keeping with the Government's overall housing and aged care policy, the Defence Service Homes Act is to be amended to allow loans to be used to repair or renovate existing homes or to discharge existing mortgages.  These changes, which come into effect on 1 January 1993, will apply to all those who have an unused entitlement under the Defence Service Homes Act.  They are aimed at making assistance available to allow as many of these people as possible to remain in their own homes by allowing building repairs and modifications to meet their current housing needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment to allow Defence Service Homes loans to be used for the purpose of discharging an existing mortgage will allow first time borrowers access to low interest loans and will have a significant effect on the disposable income of many older veterans and widows on fixed incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To give effect to these changes I have signed a new agreement with Westpac that reflects the changes to the Act.  As part of that agreement the Bank and I have agreed that applicants for Defence Service Homes loans will receive a fifty per cent discount on the loan establishment fees paid by other Westpac housing loan customers.  For the information of the honourable Senators, I table a copy of the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recognition of the trauma of incarceration and the ongoing problems of re-adjustment experienced by former prisoners of war, this Bill will provide for the special grant of war widows pension, to the widows and widowers of certain ex-prisoners of war. This change will come into effect from 1 January 1993 and will also apply to the widows and widowers of any ex-prisoners of war who died before that date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In keeping with the Government's recognition of the needs of ex-prisoners of war, the current special arrangements for prisoners of war detained in Japan will be extended to ex-prisoners of war from the European and Korean theatres. This will include the automatic acceptance of all psychiatric disorders and peptic ulcerative diseases, and the removal of the existing $440 financial limit on dental treatment.  The extension of these special arrangements will proceed by non-legislative means.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another important measure included in this Bill is the extension of fringe benefits to all service pensioners from 1 April 1993.  This will ensure that all service  pensioners will be entitled to the full range of Commonwealth fringe benefits.  This change will not extend the automatic provision of free medical treatment for all conditions at the expense of the Department of Veterans' Affairs to all service pensioners.  It does however, mean that all service pensioners will be eligible for telephone allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments included in this Bill, which were announced in the 1992 Budget include:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">improved assistance for carer service pensioners;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">an increase in remote area allowance;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">reform of the rent assistance provisions;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">simplification of the managed investment rules;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">assessment of capital gains and losses from shares and other listed securities with the provision to offset losses from these investments against shares and managed investments; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">extension of the current assessment rules for compulsorily preserved superannuation benefits to all superannuation benefits held by pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rent assistance reforms target those service pensioners most in need of assistance and support in the private rental market.  As part of these reforms, a service pensioner who does not have a partner with rent increased pension will receive a $4 per fortnight increase in rent assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Likewise, the improved measures for carer service pensioners reflects the Government's commitment to these people who fulfil such an important role in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments to the managed investment rules to operate from 1 April 1993, will provide for common assessment rules for accruing return investments (made after 1 January 1988) and market linked investments (made after 9 September 1988).  Income from these investments will be assessed on an ongoing basis calculated on the rate of return for the investment over the previous twelve months and will allow for losses to be offset against income from other managed investments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This proposal does not affect accruing return and market linked investments made before these dates.  Such investments continue to be protected from the assessment of ongoing income and will only be assessed on realisation of the investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remainder of the Bill deals with a number of important non-Budget legislative proposals and minor technical and drafting amendments.  The more important of  these non-Budget measures are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">an amendment to the income test provisions to ensure that financial assistance to people with medically acquired HIV infection and AIDS is exempted from the operation of the income test;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the inclusion of pharmaceutical allowance in the assessment of service pension.  The amendment will ensure that where a service pension is reduced below the maximum rate, pharmaceutical allowance will be the last component in the reduction process.  It means that at no time will the service pensioner receive less than his or her full rate of pharmaceutical allowance; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">clarification of the jurisdiction of the Veterans' Review Board in relation to decisions which are reviewed by the Repatriation Commission under section 31 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act.  This amendment will remove doubts about the VRB's jurisdiction and ensure that no applicants will be disadvantaged by a particular interpretation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The financial implications of the non-Budget measures contained in this Bill are negligible.  The cost of the Budget measures amounts to $24.024 million in 1992/93, $10.842 million in 1993/94 and $12.015 million in 1994/95 after allowing for savings offsets of $19.160 million in 1993/94 and $22.060 million in 1994/95 arising from the changes to the assessment of shares.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill introduces amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 which will detail more precisely, for the guidance of decision-makers, the steps involved in, and the manner of determining, whether or not an injury, disease or death is war-caused or defence-caused under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The amendments will set out how the standard of proof and `reasonable hypothesis' provisions are to operate in making such a determination when a claim for pension relates to operational, peacekeeping or hazardous service. They will not change in any way the existing eligibility criteria for either disability or service pension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the amendments will be to reverse the effect of the decision of the High Court of Australia in Bushell v. Repatriation Commission, handed down by the Court on 7 October 1992. The amendments will return to the position that was intended to apply to the determination of claims following the introduction of the Veterans' Entitlements Act in 1986 and which the Repatriation Commission had understood had been endorsed by a number of leading decisions of the Federal Court, including the Full Bench of the Federal Court in East v. Repatriation Commission and the majority of the Full Bench of the Federal Court in Repatriation Commission v. Bushell itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The standard of proof provisions in both the Veterans' Entitlements Act and its forerunner, the Repatriation Act 1920, have been the subject of considerable litigation and legislative change since the `beyond reasonable doubt' standard of proof was inserted into the Repatriation Act in 1977. Those changes were introduced by the then Government notwithstanding express comments in the 1975 Toose Report against the applicability of the criminal standard to pension proceedings. The High Court, in Law's case in 1981, held that those words amounted to the criminal standard of proof.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must stress, of course, that the criminal standard of proof does not mean proof beyond all shadow of a doubt, but the O'Brien High Court decision in 1985 virtually amounted to this&mdash;hence the 1985 changes to the legislation to overcome that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Second Reading Speech made on that occasion set out in detail the reasons for those changes and much of the recent history of the legislation. The 1985 changes introduced the requirement that a `reasonable hypothesis' of the relevant war service connection must exist before a claim could be granted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The comments made in that 1985 speech are relevant to this Bill. I also refer senators to the detailed Explanatory Memorandum which accompanies this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1986, the Repatriation Act 1920 was repealed and replaced by the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. A substantial measure of consensus as to the form of the standard of proof provision, section 120, was reached with the ex-service community. It made significant changes to the 1985 amendments and was intended to have the following effect:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">first, a reasonable hypothesis, and the facts founding it, were to be determined only after all the material had been considered and evaluated. That is, an `end of the day' test was involved;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">secondly, a single stage process was envisaged. Satisfaction of the reasonable hypothesis was intended to be taken as satisfaction of the `beyond reasonable doubt' standard. If a reasonable hypothesis was established, the relevant war service connection was held to exist and the claim allowed. If not, the claim would be rejected. The 1985 dispelling provisions were removed; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">thirdly, no onus of proof was cast either on the claimant or the Repatriation Commission, and no presumption of entitlement was conferred on a claimant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions were intended to ensure that the well reasoned AAT decision in the O'Brien case, which was upheld by Brennan J in his minority judgment in that case, would be valid if made under the new legislation. The Bushell case involved similar medical issues as O'Brien and was rejected at all three levels of the determining system, that is, by the Repatriation Commission, the Veterans' Review Board and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as well as by the Full Bench of the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, the 1986 legislation was followed by a comprehensive AAT decision in the case of East, upheld by the Full Bench of the Federal Court, which is considered to have confirmed, generally, the intention behind the changes to the legislation. The High Court refused special leave to appeal from the Federal Court's decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is now clear, however, from the Bushell decision that the 1986 provisions are not sufficiently comprehensive to achieve their intention. The result of the decision is  that satisfaction of the `reasonable hypothesis' test does not exhaust the `beyond reasonable doubt' test. It was held to be a threshold test rather than, as intended, a test which is conclusive of the question whether the relevant war service connection exists. That is, a reasonable hypothesis can now be raised on only some of the material, without an evaluation or analysis of all the material.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The same applies to the facts that are required to support the hypothesis. They can be inferred on only some of the evidence and must be disproved beyond reasonable doubt if their existence, and that of the reasonable hypothesis, is to be rejected. The O'Brien decision established that this will be impossible in most cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additionally, the High Court held in Bushell that a reasonable hypothesis could be raised where it was supported merely by a responsible medical practitioner speaking within the ambit of that practitioner's expertise, even though it might be an opinion against the weight of informed medical opinion, or have little support in the medical profession or among scientists, or have been discarded by medical opinion for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of such an interpretation would be that the only cases which will not succeed are those where there is no evidence, or the only evidence is to the contrary of the relevant service, injury or disease, or where no medical practitioner or other expert is willing to suggest an hypothesis linking the injury, disease or death with service. Such cases are rare.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, in a recent case the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, after quoting at length from Bushell, relied on the opinion of a para-medical person, who was not a qualified doctor, in preference to the opinions of three medical specialists. The AAT found that a heart condition and anxiety disorder were war-caused when the veteran had a total of less than four days of operational service, over a three month period, in which he was not involved in any combat.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this amounts to a return of the O'Brien situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As highlighted in the 1985 Second Reading Speech, the comprehensive three tiered determining system was hardly a sign that there was to be virtual automatic acceptance of disability and war widows' claims. The anticipated impact of the decision is that there will be a large increase in the Department's expenditure on disability pensions, war widows pensions and associated treatment costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, there is an issue of more fundamental concern. As the Acting Minister said in that speech, `it has always been accepted that the Repatriation pension system should be generous. Nevertheless generosity seems to have gone beyond reasonable bounds. . . '. The Australian repatriation system is already the most beneficial in the world. The recent decision goes far beyond what was intended in 1986 and provides benefits in circumstances where no reasonable person would believe them to be appropriate. The provision of benefits in such circumstances raises real questions of social justice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I remind honourable senators of a statement made in 1988 by the Veterans' Entitlements Act Monitoring Committee, which was established to review the first 12 months operation of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. In commenting on a Federal Court decision which has now been revived by the Bushell case, the Committee stated that no legislative action should be taken to overrule that decision unless, in subsequent decisions to the same effect, it was found that the 1985 amendments were being frustrated and, in particular, that the effect of the High Court decision in O'Brien had not been negated. It is significant to note that the Committee was chaired by the Honourable Paul Toose, CBE, QC and included representatives from the Returned Services League of Australia, the Australian Veterans' and Defence Services Council, and a former chairman of the Legacy Co-ordinating Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the situation contemplated by the Monitoring Committee has now arisen. Legislative action is necessary. The existing `beyond reasonable doubt' terminology of section 120 will be retained in its present form, but its effect will be clarified by amendments to accord with the intended effect I have referred to earlier. In addition a new section, 119A, will be inserted setting out both the order and manner in which the relevant facts and causation issue will be decided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main effects of the proposed amendments will be threefold:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">first, they will ensure that all relevant facts must be found before proceeding to determine the causation issue under subsection 120(1), that is, whether the injury, disease or death is war-caused. If any essential facts are found not to exist the causation issue will not arise and the claim cannot proceed. The findings in respect of both the facts and the causation issue are to take place in a structured manner and on the basis of a full examination, assessment and evaluation of all the evidence. It will not be a question of raising the existence of a necessary fact or hypothesis on the basis of only some of the evidence, with the Commission having to dispel the fact or hypothesis beyond reasonable doubt;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">secondly, they will ensure that the establishment of a reasonable hypothesis connecting the incapacity or death with war service, is a single `end of the day' process which exhausts the requirements of the `beyond reasonable doubt' test, and is  not itself required to be dispelled beyond reasonable doubt;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will be achieved by significant changes to the words of existing subsection 120(3) and by the insertion of a Note to subsection 120(1). The changes to subsection (3) will eliminate any interpretation of the existing words that the `raising' of a reasonable hypothesis `after consideration of the whole of the material' merely means the `raising' of an hypothesis on some of the evidence after completion of the gathering of all the evidence. The changes will confirm that the hypothesis has to be `established' not merely `raised', and that this is to be `on the basis of all the material' after a comprehensive evaluation of that material in accordance with the amendments.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">thirdly, they will define the circumstances in which an hypothesis of a connection with war service will not be regarded as reasonable. These will include, for example, circumstances where the hypothesis is fanciful, speculative, unreal, tenuous or remote, or is not grounded in the particular circumstances of the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the amendments will overturn the effect of the Bushell decision that a medical opinion may raise a reasonable hypothesis even though it is not generally accepted as being reasonable by expert medical or scientific opinion. An hypothesis will not be reasonable in these circumstances, nor if it is out-weighed by a more persuasive and compelling expert opinion, or by a greater substantial body of expert opinion. A decision-maker, therefore, will be required to conduct a thorough evaluation, and to form a view upon, the medical and scientific opinion, rather than merely identify whether a purported reasonable hypothesis is supported by a responsible medical practitioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I also draw your attention to the fact that a report by the Auditor-General on compensation for veterans and war widows should be finalised and tabled in the next few weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The audit report is expected to raise fundamental issues which will require long and careful examination, hopefully on a bipartisan basis. Changes to the legislation to reverse the Bushell decision cannot, however, await that examination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, while there would be no additional or reduced expenditure flowing from this Bill, if the effect of the High Court's decision were not legislatively overturned by the measures contained in it, the estimated additional program costs would be $10-15m in 1992-93, $60-105m in 1993-94, $80-135m in 1994-95 and $100-180m in 1995-96. The increased costs by the financial year 2001-02 would be $235m to $440m. By that time the accumulated cost for the  first 10 years, would be $1.2 billion to $2.2 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The financial implications of not proceeding with legislative action are, therefore, very significant. So too, as I have said, are the equitable considerations. I assure honourable senators that these amendments will not affect, but are designed to protect, the legitimate claims and rights of the veteran community which will continue to be guaranteed by the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act will continue to provide that, in determining any claim, a determining authority is required to act according to substantial justice and the merits and all the circumstances of the case. The Act will continue to take account of difficulties that lie in the way of ascertaining facts, including for any reason attributable to the effects of the passage of time, the availability of witnesses, or any deficiency in official records. Furthermore, once any hypothesis is found to be reasonable, the claim must succeed even if medical opinion is that the hypothesised connection is not the most likely cause.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must also stress that the Government is being even handed in its treatment of Court decisions which it believes at the time to be inconsistent with equity and the intention of the legislation. I remind honourable senators that when the Federal Court held that T&amp;PI pensioners could, contrary to established practice, have their pensions automatically revoked at age 65 the Government acted very quickly to legislate to preserve the previous position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, let me reiterate the Government's commitment generally to the continuation of generous and effective benefits and treatment for those who suffer because of their war service for Australia. Australia has by far the most comprehensive and generous repatriation benefits in the world. After the Bill I have introduced becomes law, this will still be the position, and this Bill's effect of preventing an escalation in costs, will help to ensure that expenditure is directed to the legitimate needs and priorities of our veterans and war widows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL TRAINING AUTHORITY BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I take great pleasure in introducing to the House a package of legislation comprising the Australian National Training Authority Bill 1992 and the Vocational Education and Training Funding Bill 1992. Together, these bills provide for triennial funding for vocational education and training and the establishment of the Australian National Training Authority (the Authority).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These two measures give effect to the agreement between the Commonwealth and the States to establish the new National Vocational Education and Training System, of which the new Authority will be the centre piece. The terms of this agreement are set out in the Statement released by the Prime Minister on 21 July this year, and included as a schedule to the Australian National Training Authority Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Statement provides for the National System to take full effect from 1 January 1994. Considerable preparation will be required to ensure that the new planning and funding arrangements are properly in place by that date. For this reason, the Commonwealth agreed to introduce legislation to establish the national authority during the current sittings. This will allow the Authority to become operational early in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National System, and the creation of the National Authority, mark a significant stage in Australia's development as a clever and a capable country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the first time, the vocational education and training sector will have a secure funding base on which to plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">State Governments have agreed to at least maintain their current effort for vocational education and training on an ongoing basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With this package of legislation, the Government honours its own commitment in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> to provide secure and substantial funding for vocational education and training on a triennial basis. The Commonwealth will maintain the level of financial support for vocational education and training currently paid through States Grants arrangements, incorporating within the base the extra $100 million provided through the November 1991 Economic Statement. In addition, the Commonwealth will provide real growth $70 million a year in 1993, 1994 and 1995, bringing the Commonwealth's additional expenditure on vocational education and training during the triennium to $720 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the first time also, there will be a consistent national approach to planning for vocational education and training, with common and agreed national goals, a national strategic plan and national planning parameters forming the basis for individual State training profiles, jointly developed between the Authority and State training agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And for the first time, there will be an independent statutory authority to oversee and participate in the planning and funding arrangements for vocational education and training. The Authority will comprise a Board of 5 independent members, chosen for their acknowledged expertise and providing for a strong industry representation in the development of the National System.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was pleased to announce on 22 September that the new Authority will be chaired by Mr Brian Finn AO, Managing Director of IBM (Australia), who is expected to take up his position towards the middle of 1993. Mr Finn chaired the Australian Education Council's Review Committee on Young People's Participation in Post-compulsory Education and Training, whose July 1991 report was a primary stimulus for the creation of the new National System.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other members of the Board of the Authority will be:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ms Anne Rein, Head of Tourism Training Australia, who will be the Board's Deputy Chairperson;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Michael Deeley, recently retired Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of ICI Australia;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Stuart Hornery AO, the Chairman of Lend Lease Corporation Limited; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Bill Mansfield, Assistant Secretary with the ACTU.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Authority will be overseen by a Ministerial Council, chaired by the Commonwealth Minister and representing all the States and Territories. The Ministerial Council will be responsible for decisions on strategic policy, national objectives and priorities. It will provide advice to the Commonwealth on the level of growth funds required to meet agreed participation targets and, in the context of the National Strategic Plan, will determine the principles to be applied to the allocation of these funds between the States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also the Ministerial Council's function to approve the training profiles developed jointly by the Authority and the State training agencies. These agencies will be responsible for the management of vocational education and training within the State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Authority will play a pivotal role in shaping the new National System. Subject to any directions from the Ministerial Council, the Authority will provide advice and other input to the Council on the range of matters that fall within its functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority will also receive vocational education and training funds from the Commonwealth and from the States, and, on the basis of the national allocation principles determined by the Ministerial Council, will allocate and pay those funds to the States, or to other parties where appropriate. It will play a key role in the overall planning of vocational education and training, from a national perspective, and administer any national programs assigned to it by the Ministerial Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A central aim of the new National System will be to promote closer, more effective interaction between industry and vocational education and training providers. I have referred to the industry representation on the Board of the Authority. In addition, this Bill provides for consultation between the Authority and industry, including the Industry Training Advisory Body network and representatives of industries, employers and trade unions. There is also provision in the Statement for industry involvement at the State level in key aspects of the National System, including in the development of State training profiles and the provision of input to the national strategic plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority's functions are set out in the Australian National Training Authority Bill 1992, to which I now turn.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill establishes the Australian National Training Authority and sets out the framework for its operations within the National System. The Authority will have the functions ascribed to it in the agreed 21 July Statement, which are set out in the Bill and in particular in clause 6 of Part 2.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 6 also foreshadows the conferring of functions on the Authority by State Governments, which have signalled their intention to introduce during 1993 complementary legislation related to the National System.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In performing its functions, the Authority will be subject to the terms of the Statement and to directions of the Ministerial Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the arrangements set out in Part 3 of the Bill for the allocation and payment of funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth and the States have agreed to pass their vocational education and training funds to the Authority. Consistent with the provisions of the Statement, the Commonwealth has also agreed to pass to the Authority certain national programs currently administered by the Department of Employment, Education and Training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The money paid to the Authority will form a pool for allocation by the Authority in accordance with national allocation principles determined by the Ministerial Council. In recognition of the importance of maintaining the capital facilities and infrastructure for this sector, the Bill specifically provides that the Ministerial Council may determine that part of the money paid by the Commonwealth to the Authority is for allocation for expenditure of a capital nature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once allocated by the Authority, the funds will be paid according to the arrangements agreed by Heads of Government. Each State will receive an amount not less than the sum of the amount paid to the Authority by the State and the amount of Commonwealth vocational education and training funds paid to the State by the Authority in the preceding year (excluding amounts paid specifically for expenditure on national projects or on capital). These arrangements guarantee planning certainty for the States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A State will qualify for additional Commonwealth growth funds only once its training profile has been agreed by the Ministerial Council. This helps ensure that additional Commonwealth funds are spent in accordance with the agreed national objectives and the national strategic plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides that the Authority may also allocate and pay funds to other parties for expenditure on national programs or national projects. Consistent with the terms of the Statement, a clear aim of the National System will be the promotion of a more effective training market, comprising public and private provision of advanced technical training and further education opportunities. Money paid by the Authority to a State may also be used for the provision of places through either public or private providers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 4 of the Bill contains provisions for public accountability on the funding and performance of the National Vocational Education and Training System.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each State will be required to provide the Authority with an audited financial statement on the expenditure of funds paid by the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority will submit to the Ministerial Council a draft annual national report on the performance of the vocational education and training system. Once approved, the annual national report would be tabled in both Houses of the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 5 of the Bill provides for the Authority's finances. The Commonwealth has agreed to meet the Authority's establishment and running costs. The initial operating budget will be determined when the Authority's size and structure have been established, probably early in 1993. The Authority's running costs needs will be considered within the Government's annual Budget context, on the basis of estimates prepared by the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the administrative provisions relating to the Authority, which will consist of 5 members, including a Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson. Members will be appointed by the Governor-General, on the nomination of the Ministerial Council, for a period of up to 3 years, and could be re-appointed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members could be appointed on a full-time or a part-time basis. The Ministerial Council has agreed that, for the foreseeable future, members will be appointed part-time but that the flexibility to allow for a full-time appointment should be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Division 1 of Part 6 also sets out standard provisions for remuneration, allowances and other benefits for Board members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority will meet as required to perform its functions. Three members will be required to form a quorum at a meeting, and at least 3 votes would be required to decide any matter at a meeting of the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the provisions of Part 7 of the Bill, which relate to the Chief Executive Officer and staff of the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chief Executive Officer will be appointed by the Authority after consultation with the Ministerial Council. Once again, there are standard provisions for remuneration, allowances and other benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions of Division 2 of Part 7, which relate to the staff of the Authority, reflect the nature of the Authority as a Commonwealth statutory authority, accountable to a Council of Commonwealth and State Ministers and assuming responsibility for some programs currently administered by a Commonwealth Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two main options for the Authority's staff. The Authority may employ its own staff under written agreements, with terms and conditions consistent with any guidelines determined by the Ministerial Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the second main option, staff of the Authority may be persons appointed or employed under the Public Service Act 1922. In particular, staff already employed under the Public Service Act who are successful in selection for a position with the Authority may elect to join the Authority under the provisions of the Public Service Act and Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority may also second staff or engage consultants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the final, miscellaneous provisions of the Australian National Training Authority Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 8 contains standard provisions relating to delegation and the making of regulations. It also provides a means for changing the name of the Authority on the basis of a Ministerial Council decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I referred at the outset to the agreement between the Commonwealth and all the States to establish the Australian National Training Authority as part of a new, National Vocational Education and Training System. That agreement was reached after a sustained period of negotiations, during which the needs for a national and properly funded system of vocational education and training were balanced against the constitutional reality that vocational education and training remains primarily a responsibility of the States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This package of legislation respects that balance. It honours the Commonwealth's commitment to provide triennial funding for vocational education and training, including a total of $720 million in additional funds over the 1993-95 triennium. It establishes the Australian National Training Authority as an independent Commonwealth statutory authority that is responsible to the Commonwealth-State Ministerial Council. And it provides the framework of national planning and national reporting, a framework within which our vocational education and training system can respond most effectively and efficiently to the needs of industry and of individual Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to honourable Senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill provides Commonwealth funds for vocational education and training for the 1993-95 triennium.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 2 of the Bill amends the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Act 1989 to provide supplementation in respect of 1992 recurrent funds. The States Grants is further amended to provide for Commonwealth funds for vocational education and training to be paid through States Grants arrangements in 1993, 1994 and 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for the appropriation of a total of $552.187 million in 1993; $630.795 million in 1994; $709.825 million in 1995; and for an additional $5.028 million for recurrent purposes in 1992, in line with normal cost supplementation arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 3 of the Bill provides for the payment of vocational education and training funds to the proposed Australian National Training Authority in respect of 1994 and 1995.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a moment I will move that this matter be adjourned until later in order that the details can be considered by the Opposition. However, I put on the record now that obviously we are particularly disturbed by the state of the program and the enormous volume of legislation that has been introduced at the last moment. The fact is that it will be impossible, even with the extra week that the Government is asking us to sit, to give proper scrutiny to the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of that is that this chamber is not carrying out one of its primary functions in the way that we would desire. There is no reason why it should be so. With proper and reasonable planning, the essential Bills for the Government's program would have been introduced earlier in the session when the pressure was not on the chamber and given proper scrutiny. Year after year, session after session, we have said to this Government `Can you make an effort to manage your program more effectively?'. Each time they tell us, `Yes, we will', and subsequently on each occasion we find the program is in a worst state than it was on a previous occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the point of view of organising the program, in my view that is unforgivable.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The end result is that we have this enormous build-up. The job cannot be done properly and the Government now requires the Senate to sit another week, which means that we will be sitting four weeks in a row and extended hours during those weeks. In fact, we will be sitting for six weeks out of the last seven. I do not think that people quite appreciate that basically that means 18-hour days every day.

It is poor government, and Ministers should recognise that they have failed in their responsibility.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a couple of brief comments on the modelling unit about which I have a reservation in the report of Estimates Committee B. The remarks I would like to make relate to the debate which we have now had over two sets of Estimates committee hearings&mdash;additional Estimates in April and the one which has just concluded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My reservation relates to the use by the Government of the Public Service. It is not my intention at this moment to recap the debate we had in the recent Estimates Committee, but merely to put on record something which I believe is of great concern in this country and which I hope the Public Service, in the coming months and perhaps in the next year or so, will look very closely at. That question relates to what I would term the politicisation of the Public Service, what the appropriate role of public servants is and how that role can be kept in line with the best traditions of the Public Service and be protected from what I see as the growing politicisation of the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen in Victoria and Western Australia that an independent public service, a public service which has a public service ethic, is of fundamental importance to the good governance of this country. Whereas I would not at this stage suggest that the Federal Treasury has reached a stage where we can see wholesale politicisation of this great Service, I believe that the experience of the modelling unit which was established under Dr Preston raises very grave concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last October, the head of the Treasury, Mr Cole, issued a press release saying that he wished to assure people that the Public Service was very conscious of the need to maintain its proper role and to avoid public servants being involved in political activity. That, to my mind, was a sensible and important statement. But the issue I believe people will have to address is whether Mr Tony Cole, Dr Preston and Dr Henry really complied with the spirit of that press release and with the traditions of the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important aspect of maintaining confidence in Australia is confidence in the Treasury&mdash;confidence in its capacity to produce objective figures and its capacity to give fearless advice. My concern is that I believe that, in establishing the modelling unit under Dr Preston and run by Dr Henry, the Treasury tipped over into involving itself in a party political activity and not a traditional Public Service activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan and I will differ on whether the behaviour of that unit was proper and in line with the best traditions of the Public Service or whether some serious errors of judgment were made, both by the Government and particularly by the guardians of the Public Service ethic, in this case Mr Cole and Dr Preston. I happen to think that a very serious error of judgment has been made and I hope that the Public Service, in its seminars and in debates that may occur over the coming period about issues concerning politicisation of the Public Service, will look very closely at whether Mr Cole and Dr Preston suddenly involved themselves in activities which were not in line with the best traditions of the Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that if a unit in the Public Service acts like a political unit, is staffed like a political unit and does the work of a political unit, then it is a political unit and is not a public service unit. I have laid down in a number of speeches now some of the serious errors of judgment which I believe were made. I do not intend to add to those at present, but I believe that this is a very significant development in the history of the Australian Public Service. If the modelling unit, especially established under Dr Preston and now disbanded after its work has been done, represents the new standard of conduct of the Public Service, I believe that something serious has happened in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I believe that there was a need for the Government to hide behind the great authority, tradition and prestige of the Treasury in order to mount an attack on the Opposition of an absolutely unprecedented level in terms of involvement of the Australian Public Service. I certainly accept, and it is a matter of record, that in the past the Public Service has provided briefing notes to governments on Opposition policies. Never has a special unit been established to attack an Opposition policy. And not only have briefing notes been provided but also this modelling unit has had assumptions ceaselessly fed into it by the Government to try to create results which will add weight to the Government's case. Public servants of very high standing and very high salaries were involved in this work and I believe that if this becomes the standard of conduct of the Public Service, Australia has lost a great deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Mr Cole and Dr Preston should look very closely at their conduct. It gives me no great pleasure to involve public servants in public debate, but if public servants decide they wish to, at the bidding of political masters, get out of the trenches and start firing shots at the political opponents of the Government, it is absolutely inevitable that those people will get caught up in the cross-fire. They cannot get out of their trenches, fire shots at the political opponents of the Government and then say, `Don't fire at me; I am a public servant'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have, I believe, is a very serious occasion where not only have the public servants made serious misjudgments as to their role, but also the Government has made serious misjudgments involving the public servants in this role. I suggest to public servants and the Treasury, and perhaps younger Treasury officers who may at some stage read these remarks, that they look at how often the Government, in mounting its attacks against the coalition, has said, `The Treasury says this', `The Treasury says that', `The Treasury has estimated such and such' when the reality is that the tables and figures which have been produced have resulted from government assumptions being fed into a Treasury model. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether Mr Cole and Dr Preston at any stage expressed concern to the Government along the lines of: `Whereas we have produced these figures we are worried that you are directly involving us in political debate'. I have noticed that Mr Dawkins, Mr Keating and Senator Button in this chamber&mdash;I do not know about Senator McMullan; I will have to look at the record&mdash;have stood up and said, `The Treasury has said that under Fightback such and such will happen' or `The Treasury has said that under your wages policy such and such will happen' when a close examination of the record shows that the Treasury has said no such thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only for the public servants to closely examine their conduct in this whole rather sordid matter; it is also for the Government to examine its conduct. Let me tell the chamber that if this is the new rule for the Public Service, an incoming government will inevitably trade off the precedents which have become accepted and established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not my intention this evening to enter into a debate, but I hope that in the coming months and years, when we talk about politicisation of the Public Service, we will take up the issue which has been presented to us&mdash;the modelling unit established by Mr Cole and Dr Preston, and relentlessly used by Mr Dawkins and Mr Keating. I hope we will ask ourselves, `Is this the appropriate behaviour for the Public Service in this country?'. I believe that when it is judged in this light, Mr Dawkins, Mr Keating, Mr Cole and Dr Preston will be judged somewhat harshly by those who come after us. </PARA>

I am often in here debating Senator Macdonald, who often&mdash;as do others, I am sure&mdash;chooses parts of the Treasury analysis.

It is a part of the debate that goes on. It is a comment on the respect and integrity of the Treasury and the figures that it produces that all sides of the debate fall upon the figures it produces which can be claimed, at least in part, to support their case. That is all I want to say about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to respond to one particular phrase which Senator Kemp used which I found most unfortunate and most unfair. He was criticising the role of the unit. I disagree with him, but he was expressing his view and, in a democracy, we are all entitled to do that. He then said, `This is staffed like a political unit'. That is very unfair to everybody involved. It is very unfair to all the officers who made the decision, who implemented the decision and who were discharging their lawful instructions from their Minister properly and in accordance with the normal processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was an unfortunate phrase and I want to say quickly that I think it was unreasonable. Tony Cole, Alan Preston, Ken Henry and any of the other officers involved will, should the unfortunate circumstance ever arise that the now Opposition becomes the government, serve that government very well as public servants, as they have served this Government well, because they are competent professionals. I think it was unfortunate that it was expressed in that manner. Beyond that, this is a debate that we have had before. We have both put our positions on the record before, we have said it again tonight, and I am sure we will do it again on a few more occasions, but I hope we can now get on to other parts of the Estimates. </PARA>

<PARA>I have pointed out to Senator McMullan that this was not an answer to the question asked.

<PARA>Senator McMullan will know that I am particularly interested in this because Mr Keating got special treatment and last year 10,800 ordinary Australians were prosecuted. So I asked this year for the figures. I asked:</PARA>

<PARA>I would have thought that was a straightforward question. The answer reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.    The number of taxpayers convicted for failure to comply with the requirement of the Commissioner in 1992 was 6,821 and the number of charges that went through to conviction was 8,069.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trip report is mostly recorded of confidential discussions between Australian officials and New Zealand officials and of discussions in confidence with New Zealand business representatives and academics. The report covered a trip to New Zealand between 16 September and 18 September 1991 to study the modelling of that country's goods and services tax and various compliance costs, administration costs and other issues. For example, discussions covered implications for setting monetary and fiscal policies of the price effects of GST implementation. To release reports of such discussions would violate the confidences surrounding them and reduce the value to the Australian Government of future consultations. Officials of foreign governments would be reluctant to speak frankly and fully to Australian officials if they knew that despite misunderstandings of confidentiality the contents of those discussions could subsequently be published in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, many questions were asked of both Tax and Treasury relating to work done by Tax and Treasury to the implementation of a goods and services tax. That is why that question is relevant. I would say that, in the climate when it was well and truly known that the Opposition was committed to a goods and services tax, to talk about this having to remain cosy and confidential so the Government could do a bit of work on it is not a satisfactory answer.

I refer to questions asked of Mr Highfield concerning the questioning we had about the shortfall in money to pay salaries. Honourable senators will recall that I said that the Tax Office, if it were a corporation, would have been placed in receivership because, quite frankly, it would run out of money in 1992-93 because it had approximately 1,000 people who were surplus to the collection of the revenue and who had to stay on the payroll because of the Public Sector Union agreement entered into as a competing agreement by the Taxation Office.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More people are staying in the Tax Office than ever before. In the past, something like 8 to 10 per cent of our staff in any one year would have moved onto other careers or retired.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year fewer people left.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have reduced recruiting to a minimum, as you know. And we have begun programs to make it easier to transfer to other Departments, and to take positive action to reduce our extra staff load. But the effect of fewer people leaving, especially during the past couple of years is still with us. Our budget shortfall is around $20 million out of a total salary and administrative budget of some $825 million. If we did nothing, we would for 1992/93 effectively have 600 people over our salary budget. 350 of these are not actual people, but the extra salary to cover increments&mdash;and I have asked the Department of Finance to increase our running cost funds to cover this unexpected increase.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We had several instances where the Tax Office had to change the record. It fixed it all right. It converted $61m of money for administration into salary money and borrowed another $19m. Mr Mobbs, who is with us tonight, gave us a delightful presentation. He gave us a presentation which was called `Is the ATO bankrupt: the borrowing picture'. That is an interesting document. He said that back in 1989-90 the Tax Office had a borrowing that was repaid; in 1990-91 it did not have to borrow anything and in 1991-92 it borrowed $3m, which was repaid. Then he showed us the line which said that in 1992-93 $19m was borrowed and $18m repaid. The trouble was that it was not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We found out after rather lengthy questioning that Mr Mobbs had told us something that was not true. In fact, what had occurred was that he, the Tax Office, Mr Boucher or somebody had got the Government to promise that next year it would forgive $18m of the $19m borrowed. That was correction No. 1 that we had to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went on to look at the further allocations. In the current year, 1992-93, there was a change in the rules from Finance and you could forward borrow up to 6 per cent, instead of 3 per cent. Mr Mobbs showed us that in 1993-94, 1994-95 and 1995-96 he could go on borrowing up to $41m, $40m and another $40m. When I asked him on a subsequent occasion whether this was why it thought it could scrape through, he said, `Yes, that would be right'. The only trouble was that Mr Mobbs had not read the Finance regulations properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very simply, one may not borrow in two consecutive years without having a special arrangement with the Department of Finance. The Department of Finance gave evidence that there was no such agreement in place. The evidence that Mr Mobbs gave us that he could continue to borrow for the subsequent years was also not true. He had to admit that he was embarrassed and he apologised for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I felt sorry for Mr Mobbs because he had been placed in an untenable position. He was the man who was supposed to prove that the Tax Office did not need the $114m, which quite clearly it did. When we go to back to Mr Boucher's opening statement in evidence in October&mdash;bearing in mind his speech in March&mdash;we find that in a very high-minded way he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These views that Senator Bishop is putting are significantly damaging to the Tax Office . . . They are so potentially damaging that I would like the Committee, as I say, to hear and consider what we have to say.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, what Mr Mobbs had to say. Mr Boucher continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then, in due course, my request is that the Committee should as a committee formally disassociate itself from what I believe are extravagant claims in those respects&mdash;that is, I am asking that the Committee pass judgment on this issue, being confident of the outcome.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he was trying to say that the ATO did not need the $114m and that it could get by without it. Very simply, it could not. We will go back to Estimates Committee hearings in a moment and we will see how the $1.7 billion was found at the same time as the Tax Office got the extra $114m. If we look at the figures, we see that there is to be a payment of $42.3m to be given to the Tax Office in the next calendar year, but no revenue is to be collected until the year after the first payment is made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the fascinating system whereby the forecasts for collection of the revenue were down by $3.4 billion&mdash;in other words, it got it wrong. Mr Boucher admitted in March that salaries could not be paid. By the time the Tax Office came to give testimony in October to the Estimates committees, it made no mention of the fact that it had such a shortfall. It purported to give evidence that showed that it had forward borrowings available to it, which it did not. The Tax Office purported to say that it had repaid money, which it had not. Quite frankly, when Mr Highfield said there was no shortfall, that is what was meant, and yet only a month before Mr Boucher had said it was there. Now, testing the information given to Senator McMullan, I want the Tax Office to outline chapter and verse precisely where the savings&mdash;every little bit that Mr Boucher refers to&mdash;were found. I repeat: chapter and verse. </PARA>

That strategy was sent to Mr Dawkins on 16 September. In other words, all the work was allegedly completed within less than three weeks; that is just not possible.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Boucher said in a speech he made to the Tax Office at the end of March 1992 that there was a shortfall in revenue of approximately $20m. Mr Highfield told us in October 1992 that there was no shortfall. At no stage did anybody at all give evidence, despite close questioning in both the Public Accounts Committee hearings and the Estimates hearings, that at any stage the Tax Office had admitted there was a shortfall and that it had to take certain precautions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply cannot see, on the evidence that has been presented over days, that there is anything to suggest that any savings were made that could fill that hole. In fact, the $19m forward borrowing could well have filled that hole for that current year. But that would stop the Tax Office borrowing forward and it would need, as I said, part of that $114m the following year, and it would need that $114m over the three-year period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked the officers to take this matter on notice, to go away and bring back chapter and verse in every detail where they allege that $20m was saved, bearing in mind that Mr Highfield told the Estimates Committee&mdash;when he was asked about the strategy on which he and Mr Carmody had worked for less than three weeks to produce the one that was subsequently adopted by Mr Dawkins&mdash;that, indeed, that document read at its face value would suggest to the reader that it was meant to pay for 630 new employees. He admitted in those hearings that in fact there was nothing in that document that really necessitated those employees to be new employees, and that it was money that would be used to pay existing employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, we have seen an admission by Mr Boucher of the shortfall and what I can only describe as a cover-up after that to try to say that the Tax Office was in good shape. The $1.7 billion which is alleged to have been found, quite frankly, if it was able to be identified, should have been being recovered then and there&mdash;not waiting until the year 1993-94, which is what is proposed. To say that the Tax Office is mismanaged is, I think,  a very fair comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the record we have a thousand people redundant or surplus to the needs of the Tax Office; 3,000 people promised to be no longer employed by the Tax Office under the agreement with the Department of Finance; a Public Sector Union agreement which precludes anybody being compulsorily retrenched&mdash;and, therefore, the Tax Office finding itself in the situation described by Mr Boucher in March and denied any knowledge of in October. It will be interesting to look at whether some of the evidence which was given amounts to perjury in the terms of the Public Accounts Committee Act. Then we have the blow-out in the figures where there was a shortfall in projected revenues of $3.4 billion. The record is one of mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we add to that the Auditor-General's report that the Australian Tax Office keeps inadequate records and we read the report that came down on electronic lodgment where no work has been done to remedy the faulty legal structure that is in place, despite the fact that it has been in operation since 1990, I think there is a very good case that the Tax Office is going to have to lift its game. If Mr Boucher's leaving is going to facilitate that, then perhaps even the price of a ticket to Paris is going to be justified. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I do not want to delay the Committee very long. Like Senator Bishop, I am a member of the Public Accounts Committee and, like Senator Bishop&mdash;or perhaps unlike Senator Bishop&mdash;I have read all the evidence. In fact, I have read all the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> transcripts and I cannot, as yet, come to the conclusion that, to quote Senator Bishop, `the Tax Office is mismanaged'. She describes that as a fair comment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We sat on that Committee together week after week with Senator Watson and others. We looked at the evidence, we heard various groups coming before us and there was a great deal of questioning of Mr Boucher and his officers. I think that the processes involved in an inquiry like that conducted by the Public Accounts Committee are that we hear the evidence; we then make a judgment on that evidence; then, as a committee, we make a judgment; and our report is then presented to the Parliament. That is especially an appropriate process if, for example, anything in the report reflects in any way at all on individual officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the point I want to make tonight is, first of all, that there are many people, I would say the vast majority of people on the Public Accounts Committee, all the members, who have not yet made a judgment about the Australian Tax Office. We will not make that judgment until we have read all the transcripts and presumably until we have spoken as a committee. Today we made a decision at our meeting, at which Senator Bishop was not present, that we would in fact hold some judgments over&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I have in no way discussed what was decided at that meeting. What I am saying is that the processes of that Committee are, in fact, still going on, as they should be. It is a very complex matter. It is the first major inquiry into the Australian Tax Office. I believe we, as committee members, ought to be fair and impartial about the evidence that was brought before us. Every member of that Committee so far has approached that problem of trying to work out what should be done, what recommendations we ought to make, in a fair and impartial manner. I find it extraordinary that Senator Bishop, in her enthusiasm to pillory not only Mr Boucher but also other people in the Tax Office, should come in here tonight and make judgments about issues that have been before the Committee in the way that she has. The question of Mr Boucher's appointment to the OECD is not an issue we should be discussing here tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JE4">Senator AULICH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bishop says that we are not. She raised it. She once again did what I regard as a totally unacceptable thing; she has made a connection between the appointment of a particular officer to a very important position in Paris&mdash;and if she does not believe that the OECD position is important, she should say so now&mdash;and certain things that were done with the budget of the Australian Tax Office and its capacity to collect revenue. I do not think that that connection is an appropriate one. I think it is only fair that, as a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I make my views known here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honestly, I have applauded Senator Bishop on occasion for the tenacity with which she goes about her questioning. I have no problems with the fact that she will go on and on until she finds what she wants; or maybe sometimes she even finds the truth&mdash;and they are not always the same. The problem is that on the way there she happens to shoot the stage coach driver, the Indians on the side of the road, she burns the general store and she probably opens the gate to the fort to let the outlaws in&mdash;but at the end of the route she has got there. But it is the Bishop search-and-destroy method. We have burning villages left behind in her wake as she moves towards this ultimate goal of discovering the `truth', according to the Bishop&mdash;the Bishop truth. The Bishop truth sure enough sat around for 2,000 years in Rome, but it was not always right&mdash;and Senator Bishop is not always right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it ought to be on record tonight from at least one member of the Public Accounts Committee, so that the press in this place starts to understand, that we do not make judgments about very complicated issues, about people's reputations and we do not make connections between a post being given and revenues gained for government. We do not make those connections. If the press wants to make these connections because Senator Bishop is the most entertaining member of the Committee, that is fine. That is up to them; they can make those decisions. But I for one want to be on record tonight, as I was in the appropriate public hearings, as saying that when we&mdash;that is, most of the members of that Committee&mdash;make a judgment, it will be on the basis of the evidence and we will take time over it. I will not be rushing into this chamber to jump to conclusions and to cast aspersions on the reputation of an officer who has served the Public Service well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot go into the report. It is unfair for Senator Bishop to talk about some of the issues, to anticipate some possible recommendations of the Committee, some possible comments in the way that she has approached the subject tonight. I do not like to detain the Committee any longer at this time of night, but it must be put on the line that there are a number of approaches that can be taken in this inquiry by the Public Accounts Committee. There is an approach that should be taken in Estimates and the subsequent examinations that occur in this chamber. I do not think Senator Bishop has been taking the appropriate approach. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make two or three quick points. First, I was not at the private meeting this morning because I was at a meeting of the Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council. They were competing meetings. Secondly, the material I have dealt with tonight is on the public record and in no way foreshadows recommendations the PAC may bring down. Indeed, I brought Senator Aulich to order in saying that he must not discuss what was dealt with in that meeting this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, Senator Aulich was not in the chamber when I brought to the attention of the Senate the speech made&mdash;it had been supplied in the material which only became available today in any form whatsoever&mdash;in March 1992 by Mr Boucher. In that speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The outcome is that we have a Budget which in 1992/93 will not cover all of our salary needs.</PARA>
<PARA>For Senator Aulich's information, it is the same speech that said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our Budget shortfall is around $20 million out of a total salary and administrative budget of some $825 million.</PARA>
<PARA>I then dealt with the evidence that had been given by officers from the Tax Office in public hearings under oath and where they had to change what they said because it was wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Aulich can interpret whatever way he will the making of a wrong statement under oath to a committee, as indeed will other people. The fact of the matter is that when one looks at the shortfall in revenue, $3.4 billion; when one looks at the shortfall in amounts of money for budgeting to pay salaries; when one looks at the shortfall in the budget for 1992-93; when one looks at the $1.7 billion suddenly being found at the same time as $114 million was found, allegedly to pay for new staff which Mr Highfield admitted were not necessarily more staff at all; and when one looks at the conjunction of someone who was appointed for a seven-year term being not willing to answer questions about meetings that took place in Perth on 5 September, a series of meetings where these things were discussed, claiming executive and crown privilege, then I think there are many conclusions that can be drawn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us bear in mind the many ordinary Australians who experience the host of the bureaucracy coming down on them. For example, I refer to the 6,000 Australians who were last year prosecuted for failure to lodge their tax returns, when Mr Keating did not receive the same treatment. I refer to the same Australians who find that they have no redress and no money to fight matters through the courts&mdash;to people like Mr Clark who mortgaged his house to take the matter all the way through the Federal Court to finally win, but who will still be out of pocket. These are ordinary Australians&mdash;like the widow who could not find the money to pay income tax on her late husband's estate. Those are the sorts of people who find the might of the Tax Office oppressive and who want to see it accountable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would recommend to Senator Aulich that he read the Western Australian royal commissioner's report, which said that it was the Parliament that failed in its job and allowed that cosy relationship between the Executive and the bureaucracy to result in the scandalous fraud that happened in Western Australia. People blamed the Westminster system. I say to Senator Aulich: do not blame the Westminster system; blame the people in it. It will not happen here because there are people in the Public Accounts Committee on both sides who will be very sure that it will not. I am not foreshadowing a finding in a committee report, but I regard it as reasonable to want to look personally at the evidence that is on the record, and to draw conclusions from that about the mismanagement of the Tax Office. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I had the pleasure last night of meeting representatives of the OECD, who were delighted with the appointment by the Australian Government of its new Ambassador. In view of the importance of tax issues before the OECD, those senior officers of the OECD felt our new ambassador could make a significant contribution in enhancing the tax deliberations of the OECD, which is one of its most important functions for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, Senator Bishop refuses to accept&mdash;I thought for a long time she failed to understand it, but I do not want to underestimate her; I suspect that is not the case&mdash;that there was a shortfall, that arrangements have been made to cover it and that the enforcement strategy was not necessary for the Tax Office to deal with its salary funding over a number of years. I believe it has been adequately demonstrated that the Tax Office was in a position to manage the situation, to deal with the difficult situation that all large Australian Government entities who have had a dramatic reduction in staff turnover have had to manage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is just not helpful to throw around allegations of perjury and implications of other improper conduct without, in my view, having the evidence to lay the foundation for it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Starting with question No. 3, I asked how the Commissioner was alleging that no income producing assets were ever acquired, because the receivers of the Aust-Home group of companies were proceeding to realise the assets held by those companies. Quite clearly, there were assets held by the companies because the receivers were appointed to the assets of the companies by the Federal Court upon the application of the Australian Securities Commission. There is no doubt that there were assets held by the companies. That has been upheld by a court case and the receivers are now proceeding to realise those assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assets are also subject to charge. The mortgagees clearly recognise that the assets were acquired by the companies.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner does not agree with the view that the investors acquired an interest in the underlying property.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful to Senator McMullan for advising the Senate that he has assured himself that detailed investigations were made. Does that mean that the assessments, which were issued to investors generally, have not relied upon the Australian Taxation Office deeming the liability of certain of the investors? The basis of this scheme was that people were ostensibly paying money, by way of interest on loans, to acquire a beneficial interest in underlying assets. That led to those individuals claiming a variation of their PAYE deductions. That is a fairly simple to understand concept.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one case, I am advised of a gentleman who, for the life of the scheme&mdash;which I think was around about two years&mdash;claimed and received a PAYE instalment variation of $20 per week. Notwithstanding this, the gentleman in question has received a tax assessment requiring him to pay, I believe, in excess of $100,000 of tax and penalties thereon. I think it may even be as high as $200,000. I do not wish to go into the individual's case but, unless my mathematics is gravely flawed&mdash;and I am sure that if it were you, Mr Chairman, would pick me up, being the kind-hearted soul that you are&mdash;I am at a loss to understand how a person could claim and receive an instalment variation of $20 a week. Over two years, that works out at roughly $2,040 or $2,080 in instalment variations.

But it is inconsistent with the argument that the Taxation Office has issued its assessments based on detailed investigations. For that gentleman to have a tax liability in excess of $100,000&mdash;if one disregarded penalties, which could not accrue at more than 20 per cent per annum anyway&mdash;he would had to have been claiming almost $1,000 in instalment variations a week.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McMullan. As I said, I understand that part IVA of the Act is designed to strike down arrangements which were entered into for the primary purpose of avoiding liability for income taxation. In answer to question 1, the Tax Office has suggested that the investors generally may fall foul of the provisions of section 82KL and part IVA. Yet in answer to question No. 11, the Tax Office said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ATO is of the view that many of the Aust-Home investors did not understand the full tax implications of the arrangement. To this extent, it is accepted that they did not have the intention of deliberate tax evasion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In one answer, the Tax Office says that these people entered into a scheme for the purposes of avoiding taxation. However, further on in the answers, the Tax Office then says that these people did not have the intention of deliberately evading taxation. The two answers are quite contradictory. Obviously the Tax Office has not given proper consideration to these issues, because if the answers had been properly prepared, they would not contradict themselves within the space of 11 paragraphs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am trying to assist Senator McMullan by pointing out that there are very real doubts about the degree of proper examination that the Australian Taxation Office has given to this matter and the way in which it has formed the views it has and arrived at the answers. There are very proper concerns about the manner used to raise assessments against individual taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that it is very late, and I am sorry that we had to go through it in this detail, but all those things alarmed me greatly upon receiving the answers to the questions on notice. In conclusion, I hope that Senator McMullan and the Australian Taxation Office will go back and review the matter from the first issue that I raised this evening through to the last. The Australian Taxation Office clearly has flaws in its methodology and the basis on which it has arrived at the assessment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall be brief in making plain what I think of the administration of the Child Support Agency. If it has no discretion but to deal with this matter other than as it has, it is high time that we amended the Act. In fact, it is high time that we amended the Act for a whole range of other reasons, which I shall not go into tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What prompts me to speak particularly is the letter that I received from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) dated 30 October 1992 in response to two letters that I had written, dated 26 June 1992 and 4 September 1992. It would be tempting to go through the 50 pages of advice and correspondence, et cetera, that this constituent has had with the Child Support Agency. The first letter, which is dated 3 July 1990, relates to her difficulty in getting any support at all, any support for money that was owing to her and any real enforcement of maintenance against her former husband, who gave up his job. That is the situation to which I specifically refer. The Parliamentary Secretary said in his letter to me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a free society such as ours, a person cannot be compelled to remain in employment against his or her will.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not disagree with that. But what benefits is the husband now being paid as a result of him having decided that he will not work when he had a perfectly good job in a bank and because he does not want to pay his maintenance? I take issue with Senator McMullan over that statement when this man is allowed to give up work and not pay his children but get other benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This man deliberately walked away from supporting his children. I recognise that if he is not earning, maintenance cannot be further enforced against him. But the fact is that, prior to that, he had paid maintenance. As I said, I shall not go through the 50 pages which show what he had not paid earlier on. But Senator McMullan is now asking this constituent to repay a sum of money because, by some absurd formula, the Agency says that this man had paid more than he was supposed to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount he had paid over more than two years would not have fed or clothed a child or done anything for it. Now she gets this letter supported by the Parliamentary Secretary saying that she should repay some money to him. The Registrar explained it to her and she has been requested to repay an amount of child support she received because an overpayment resulted when Mr Fawcett's child support liability for 1991-92 was reduced on the basis of his estimated low income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He paid almost nothing during 1990 and now she is expected to take away from feeding her child $105 to repay him. If I have anything to do with it, she will not repay it. The authorities can put her in gaol and do what they like, but any system which has been put down by this Parliament in that form ought to be amended as a high priority, and well ahead of a lot of this other legislation that we have before us at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The documents from the Agency itself prove beyond doubt that this man did not intend to pay for his child's maintenance; he did not pay. Now and again he was forced to pay a bit and, because this absurd formula now works it out that over a whole year he paid $105 more than he had to, she has to find that money from goodness knows where and repay it. The Parliamentary Secretary said in his letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Registrar assured me that the Agency will reassess Mr Fawcett's child support liability if it is found that his actual income exceeds his estimated income. He suggested that Mrs Berger could inform the Agency if she has any further information regarding Mr Fawcett's employment or financial position.</PARA>
<PARA>He is still sponging off the system and refusing to pay for his child. Yet he wants $105 back from the amount that was paid at a time when he was not fully paying what he should have been paying to support his child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall not go into this matter further and if Senator McMullan does not understand what I am saying, I will be very surprised. I want an assurance that no action will be taken against this constituent to get $105 from her to pay back to Mr Fawcett, who very clearly has indicated not the slightest intention of trying to support his child whom he is legally obliged to support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have the letter and undoubtedly the matter can be pursued. There are problems with the Child Support Agency and the Act. In my view, the formula needs to be reviewed. Its present operation is grossly unfair to a number of men when a woman is earning and has other assets which are not taken into account. There are also cases where maintenance is not being enforced properly and a woman is being disadvantaged. I agree totally that there is difficulty in both instances. However, I think of a situation in Perth that I have written about&mdash;and there are others&mdash;where the actions of the Agency have caused real problems between the parties. It is not just between former husbands and wives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final point on this matter is that the Agency busily wrote a letter saying it wanted $105, but unless the arrears are in the vicinity of $5,000 the Agency will not lift a finger or a pen to enforce them because it says it is not worth it: the sum is not large enough. How is it that the Agency cannot, or will not, enforce a payment unless the sum is large, yet it will take off after this women for $105? It does not add up to a sensible situation. </PARA>

There are these types of debt management strategies in the Australian Taxation Office proper but they are not supposed to operate in the Child Support Agency. That is what I would be concerned about. It is difficult for me to understand the underpinning of the $105 concern, but I would be very concerned with a case in which the Agency was saying that it would not pursue an outstanding matter because the amount owing was not sufficiently large. That is not acceptable to the Government and it is not the policy of the Agency. I am aware of a number of instances where amounts smaller than that have been pursued, and properly so. I assure the honourable senator that the problem lies not in the $105 but in the $1,500.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The remarks my colleagues have made cover most of the issues pretty well. As usual, when the debate gets a bit hot, Senator Kernot walks out. But Senator Kernot and her colleagues have brought this on themselves. Year after year the Government has brought in Bills and they have been guillotined through. The Government has held up these Bills until the very last moment and then suddenly, knowing it can rely on the Australian Democrats, it has brought in these Bills in a rush and in the end the Democrats will guillotine them through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with the Democrats is quite simple: this new lot of Democrats has no concept of what this Parliament is about. Why should senators not come into this chamber and carefully debate the Bills, in some cases for very long periods of time? These are very important Bills. They affect the lives of millions of people. Why should we not expect to come into this chamber and carefully consider these Bills so that the Government is put to the test? I would have thought that `accountability' was the key word for the Australian Democrats. They have often told us over the years that their job is to keep us all honest. An essential part of honesty is making sure that the legislation the Government brings down is examined carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be a few Democrats in their rooms who are not sleeping at the moment and who are listening to this debate. Why is it so essential to get these Appropriation Bills through today? Why is it absolutely vital that this be done? The answer is: the Government wants it done; the Government wants to keep its options open to call an election on Monday. This program, which was so essential and which we had to rush through this chamber, will then be junked in one minute. That is what this is about. The Australian Democrats should get back to their roots, have a good think about what their philosophy is, and demand more accountability from the Government rather than demanding that the coalition rush these Bills through. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A question was answered regarding the investigation of the near miss of a BAE 146 at Meekatharra. I believe the question was, `Was the pilot Australian trained?' and the answer was, `Yes, he was'. I would like to follow on and ask a question about the same area. There was a hoax report that a 146 had crashed some time back. This false report was reported by the ABC and also GWN at the time in Western Australia. I would like to know what action, if any, the relevant section of the Department has taken with the ABC for reporting such a would-be disaster as a crash of a 146 supposedly carrying 100 passengers without having been in contact with the organisation one is supposed to contact in such matters&mdash;the Civil Aviation Authority?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The relevant statutory authority in this case is the ABC which, I understand, carried the false report of an aircraft accident. If I recall, Senator Panizza may have asked this question of Senator Collins in Question Time at about the time of the Senate Estimates Committee's hearing. I think he obtained a reply from Senator Collins which was incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> at the end of a Question Time. I think Senator Collins took it on notice and replied later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the Civil Aviation Authority is concerned, it was not in any way involved in any hoax. The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, which is the agency covered in these Estimates and which would investigate an accident if one occurred, is not involved in any hoax. So no authority is implicated in the hoax call under these Estimates. It seems to me a problem for the ABC, which received and broadcast something. I do not know what the answer to Senator Panizza's question was that Senator Collins tabled, but I am sure that has answered it. In short, we cannot, on behalf of the CAA or BASI, comment on that, because it is not something that falls within the purview of those operations. </PARA>

I thought that since then the Minister's Department might have taken it up with the ABC&mdash;even had a friendly chat on the telephone, for that matter&mdash;to make sure that it did not happen again. I was astounded that such a false report could have been broadcast. One might expect this from some downtown commercial broadcasting outfit or televising outfit, but when it comes to the almighty ABC, I just cannot understand it. I thought that the Minister's Department and the departmental section might have taken it up with the ABC just as a matter of interest, which would have followed on from what Senator Collins told me at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have several matters that relate to this particular issue. The first one relates to the airline tenancies and concession arrangements for the air terminals in Darwin and Alice Springs. I asked a series of questions in the Estimates on 8 September, and several of the questions were taken on notice at that particular time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a saga of events around the relocations of the new terminals and the small business operators in the general aviation areas at Darwin Airport. I am very pleased to note the assurance of the Government that there have been absolutely no changes in any of the proposed leases from those originally offered at the Darwin terminal. I received a one word answer to that&mdash;the word was `no'. Given the history of the initial development of the Darwin and Alice Springs terminals, I would be very concerned to learn at any stage that any of the leases or concession arrangements at either the Darwin or Alice Springs airports had in fact been changed from those indicated at the Estimates Committee some time earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Answers came back with regard to the Darwin aviation club and its relocation and also the relocations of various general aviation operators from the south side to the north side of the Darwin Airport. The original date for relocation to the north side was March 1992. That was extended to September 1992 and the arrangements are now in place for operators to complete relocation prior to December 1992, with the possible exception of one or two operators whose construction completion dates may extend to January 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can I, therefore, seek an assurance from the Minister that there will be no operators or concessionaires operating on the south side of the Darwin airport after January 1993, that all locations of operators will be facilitated by that date, and that all locations on the south side of the Darwin airport will revert to the Department of Defence as at that date?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just make one aspect of this clear from the beginning. The FAC, like the Civil Aviation Authority, is a commercialised government business enterprise, and it is managed by a board appointed by the Government, expert in the management of business. It is a GBE which registers with the Government its corporate plan and we approve that. The Minister for Finance is the responsible Minister in that action, in consultation with me. We exact a dividend from it. But we are not in a position to direct the FAC as to the manner in which it carries out its commercial responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling said he was pleased to have had an assurance from the Government with reference to a question he asked. I think what he probably meant to say was that he had an assurance from the FAC, because I am not in a position to give an assurance of that nature. It is for the FAC to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now have a question before me from Senator Tambling asking for the Government to say something. I can refer Senator Tambling's question to the FAC to see whether it is in a position to answer. I think I may have some advice from it. If I am right in understanding this&mdash;this is the FAC's advice and I am a mere conduit&mdash;the advice is that the aeroclub at Darwin is to move to the north side on 21 November this year. Some construction works may extend beyond January 1993 due to construction delays which are not FAC delays. That may go to the point of the assurance that Senator Tambling wants. I indicate again that this is FAC advice. I make an offer that if there are detailed questions on how the FAC intends to manage its operational responsibilities, perhaps we can arrange for Senator Tambling to meet with the FAC and have those questions pursued. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the offer from the Minister and I will no doubt take that up. The Minister answered in respect of the Darwin aviation club. My question was more specific in that it affected all general aviation operators currently operating on the south side of the airport. I would ask him to qualify that particular point. I do see an involvement of the Government because of the nature of the arrangements on the south side of the airport which will revert to use by the Department of Defence. Given that there has had to be considerable liaison, I would ask whether the Department of Defence is planning, in conjunction with the FAC, to take over and facilitate any of the building works or the remnant buildings on the south side of the airport.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am not required to give my assent to any joint venturing by the FAC. The FAC is obliged under, I think, section 10 of the Act to advise me. Because it is a commercialised venture and it is to trade commercially and succeed in delivering the dividend, it is not in a position to obtain from me under its Act assent to do certain commercial things. It is expected to use normal commercial judgment and business acumen in order to make the right decisions within the ambit of its Act. But it is obliged to keep me informed. It is not a question of me, as a Minister, imposing on it a Public Service obligation of some sort in this manner.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue that was of concern to me on this matter was what I regarded at that time and still regard&mdash;and what others regarded&mdash;as a potential, if not actual, conflict of interest in the FAC being both a concessionaire and the body which awards concessions at its airports. The matter under consideration was the Airport Fine Foods operation. At the hearings and also in the supplementary answers that have been provided, the FAC continues to assert that there is no conflict of interest because it claims that it is not in fact a concessionaire, even though it was approached by Australian Fine Foods to take part in that operation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note from the subsequent answer that has been provided that, in fact, the FAC holds some 52.5 per cent of the shares in Airport Fine Foods. As Senator Bishop says, that, in fact, indicates that it is the majority shareholder in this business operation. It seems to me that the further argument which the FAC uses in denying that there is a conflict of interest is that it bought into the business as a going concern, so there seems to be some convoluted argument that the concession had already been given to the business before the FAC became involved and, therefore, there is no conflict of interest if the FAC subsequently becomes involved in such a business. I find that argument unacceptable and I believe it is simply not acceptable for the FAC to be involved in businesses at a location which it itself controls, particularly when those concessions are not put out to tender. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter of concern which I want to raise is that when I asked these questions on 8 September, the FAC indicated that it was not aware of any concern from other concessionaires about a conflict of interest; yet its subsequent answer to those questions taken on notice indicates that only two weeks later, on 23 September, it admits that it had become aware of some concerns about the tender process for concessions. So, I think that also raises questions about the FAC's handling of this particular matter, that within that relatively short period, it suddenly became aware that there were concerns about the tender process for concessions and it was aware that, in fact, there was a view among other concessionaires that there was a conflict of interest involved in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I would really simply seek a more substantive explanation and argument to convince me that there is, in fact, not a conflict of interest involved in this particular matter when the FAC indeed owns some 52.5 per cent of a business that is located at its own airport, an airport where it has control of who the concessionaires become. </PARA>

If the FAC had been a privatised government business enterprise, it would be, of course, a private company and all of the questions that have been raised by Senator Chapman would not be questions that could be directed at the FAC, unless it was in some investigative role in terms of its own commercial conduct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAC is, of course, a commercialised business of the Government and, as I have explained before, it is not a business over which the Government has any power of direction in the conduct of its commercial business activities. If it contravenes any law or legislation, well, it ought to be dealt with just the same as any other business that has contravened any law or legislation. The FAC Act&mdash;and this was made specific in the second reading speech to the Bill at the time&mdash;states that it was envisaged that the FAC would compete in the private sector; that the FAC could form partnerships and establish subsidiaries under the Act; and that this is, in fact, similar to what occurs at airports in other countries, where they are under commercial management.

It is still, in effect, a government owned instrumentality. By this process of so-called commercialisation, it has this quasi-business status, but it does not have the status of a real commercial operation.

That question was not answered by the FAC on the grounds that it is commercial-in-confidence. That simply highlights the discrepancy that we find in these sorts of operations. Whenever they do not want to answer a question, they claim commercial-in-confidence.

As Senator Chapman pointed out, the FAC is a GBE and also a privatised corporation. As I interjected, I maintain that it is a corporatised GBE, but there is still a contingent liability. If the FAC were to go into liquidation, run up a lot of debts, there is no doubt that the taxpayer would pick up the final tab after the liquidation of whatever assets it had. I cannot understand being told that the information was commercial-in-confidence when I had already been told that the figure was $4m. The reason I asked that question was to compare Compass with Ansett. When I asked how much Ansett owed the FAC in December 1991, Mr Thompson replied:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is fair to say that all the people who operate on our airports owe us money. Nobody is exactly up to date.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am asked by Senator Bishop to differentiate between two arrangements that the FAC has made. I am not in a position to make that distinction.

It is in a position of being able to enter into commercial arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where there are private parties involved in that, doubtless the issue of the rights of the private party in partnership with the FAC arises.

It may be that that private party in its own right would be prepared to answer questions of the character that have been put to the FAC, but it may not be.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that answer makes out Senator Chapman's point very well. That is classic gobbledegook. Senator Chapman made an excellent point. The FAC is simply a function of government which has been hived off in a corporate structure. The people who were previously bureaucrats have been told to go out and play being businessmen. We do not make a manager by saying, `Tomorrow you will be one'. There are people heading up this organisation who, quite frankly, have the sort of background that would not earn them that job in the private sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental difference between a private sector organisation and this hybrid character that this Government has created is, simply, that shareholders in the private sector are free to invest their money or not invest their  money in that corporation as they see fit. If they do not like the way that corporation is run, they may take their money out and leave that corporation. Things in the public sector are funded by the compulsory acquisition of funds by way of taxation, which people are not permitted to opt out of. The Government decides where taxpayers' money is put and then the bureaucrats administer it. The FAC is a public sector entity, and as such is subject to public sector criteria. It is simply not an answer to pretend by some sort of legal fiction that it has become a private sector enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The day it is sold off and has shareholders and directors who are answerable to those shareholders, instead of this quaint practice of the Government being the shareholder, that is the day we can say it is truly a commercial enterprise. In the interim, as Senator Chapman aptly pointed out, if the FAC goes to the wall, the taxpayer picks up the tab. Therefore, it is indeed in the taxpayer's interest to know the way in which this body conducts its affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that concerns me and an enormous number of people who are truly private sector businessmen is the manner in which the FAC has become renowned, if not notorious, for litigation. I turn to that section in the answers given concerning legal actions that I asked for. To say that these answers would mislead a reasonable man reading them is to put it mildly. My question, as recorded on page 345, was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How many legal actions were the FAC involved in last year?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the 1991/92 year, the Corporation was involved in 7 significant legal actions including: . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I did not ask that; I asked how many actions it was involved in. The answer continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the defendant in three significant civil claims (over $100,000) for damages (there have been only three such claims since 1988) . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The major complaint against the FAC is not that it is very often the defendant, but that it is all too often a plaintiff. I will give honourable senators an example of the nature of the litigious action the FAC indulges in. It was a plaintiff before the District Court, and I have a list covering the year 1991 of a total of 25 cases which were listed before that Court. The District Court is not a small debts court but a court of significant jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAC appeared as a plaintiff before the Supreme Court of New South Wales in 1991. One case dated from 1990 and it was a plaintiff in one case and a defendant in two cases. The FAC was a plaintiff before the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court and a plaintiff before the Equity Division in a case in 1992. It was a defendant in one case and a plaintiff in two others, and it appeared before the Court of Appeal. The FAC has appeared in a total of nine cases before the Supreme Court of New South Wales since 1988. It has cases before the Federal Court of Australia dating from 1988 to 1992&mdash;a total of 13 cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that the answers far from reflected the truth. I note that when we come to the question of Multicon Engineering the following very quaint answer was given:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During 1991/92, approximately $2.2m was expended on legal actions. Most of this amount was expended in defending one claim against the Corporation for $9.5m by Multicon Engineering Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA>As I understand it, the claim was in the vicinity of $26m and the company has made every endeavour to settle that claim. At every turn there has been obfuscation by the FAC which has resulted in a quasi arbitration proceeding being dragged out until the judge concerned had to haul it over the coals to bring it to some sort of sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimate of the industry as a whole is that the FAC is a highly litigious organisation which settles at the court date after millions of dollars have been wasted in legal fees, even where settlement has been negotiated and there is an overriding factor by the board. Quite frankly, for the Minister to say that the FAC is at arm's length and he has no responsibility when it is the taxpayer who will pick up the tab if these people fall over, simply is not good enough. I ask the Minister to go back to his officers and ask them to give me a proper answer to the questions I asked and a proper estimate of the money they spent last year on legal actions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bishop has raised a number of matters. Taking them in sequential order, I start with Senator Bishop's observation about the management of the FAC. As I have said in my earlier answers, the FAC is set up under an Act of parliament and is a commercialised government business enterprise. It registers its corporate plan with the Government, pays a dividend and is governed by a board with considerable commercial expertise. To characterise it as a body of bureaucrats is probably unfair to bureaucrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, people with private sector experience constitute something like 70 per cent of its managerial structure. I am never quite sure how precisely bureaucrats are described in their daily functions, but one would expect bureaucrats to have a management role and one would expect that public sector bureaucrats ought to be able to manage with the same level of competence and expertise as private sector bureaucrats in large organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAC is run not as a Public Service department, but as a commercial company. It has an AA-plus rating on the credit market. It does not have loans that are guaranteed by the Government. It is a very sound organisation. It pays its own taxation to the Government. I understand that $150m worth of its bonds were sold in 30 minutes to the private sector capital market. That is some sort of indication that, in private sector eyes, this is a worthwhile organisation to buy bonds from and in which to put money. To characterise the FAC as some poor commercial relation is not fair at all. It is a well conducted and respected business in a truly commercial sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move to the issue of litigation. I am not quite sure what the point of these questions is. Any business conducting itself on the scale that the FAC does&mdash;particularly as the FAC is a major client of building companies&mdash;is embroiled in litigation from time to time. The FAC owns, operates and constructs where necessary additions to airports. If one travels around this country&mdash;and all of us in this chamber do&mdash;one will see that there is not a single airport that currently does not have a wing under construction. That is some indication of the amount of construction that the FAC contracts construction companies to undertake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is also fair to say that anyone in the business of building is usually embroiled in contract litigation of some form or another at some time or other. A characteristic of the building industry is the tendency to have a higher level of litigation over contracts compared with other industries. Nothing can be drawn from whether or not the FAC is a defendant or a plaintiff in a particular case. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is nothing to be drawn from that. If people are engaged in commercial practice, their commercial interests are being injured at law and they do not exercise their rights to take action, they could be regarded as negligent in their responsibility. If people were the subject of action and did not defend themselves they could be considered equally negligent. I do not find that there is any particular ministerial responsibility as to whether or not the FAC conducts itself properly in defending itself. Its reputation is certainly that of a well run organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We turn now to the last matter that Senator Bishop raised: Multicon&mdash;I think that is what the name of the company was. I have no particular knowledge of this case. But I do not know in what role Senator Bishop rises in this chamber to allege certain things about the FAC's conduct toward Multicon.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One really does wish that Senator Collins were back on the job. The reason I rose to speak about, in particular, the Multicon issue is that I have here a document called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Airport International Terminal stage 1 expansion structural steel contract TC08 settlement presentation</EMPHASIS>&mdash;in other words, in every endeavour to settle this matter which is wasting millions of dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a document which I think has been sent to me out of some form of desperation by parties. I have had senior businessmen from many areas come to see me because simply they find that the new form of contract which the FAC has drawn up for itself, which is different from the one that is in operation internationally, has resulted in it being interpreted by the FAC in a highly litigious manner. If one compares the actions of the FAC with those of any other corporation, one finds that they are way outside the manner in which any other organisation operates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The really interesting thing about the complaints that have come to me concerning the litigious nature of the FAC is that they have not come from one source. They have come from a whole area of sources&mdash;all very senior people; all with genuine complaints. I refer to complaints concerning the awarding of a contract. I have asked previously the question about the way in which expressions of interest are registered whereby, under the way things are operated, one gets the situation where one can simply ask one's first best friend, one's second best friend, someone who is hopeless and someone who is an international and does not meet the ANZ Australian criteria, and guess what: the first best friend gets the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There are so many areas where the procurement process&mdash;the operations&mdash;need to be subject to scrutiny. The thing that is so wrong with regard to the Federal Airports Corporation, in particular&mdash;and there are others as well&mdash;is that it is quite powerful because it has the monopoly; it has the ability to make and break corporations. It is acting in a way which the general business community considers to be unacceptable, and yet it is all overseen and backed up by the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not matter what funny legal fictions we have put in place; that the Government is the shareholder; that it gets a dividend from its operations that is paid into Consolidated Revenue&mdash;all of those things do not matter. At the end of the day, if the FAC gets it wrong, even if the Government has been standing at arm's length, if it louses it up and goes broke, it is ordinary Australians that pick up the tab and have to pay out the creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the FAC is subject, or ought to be subject, to scrutiny and accountability. But, at every turn, while we seek to ask about the manner in which the tender process or the expression of interest process is used, the manner in which the FAC enters into so-called joint ventures because it looks like somebody might fall over, the way it issues a contract and then deals with variations under a contract which it has drawn up for itself all by itself and which is not shared in common with any other country, all these quaint practices which the FAC has developed for itself, under the Government's rules, say that it is not subject to scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not on. As I said, the test is: if it falls over and they get it wrong, Joe Blow, the taxpayer, is the one who pays. And it is a monopoly; it is powerful; it has the ability to keep people out; it has the ability to determine the way things occur. Very simply, in our system of democracy, if this Parliament is not vigilant and insistent upon answers, the sorts of answers that Senator Chapman was asking for earlier, that Senator Panizza has been asking for and that the business people have come to me for because they feel it is just not being handled correctly, have to be answered. If the Minister is just going to be a puppet and stand up and say, `I am sure they are doing it nicely, because they are independent; they are jolly good managers', and if that is his idea of accountability, then we are all in trouble. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. I mentioned the timing of this before, and it appears to me that the FAC is not quite as commercial yet in its outlook as it might be. Perhaps it is not aware that the Tasmanian tourist industry has had I think the worst year it has had for years and years and that people are still on the verge of going broke. I say that very advisedly. My family is in the tourist industry so I know only too well, although it is not involved in car hire. Right around the State people have been suffering very badly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The timing of an introduction of increased charges seems to me quite incredible. The major supplier, if you like, of tourists to Tasmania has been Victoria. I would have hoped that the Minister would have understood by now that people in Victoria have either lost their jobs or are terrified that they are going to. They are not taking holidays, and they have not been doing so for a year or two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the FAC to suddenly come in, having the monopoly over the facility, and start jacking up prices to hire car operators in a very depressed market strikes me as stupid in the extreme. People in that position should be looking to carry their small business contacts for as long as they can afford to do so&mdash;I recognise they are meant to be commercial&mdash;if they want the whole business to survive. We have already a year or two ago seen a disastrous business bust in the hire car industry in our State. We do not want to see more and I would have thought that this was a very inopportune time to suddenly turn around and hoist a whole lot of new charges on the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad the Minister has said that perhaps wiser counsel may be prevailing. However, from what the Minister has said I do not have enough detail to know whether in fact it is very wise counsel. I do not know how much gentler the FAC is going to be on its small business operators, but it certainly has not shown much nous in the way it has approached this issue at this time in a very sensitive industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope my words are being taken with some seriousness because they are not said lightly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The development of the FAC's discussion paper is to take account of precisely the concerns Senator Newman has raised. Nothing has been finalised, although it is the intention of the FAC to deal with the issue of the ongoing terms of contracts by the end of the year rather than continue to roll over the contracts that were expired in October.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps I should also say that if the FAC were privatised, as is the Opposition's policy, it would be operating on commercial lines and it would doubtless be going through the same sorts of contract renewal discussions as the FAC in its commercialised form. I would hope that the FAC, having the Government as the shareholder, does consider weightily the impact on its local commercial partners or its lessees in terms of airport operation. But I think there is an obligation on it, too, to distinguish its commercial operation from a community service obligation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is a community service obligation plea being entered here&mdash;I am not sure there is and I am not necessarily inviting one, but I take on board the seriousness of what Senator Newman has said&mdash;then I think that should be distinguished because I think it would be unfair to say to the FAC, `Operate commercially, but observe at the same time some community service obligation'. That would mean it could not take commercial decisions in the case of the smaller ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am making is that this is a horse of an entirely different colour. I also point out that if the Opposition's privatisation commitment were honoured by a government, there would be no dimension or consideration for a community service obligation in a case like this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I do appreciate the difficulties in Tasmania. We only want to see that the best happens in that State, that the tourist industry is revived. I am sure it is true, as Senator Newman has said, that Victorians, Tasmania's major supplier to the tourist market, are worried at the present time. If I were in Victoria at the present time I would be worried.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a long running saga. It was originally promised that the report would be available in August, then September, and then October elapsed. In spite of many requests to the Minister's office, he has persistently failed to explain to the Senate what the cause of delay is.

It is not a report that I am responsible for commissioning. It is a report that the board of the CAA is responsible for commissioning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The board has consulted me about issues such as terms of reference, the reporter and access to information, and I have been kept thoroughly briefed. Indeed, I have from time to time said things on behalf of the board on the public record. The board will make the report available to me as soon as it is available to the board. I have indicated that when that occurs, at the first opportunity, I will release it and table it in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding is that the report has been found to be more complex and time consuming than originally imagined. Certainly there was a concern at the beginning of the inquiry that the terms of reference be wide enough to anticipate any matters that might be generally brought forward under the rubric of the inquiry. That has meant that there has been a very thorough canvassing of a wide range of issues relating to the radar contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conducting the inquiry it has been necessary to go back and check matters after subsequent information has been found to have raised further questions that initially were not anticipated. There has been quite a bit of toing and froing as well. I understand that the report is in the concluding stages. I am advised by the CAA that it expects the report to be made available to me by about the end of this month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a report or an inquiry that this Senate has raised. It is not one that the executive in this case has raised.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For what it is worth, I want to make some very brief comments about ABC regional radio services. Again I make the point that those officers who are waiting outside have only the Australian Democrats to blame for this appalling misuse of their time. If the Democrats had any thought for the parliamentary institutions they would not be trying to make us work through a number of very serious matters at this hour of the morning, keeping those officers waiting around. It is an absolutely disgraceful and atrocious display from a group which was supposed to be here to keep parliament operating honestly. It is no wonder that their vote is as low as it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) to some answers that were given to me in response to my questions on notice about the value of different properties in the north of Queensland. I refer the Minister to some of the properties which the ABC has bought, apparently in line with reducing its costs or in order to use resources more efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1986 the ABC bought some land in Cairns for $300,000 and put a new building on it at a cost of $772,000. It sold some of the surplus land. I am told by the ABC that the current value of the whole site is $764,000. If one adds the first two figures together, one will see that the ABC paid more than $1m for a property that is now worth $764,000. It certainly has not been a very good commercial deal. Similarly, in Mount Isa the ABC upgraded the studios for $336,000 and the land was valued at $32,000. Even adding just those two figures together, that is a $368,000 investment in the Mount Isa studios which are currently valued at only $327,000. Again, that was a fairly poor investment by the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That sort of supports the point that I am trying to make, which is that there seems to be some lack of management ability in the ABC in commercial areas. Most of the commercial radio stations lease premises because they find that commercially most attractive. But for some reason, this does not seem to apply to the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the answers given in writing which suggest that it is difficult to move and that there is a lot of equipment in the studios. I again say that leasing is good enough for the commercial stations and one wonders why it is not good enough for the ABC. One then wonders about the ABC protests about a cutback in funds. Should not more be directed at the lack of real commercial management in the way that it operates rather than a lack of funds?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite capable of reading the answer, even at 10 past 2 in the morning. But the answer says that the equipment has been tested and issued. To my knowledge, it has not been installed. It might have been issued somewhere along the line but, to my knowledge, it has not been installed in Western Australia. So I want to know whether it has been installed and whether it is working. Furthermore, I find the attitude of the Minister quite surprising, because it is a legitimate question.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macdonald wanted the answer, and I will give it to him. I am answering his question; he should let me answer it. It will only take a minute. The very first representation I ever made to a Federal Labor Minister in this Government as the then Leader of the Opposition in the Northern Territory was for the installation of SBS in Darwin. Mr Duffy had been sworn in as a Minister on Friday and I was in his office on the following Monday making those representations. That was 10 years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can say is, comprehensively, that I reject the assertions that Senator Macdonald has made that this is some sort of private perk that I have organised for Darwin because of my position as Minister. The provision of SBS to Darwin, which is something the SBS itself has long wanted, has been in progression now for at least a decade. It will be very welcome when it arrives in Darwin. Townsville is on the agenda for 1994. We are constantly seeking, within the constraints of the global budgetary restrictions, to advance whenever and wherever we can the extension of the SBS network&mdash;and that includes to places such as Townsville. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It comes under subprogram 2.2. The Minister would certainly have heard of the problems with the Aboriginal radio stations in the Kimberley. There is one in Kununurra, one in Halls Creek, one in Fitzroy and one in Derby. In fact, there is a delegation at Parliament House today. They are running out of funds at this stage. These four stations are operating approximately 10 hours a week. It seems to me that the argument concerning the funding is between ATSIC and the radio stations, because ATSIC obviously gets a global budget and broadcasting is under that. Not long ago I spent a week in the area, which was when I first heard about this matter, and I spoke to those concerned again today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister to give me a solution to this problem. If he is interested in listening, I will give him my own solution. I believe there should be an ongoing radio service to promote Aboriginal culture and spread the health message. I know that the radio stations need approximately three-quarters of a million dollars in extra funding to see this year out. This Government will not be in office at the time of the next Budget, but if we were unlucky enough to still have a Labor Government, would it be possible to take an amount of money out of ATSIC's budget and put it into the Department of Transport and Communications to permit an ongoing funding for those radio stations? I think there are three FM stations and one AM station in the area. Perhaps it could be cut back to only two AM stations. They could then have an ongoing budget and would know what to do in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The indigenous broadcasting services that operate in Australia do provide a very important service, and there are many of them. The Federal Government currently funds Aboriginal broadcasting to the tune of $12m a year. A great deal of support is given to it. The ultimate solution is simply more money, and it does not really change the position whether it is taken out of DOTAC and put it into ATSIC, or whether it is taken out of ATSIC and put into DOTAC. At the end of the day it comes fundamentally from Consolidated Revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very aware of the situation of the Kimberley broadcasters. In a general sense, ATSIC has recognised the problem itself and has set up a specialist group to advise it on broadcasting. In fact, I will be meeting with the chairman of that group when I open a broadcasting conference in Albury tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that ATSIC does have to set priorities in terms of its spending, and those priorities do have to be balanced as any other organisation has to balance priorities. I am advised that one of the difficulties is at regional council level. Some of the regional councillors do not place as high a priority on broadcasting services as they do on the provision of other services such as housing, health and so on. The Federal Government is anxious to assist in this process, and at the moment we are looking at what can be done in the interim for the Kimberley broadcasters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the solution at the end of the day is the one that ATSIC itself has adopted; that is, it has recognised the growing number of Aboriginal broadcasters who are proliferating around Australia at the moment and the fact that there needs to be a cohesive national policy for ATSIC to structure the funding for them. At the end of the day those priorities&mdash;rightly, in my view&mdash;have to be set by the ATSIC commissioners. I know that the primary purpose of the delegation's visit to Canberra is to discuss these issues with the ATSIC commissioners. </PARA>

Effectively, using that averaging which would be more or less accurate&mdash;it is obviously not 100 per cent accurate&mdash;the complaints in relation to this program equated to an average of more than two-thirds of the complaints received during that three-month period.</PARA></TALK.START>

I personally know a number of members of the Tribunal who were on the Tribunal at that time and, indeed, know that they are parents, but Mr Webb in fact declined to provide that information&mdash;not the Government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is wrong to make value judgments about a person's capacity to be a fit member of a body rated by the number of children that that person has.

Indeed, Senator Harradine, who asked the question, would have to concede that, if that was a standard that was applied fairly, then the Pope certainly and everyone of his clergy throughout the world, who, in my view, rightly and often express views on these subjects, would be struck in an instant and would not be qualified to express any view on these matters. As Senator Chapman and Senator Harradine know, the Catholic bishops of Australia, the Pope himself and many of the Catholic clergy in Australia, who are celibate, regularly and routinely and, indeed, topically at this moment, express many views, a lot of which I agree with, on this subject. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to refer to the questions on notice that I asked with regard to consultations between the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department regarding the use of the CAA tower in Alice Springs, which is now used for transmission services. I have received two very lengthy answers to a series of questions and, of course, the Minister would be well aware that this has been a saga that has now extended for some considerable period of time&mdash;in fact, a number of years. I think I started raising it 12 or 18 months ago in the Estimates committees, as a result of representations from the then Mayor of Alice Springs, Mrs Leslie Oldfield, who was extremely frustrated, as a member of the National Advisory Council of the ABC, at not being able to get the adequate and proper services that ought to have been extended to the Alice Springs community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lengthy answers that I received are very comprehensive but basically they come down to the line that there has been a degree of technical problem which has resulted in considerable delays in getting an interim solution. I received in my Canberra office yesterday a fax from the National Transmission Agency dated 9 November 1992. The General Manager of the NTA advised me that the proposal for a multichannel antenna mounted on the CAA tower has been approved, subject to its not imposing any restrictions on the CAA's use of the facility, and that the facility is currently scheduled for completion by August 1993 at the latest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, given the qualification in that letter, that approval is subject to its not imposing any restrictions on the CAA's use of the facility, I would like to ascertain what may arise in regard to that qualification and whether we are going to see a continuation of the problems of the last couple of years in that regard. In the final paragraph of Mr Jones's letter of 9 November the statement is made that, in the meantime, FM transmissions of ABC Radio National commenced in Alice Springs on an interim basis on 28 September 1992 and the commercial radio station 8HA-8SUN also commenced interim transmissions on the same date. I would like to ascertain on what basis the interim transmissions will be continued and whether they are likely to be subject to any interruption, cancellation or interference. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question with respect to the CAA is simply one of potential radio interference. We all hope that that will not occur, but that reservation has to be made. I might add that these things are not unusual and routinely have to be sorted out. Indeed, the only remaining obstacle to the commencement of the SBS service in Darwin is negotiations over the location of the transmission tower. There is no question that the CAA was correct on this. At the original site it would have interfered with wet season landings at Darwin Airport. It would have required a very high percentage of the aircraft to use instruments to land, which would have delayed services at Darwin. On this occasion, it is a question of potential radio interference from the signals that are operating. In respect of the interim transmissions, I am advised that they will be allowed to continue until there is a permanent resolution of the transmission problem.</PARA></TALK.START>

The answer I got explained amongst other things that remote areas are hardly the place for mobile phone cells. I was also told that, in considering the expansion of mobile phone coverage, each area is considered on its business merits. The major factors are population density, customer demand, volume of traffic and the cost to install the necessary base stations. I thought I would get a figure on what the population density has to be within the coverage area, what the volume of through traffic has to be, and an estimation of the cost to install the necessary base station to provide coverage in that area.

The figure that I just gave was in fact a dollar figure for the average cost of the installation of the service, and that is between $250,000 and $500,000. The officer has advised that, again in rough terms, the sort of town that would justify, commercially, such a service, would be a town about the size of Alice Springs&mdash;that is, about 25,000 people. In terms of these smaller centres, I have also been advised that, as the network is rolled out in a particular area, it is possible to pick up those smaller communities. The cost of the provision of the whole service to the area then becomes marginally, on a unit basis, cheaper. I also make the obvious point that this is a highly profitable and rapidly growing service. I would like to assure Senator Panizza that one does not need to give the slightest encouragement to the people fiercely competing for this business to provide the service, if there is a demand for it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. I had a question on notice asking why the estimate for expenditure on the road safety improvement package increased by 110 per cent, and I have got the answer. The answer included the fact that the Federal Government allocated an additional $70m to the Federal blackspot program in its February 1992 One Nation package. An amount of $25m was expended in 1991-92 and $60m is in the 1992 Budget. What is the progress of spending of that $70m in this blackspot program, and what increase has there been in employment due to that program?</PARA></TALK.START>

The Tasmanian and the balance of the Queensland programs were received in the last week. I dare say that approval is not far way for that. Could I say at this juncture that I join the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) in congratulating the Government of the Northern Territory in being able to spend this money faster than any other government in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did hear the Minister say that the whole of that $70m, or whatever it was, had been allocated, but `allocated' and `spent' do not have quite the same meaning. The idea of allocating it was not only to cut down the number of blackspots but to improve blackspots. To my knowledge this year&mdash;speaking for Western Australia, anyhow&mdash;there have been a record number of fatal accidents to date. I was wondering not only whether it has been allocated but whether it has been spent and how many jobs have been created. The idea in the One Nation package was to create extra jobs, and I would like to know whether extra jobs were created for the unemployed or whether the money merely went to contractors that had people employed anyhow.</PARA></TALK.START>

He did say that the Northern Territory Government has spent all of its allocation, presumably on roads. I believe the Northern Territory Government is the most efficient maker of roads. We were told when we were up there that the Northern Territory is 35 per cent more efficient than any other State. I would like to know how much has been expended on roads, as against how much has been allocated.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise a few general matters relating to the report&mdash;in particular, the question of witnesses appearing before the Committee. Although it is not listed on the running sheet, it is a matter raised in the Committee's report. I understand that we are entitled to discuss here questions raised in the Committee's report. I particularly want to express my concern about the manner in which the Senate treats its departmental and agency witnesses. It is totally unsatisfactory. Tonight is a classic example of a degree of arrogance in the way the Senate has determined, on the vote of the Democrats with the Labor Party, to keep members of the Public Service here for hours like this. It matches the arrogance the Senate shows to witnesses by having them attend Estimates committees at all sorts of ludicrous hours of the night and having them sit around for hours awaiting their call. Officers from this Department have been here tonight, for example, since 9 o'clock.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government, which has the support of the Democrats in determining this ludicrous behaviour, cannot determine to deal with its employees&mdash;many of them highly paid and highly skilled&mdash;in a better way, the Government should examine its own absolute incompetence in this matter. I suggest that it would be much more rational in the operation of Estimates committees to set specific appointment times for particular departments or agencies and, if the end of that appointment period&mdash;be it a two-hour period, for example&mdash;is reached without the matter having been finalised, then set another appointment date and time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That would be a reasonable procedure for those departmental officers who are resident in Canberra, rather than the sort of arrogance displayed by the Government here tonight in keeping these people here and the sort of arrogance displayed by the chairmen of Estimates committees in keeping public servants waiting until ludicrous hours of the night in Estimates committees, when a simple mechanical procedure involving set times for dealing with people&mdash;if the time is run over, then another appointment is set&mdash;seems such a simple thing to do. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Department was advised that attendance at the previous hearing would not be required on Tuesday 15 September, only at about 9.45 p.m. on that day. At that time my officers were informed that it had been decided the portfolio would not be examined.</PARA>
<PARA>That is okay, but the key point was that, as I understand it, the officers of the Department had only been given an indication that they may well not be called, not that they would not be called. I will read it exactly as it is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Earlier that day&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>said Mr Blunn&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a member of the Committee Secretariat had in conversation expressed the view that it was extremely unlikely that the portfolio would be reached, a suspicion we had previously reached, but could not of course commit the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>It just seems to be a ridiculous waste of money. It was evident earlier in the day that there would be no need. We just have to firm this sort of thing up. We have to be much more practical, coherent and rational&mdash;which, as I said, it is a bit hard to be at this hour of the morning&mdash;about the way we behave with our senior bureaucrats. If one had the choice of deciding how many hours a senior bureaucrat would be in active employment, one would not propose that it was a good idea to have him from 9 o'clock, for example, tonight until quarter past three this morning sitting outside, waiting on the Senate's pleasure. I find the whole thing absolutely abhorrent and I think we do not do ourselves any good by taking that approach. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, I am interested to see that out of the $60m-odd that the Australia Council gets, only something like $48.3m actually ends up going to arts organisations or arts people. For many of those organisations the creation of new funding mechanisms like creative fellowships has in effect meant&mdash;and perhaps the Minister could establish whether this is so or not&mdash;a reduction in the amount of grant money available to the traditional recipients of those grants. That is simply an eyeballing situation; it may well not be true, but that is what it seems from the break-up of these figures that I now have. I might leave it there at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I am advised that the fellowships were in fact new money and that this did not result in any reductions in grants. Briefly, in response to the earlier points made by Senator Baume, there is no senator in this chamber keener than I am to ensure a more efficient operation of Senate Estimates committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still recall with horror my first experience of them in the old Parliament House, with the rafts of public servants that Senator Baume referred to pacing the corridors in the early hours of the morning. I am going back six years now to what occurred in the old Parliament House. I can still recall my horror, at the very first Estimates committee I ever attended, that four officers from a small government department who had been waiting on our attendance since 2 o'clock in the afternoon finally appeared before the Estimates committee that I sat on for the very first time at 11 o'clock that night and were asked no questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply make that point to assert, as Senator Baume knows full well, that the difficulty of having bureaucrats, very senior and experienced officers, here in large numbers until all hours of the morning is not a unique thing that has happened as a result of any activity of this Government. It has been a feature of Estimates committees for as long as they have operated in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Baume would acknowledge that things are one hell of a lot better than they used to be. Senate officers do try very hard indeed to balance the convenience of witnesses against the legitimate requirement of senators to have them present because, again, I have been Minister at the table when this has happened. Senate officers cannot make firm statements like, `This will not be dealt with tonight'. They can only make guesstimates as to how things are going during the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Baume again knows, at times it is very difficult to predict, when things seem to be going very well, whether one will suddenly get someone with a particular interest in the subject that locks the thing up for two hours on one particular item. Indeed, the correspondence Senator Baume quoted from is correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The secretary of that Committee, an experienced Senate officer I must say, did his best to juggle those demands. But when people are sent home and told they are not required and we then move faster than we thought we might and he needs them, he then gets vociferous complaints from senators that the officers are not in attendance; and I have had both. So it is just a question of trying to balance the procedure. I conclude by saying that Senator Baume also knows full well the expeditious procedure of Senate committees is not something in the hands of the Government; it is a collective responsibility of all senators who are part of the process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. I simply remind him of the fact that the Government, with the Democrats, has a majority in making decisions about how things are done. The decisions that are made in some instances are damned silly. This is one of them. The way things are conducted at the moment is just simply unsustainable and unreasonable. Having us here at this hour of the morning is unsustainable and unreasonable. Using interstate officers as the flexible group who may or may not be reached on one night is absolutely absurd when there are local officers who could, in fact, much more reasonably occupy that short call position. It is just nonsense for the Minister to throw up his arms and say, `Look, I think it is terrible. I am terribly concerned but I have done nothing to fix it'. That is my concern, Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had asked whether the Secretary of the Department had yet had the opportunity to raise with the Department of Finance these guidelines and whether in fact any progress had been made on improving the quality of the figures that we are getting, particularly as I noted that in many instances it seemed that administrative expenses were being included in the program grants, which boosts the appearance of grants to organisations and diminishes the appearance of administrative costs. I must say I found that totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to see, when I got the actual figures from the Australia Council, that, for example, $800,000 was effectively the administrative cost of peer assessment, and that had previously been included in grants to arts organisations. In sports, there has been a significant moving around of program costs with the Australian Sports Commission. In that case the Commission was saying that the administrative costs were being overstated because of the requirements of the Finance Department. I hope that, whatever negotiations have taken place with the Department of Finance, we are going to get more coherent, rational and better informed documents, or documents that present the position much more accurately than they have in the past, using clear criteria about what is administrative cost and what is not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the Senate Estimates Committee I failed to deal effectively, because I did not know what the facts were, with the national performing arts touring program. This matter concerns me a little. There had been many rumours and even scuttlebutt around the place that this proposed national arts tour program was going to end up under the chairmanship of Mr Simon Dawkins, as indeed it did. The point made strongly to me by some arts organisations was that a separate bureaucracy appears now to be in the process of being established under this new chairmanship of Mr Dawkins, who I understand provided the basic input to the report from the Australian Performing Arts Centres Association, which had provided the strongest pressure for creating this organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been put to me&mdash;I would like the Minister to assist me on this&mdash;that the split-up of the $2m in funds in the current financial year is to be $1m to the Arts Council of Australia and APACA; $500,000 split between the Opera, the Australian Chamber Orchestra and the Australian Ballet; and $500,000 on new or other work. The program is administered by the committee set up by the Minister but run by DASET, specifically the arts branch. I wondered to what extent the creation of this committee would involve a set of expenses; what those expenses would be; whether there would be any additional bureaucracy apart from the expenses of having the committee involved; and to what extent it would diminish the amount of money available for distribution to the arts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, is this a way of providing additional funding to APACA and the Arts Council of Australia so that it, rather than the Department itself, will then have greater powers of determining the touring? For example, is there any way to ensure that this money will go entirely to touring and not to assisting any proposal to build a $12m headquarters in Barton called Arts House? No matter what the merits of it are, and I am not going to enter into those now, I want to make certain there will be no administrative costs being creamed off the $1m which I am told is to go to the Arts Council of Australia and APACA. </PARA>

In the printed response to my question about whether or not Australia Council funds were involved in Arts Action's project for printing 20,000 postcards for delivery to Parliament House, the reply was that Arts Action uses some of the funds provided to it by the Australia Council for the National Arts Week national promotional campaign. I wonder whether the Government is content with the use of arts money in that way and whether it intends to provide funding for that kind of purpose. I understand that Arts Action's funding has been reduced, in the sense that it is no longer going to be running the particular program called Arts Week. I wonder whether any of the funding that is going to Arts Action this year&mdash;I understand there is going to be some funding&mdash;will be used for that kind of purpose and whether the Government is content that it should be.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am also advised that, as I am sure Senator Baume knows, this organisation is funded and controlled by the Australia Council, which is at arm's length from the Government. Frankly, I think Senator Baume would be far more aware of its activities than I am. I had a discussion about the organisation this morning and, for the first time, found out what it did. I know that it does involve a number of prominent Australians, whose names were mentioned to me this morning, who are actively engaged in the role of promoting the arts in Australia in a positive advocacy sense or lobbying sense, and that it does an effective job of that. I presume that the postcards delivered to Parliament House were advocating the cause of the arts to politicians. I assume that is the case. The fundamental point I am making is that this is an agency that is controlled by the Australia Council, which monitors and takes care of its operations.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Australia Day Council has been going through a period of some disarray. The Government has taken an extraordinarily long time to replace its Chairman. Last week or the week before, Mr Phillip Adams was appointed Chairman of the National Australia Day Council. A new Council has also been appointed, including Merv Nixon, who used to run the South Coast Labor Council in Wollongong and with whom I have had many a stoush in the past. I have no comment on the merits or otherwise of Mr Nixon or on whether or not he is a supporter of the concept of Australia Day, but I am very concerned to see&mdash;as I understand it&mdash;that not one of the chairpersons of the State Australia Day councils is represented on the National Australia Day Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year we had a total breakdown of communications  between the State organisations&mdash;which actually do the work and try to make Australia Day worth while in each State&mdash;and the Federal organisation, involving a series of particularly unpleasant letters from the national body to at least one of the State bodies. If there is any need for reconciliation, it is in this area. The National Australia Day Council has the job of selecting the Australian of the Year, the Young Australian of the Year and the Australian Achiever Awards for Australia Day over the next two years. I am not overwhelmed with the composition of this Council. There may be some very good people in it, but I had hoped that these appointments would have been aimed at trying to resolve what has been a difficult problem. I have been concerned about the nature of correspondence that has been sent to the ACT from the Australia Day Council. I wonder what the policy is. Is it not to have State chairmen on it, or are there some State chairmen on this Council?</PARA>

I am further advised that two other State chairs were offered places on the Council but declined them, so potentially four chairs were offered positions. Two accepted and two did not. But I am further advised&mdash;and I think Senator Baume would probably agree with this&mdash;that a deliberate decision was taken that the national body would simply not be a compilation or reflection of the State bodies, but would have some new blood. I have personally spoken to Phillip Adams about his role in this body and I commend the amount of effort that he is putting into it. He is personally committed to the job. He has a reputation for giving 100 per cent to everything he does. He must have been chairman of almost everything in Australia by now.

There is concern on this side of the chamber about the Government's attitude to the Australia Day Council and to the concept of Australia Day. There seems to be a growing preparedness to treat Australia Day as some kind of embarrassment about which we should feel some guilt because the colonisation of this nation resulted in the dispossession of the land from the Aboriginal people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not one of those of the view that that should diminish our preparedness to celebrate our national day and our proudness of that national day as citizens of Australia. I got very little comfort from the fact that the Australian Government took so lightly the membership and chairmanship of the National Australia Day Council and that that position remained vacant from February until this appointment was made just the other day in November. It does not seem to suggest that the Government takes this organisation or, in fact, Australia Day, very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am under the impression that at least one of the people who chose not to take up an offer of membership was concerned about what I am certain he felt to be the lack of commitment by the Government to the concept of Australia Day. Looking at the members of the Council, I do not know the extent of their commitment to and strength of support for celebrating Australia Day as I would hope that we as Australians would. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the remarks of my colleague Senator Baume. I must confess to the Minister for Transport and Communications that I was a little surprised at the appointment of Phillip Adams. There are aspects of Phillip Adams's work which I admire and enjoy. But I think I am right in saying, and correct me if I am wrong, that the chairmanship of Australia Day generally involves people who are comfortable with our national symbols, our history and the institutions of this country. I would like to feel that this Committee will not be in any way down-playing national symbols and the institutions which have brought Australia to where it is today.

I would like the Minister to give us an assurance, but I do not know whether he is in a position to do that. I am not quite sure what the relationship of the Government is to the National Australia Day Council. I would like to hear a very clear statement from the Minister indicating that he would expect the Committee to show the great enthusiasm that the vast majority of Australians have for their national symbols and to perhaps quell any fears that some might have that this may well be yet another attempt by the Government to bring in a new agenda. </PARA>

As this program is done entirely out of the Minister's office rather than through the Institute of Sport or, as I understand it, through the Department&mdash;and it is certainly not done through the national sporting bodies&mdash;I wonder whether the Minister gets advice from any other departments relating to the non-sporting element of this program.</PARA></TALK.START>

The amount of money is quite small, around $2.5m, and for administrative convenience or efficiency it was decided, because it is such a small amount of the total that is spent, to retain it within this general facility rather than set up a separate structure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My advice is that is not the case. From my own personal knowledge of where some of this money has been spent, I do not think that these would necessarily be the most appropriate bodies to provide particularly useful advice about the expenditure of these relatively small sums spread out across Australia. I have certainly made routine personal representations, as I think most members of parliament have, for certain things. Particularly in the Northern Territory with our very bad incidence of skin cancers, I know that shades are often sought after for swimming pools and so on.

The reply indicates that 22.2 per cent of Sports Commission funding is allocated indirectly to sport and the balance of funding&mdash;8 per cent&mdash;is allocated to the administration of Commission programs and so on.

Martin Vinnicombe, for example, has already cost the Australian Sports Drug Agency about $73,000 in legal expenses. Provision is made, on current estimates, for another $240,000. That should be going to decent sports people, rather than to fight legal action against a self-confessed drug cheat. If the paralympic people, the disabled sports people, could get $240,000 they would be very happy indeed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, this evening we have seen a series of totally unnecessary quorum calls and equally unnecessary and even more time wasting divisions. As I have said on a number of occasions, and Opposition senators knew perfectly well that I was telling the truth, we were making good progress until we were forced by the Opposition to report progress. What we have seen tonight, in the face of this sanctimonious humbug from the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill), is tedious repetition. We are having interesting philosophical discussions about the observance of Australia Day at twenty minutes to five in the morning. It is very interesting stuff. It is hardly relative to Senate Estimates committees, but much of the debate never is relevant to Senate Estimates committees. </PARA>

The Government intends to process those Bills. To answer Senator Hill's question about where we are going and where we are at, I am advised by the Manager of Government Business that we intend to proceed with the Estimates proceedings today until we finish. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter is far more serious than Senator Collins has led us to believe. I am constrained to stand as I did on 5 May this year when I observed for the first time the bizarre behaviour that occurs in this chamber. On that occasion we sat until 3.40 a.m., and then we went until midnight that night. We saw the behaviour that occurred on that occasion. What concerns me most is not the behaviour of senators, because I think that some of their behaviour is not worthy of comment. I refer to the annual report of the Department of the Senate. This has occurred primarily in the last two years. The report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the great majority of cases, the system of checks is such that most errors in schedules of amendments or third reading prints are detected in the course of their preparation and printing. The pressure of frequent sittings past midnight in May and June 1992 took their toll at the end of the autumn sittings, however, when an incorrect schedule of amendments to the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992 was transmitted to the House of Representatives and circulated in the House when it agreed to the amendments made by the Senate. A consequence of the error was that the legislation was not assented to in time for the proposed starting date of 1 July 1992 for the new superannuation scheme. Remedial action will be taken at the beginning of the 1992 budget sittings including additional procedures to prevent recurrence of errors . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is just one point. I refer also to late sittings, which are mentioned in the annual report of the Department of the Senate. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The occupational health and safety implications for staff working long hours caused by the Senate sitting late into the night are being monitored. In the past financial year the Senate continued to sit after 11 pm on 33 of the 78 sitting days, including 17 days where the Senate sat beyond midnight. This represents a total of 42 per cent of sitting days where staff were required to work beyond 11 pm. These staff generally begin work at 8.30 am each day. In 1990-91 the Senate sat after 11 pm on 40 days out of 83, including 19 after midnight (that is, on 48 per cent of sitting days). Comparative data for the last two parliaments, that is, from 1987 to June 1992, are included at Figure 1 in the Table Office. Some officers regularly work more than 12 hours on sitting days and, on late sitting nights, particularly at the end of a period of sittings, can work for 15 hours or more, as work is required to be completed in preparation for the next sitting after the Senate adjourns.</PARA>
<PARA>I spoke about that in May. The effect was remarkable. I had staff coming to my office from all over Parliament House, not only from the Senate side but also from the other side, telling me about stress breakdown and work practices that led to that occurring. I received a letter from Dr Tony Adams, the Chief Medical Adviser, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am becoming increasingly concerned about the amount of stress being placed on politicians, their staff and portfolio public servants and the subsequent health effects as the direct result of daily work habits and practices.</PARA>
<PARA>This reflects on all of us, Mr Chairman. I was outside and I saw senior public servants asleep in their chairs at 5 a.m., having worked all day, and we expect there to be no carryover of this. I know there was a full moon a couple of days ago, but that is no excuse; and it is Friday the 13th today. It is reflected in the behaviour of people such as Senator Evans, who said, `I will quietly, deliberately, walk across the chamber and garrotte her'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was the same day when the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, was appealing for adults-only behaviour, violent behaviour, to put on after 9.30 p.m.; and that occurred at 5.30 in the afternoon. Not only does this lead to behavioural disorders related to stress, it can lead to insanity. I predict that it will lead to death&mdash;if not of politicians, of their staff&mdash;if this sort of behaviour is allowed to continue. I make that statement confidently in the light of what I have seen in the two years that I have been here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always these sorts of debates that bring out the most unctuousness in the Opposition. For any realistic assessment of the process we have been going through in the Committee of the Whole, no objective observer could say that this chamber is meeting the precepts of the reform brought in two years ago. When I was Manager of Government Business we set up a committee, I think under your chairmanship, Mr Chairman, to try to put a bit of rationality into the procedures of the Senate. At the time there were all sorts of checks and balances put in. One of the great concessions of the Government was to say, `Yes, we do agree to setting up a reference of Bills to committees for greater scrutiny'. That was, I have always thought, of greater advantage, on balance, to Opposition scrutiny than it was to the Government's interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But one of the trade-offs for all this was that we put some rationality, some decency and some structure into the Committee of the Whole. If there is one process in this Senate that has been disgracefully abused by both sides of this chamber over the years, whether in opposition or government, it is the Committee of the Whole. The reason initially was that any senator could contribute any amount of debate on any number of occasions, which gave him an absolute infinite potential to create mischief, if so minded. That was the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Chairman, your committee said that an Estimates committee would have matters debated here in the Committee of the Whole only if they were reported in the Committee report or by way of reservation. For how long did the decency of that deal last with those changes brought in? With the very first Committee of the Whole, hundreds of reservations were put in or there was total generality of reservation, giving the opportunity that we have witnessed in the last three days for any matter to be gone over repetitiously time and time again and for wasting the time of this Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not allege that we have had a filibuster here, but what we have had is a total lack of discipline and a complete abrogation of what this chamber agreed to do two years ago. One of the more sensible suggestions I think we could make at this time of morning is for the Manager and the Whips to sit down and say, `If it is the Opposition or anyone else who is mindful to shoot through, what sort of guarantees do we have that you are not going to spend another two weeks on the Committee of the Whole? If you are not willing to do that, then we will bat on. If you are willing to do that maybe some rationality can prevail'. </PARA>

I reject that word, on behalf of my colleagues. It has no truth whatsoever; there is no conspiracy. What we have in front of us is an example of what happens when we allow anybody in this chamber to make up, on the run, words to fill in spaces while there is a struggle going on to find something relevant to say.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will continue to enter into international agreements to ensure a degree of parity. We are also anxious to ensure that the very high standards that Senator Crichton-Browne has rightly referred to are adopted by other countries. But if I can take the question to its logical conclusion, I certainly do not think Senator Crichton-Browne, knowing the public stance that he has taken on this issue&mdash;I served with him on the committee that investigated this&mdash;would be suggesting that we should relax our strict regime on drugs or drug testing and put ourselves on parity with countries that do in fact have lax regimes and provide the opportunity for people to use performance enhancing drugs, some of which I could probably do with myself as I speak. I am sure that Senator Crichton-Browne would like us to place the proper emphasis on this, which is to maintain the very strict standards we have in Australia and at the same time continue to negotiate and work with countries around the world to adopt similar standards, which is what we are doing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that we have some bilateral arrangements. I think Canada is one; I think we also have a bilateral arrangement with the UK. My question is: what dent is the rest of the world making on those nations which matter&mdash;to wit, China, Germany and Japan? I do not want to be seen as hopping up and down and asking one-off questions. My understanding is that&mdash;forgive me for not knowing the description&mdash;the athletics federation in America, for instance, has been thoroughly uncooperative in coming to a bilateral, trilateral or unilateral relationship. Quite frankly, it is almost tragic to have athletes from America running as they did in the sprints at the last Olympics, gassed to the eyeballs with anabolic steroids or clenbuterol&mdash;and one might want to suggest that that is not a steroid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give an example. As I recall, the young Australian Darren Clark was placed fourth in the 400 metres at the Olympic Games before last in Seoul. Every athlete ahead of him has since tested positive. So it might well be that he would have been a gold medallist and not fourth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same way, that brilliant young Australian cyclist who got a silver medal at the recent Olympics Games would not have even been going if that cheat had not been picked up. He would not have been there if it had not been for a regime of Australian testing. Given that Australia has socialised sport, what are we doing to ensure, as best as is possible, that our athletes are competing on some sort of reasonable playing field?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course he can. Anybody can stand in the committee stage of the debate and get the call. Senator Coulter, one of the agencies which will receive funds through the Appropriation Bills is the Australian Sports Drug Agency. Certain questions were asked about that and reservations were made. It is sometimes quite difficult for the Chair to determine whether or not a question is relevant. But it has not happened only in this particular case; it has been going on for I do not know how many hours now in the debate on Estimates committees A, B and C. I should imagine that it will go on in the debate on Estimates committees D, E and F. I should not speak from the Chair for too long, but Senator Robert Ray raised a short time ago the fact that the reservations are not specific enough for the Chair to be able to determine whether a question is relevant. Under those conditions, I have to allow the question to proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wonder whether Senator Bishop could stop her persistent interjections so that I can provide Senator Crichton-Browne with the information that he is seeking. It might help to save some time. Senator Crichton-Browne wished to know the countries with which we have bilateral agreements. Those three countries are Canada, the United Kingdom and Norway. I know the problem that Senator Crichton-Browne went on to describe is a very real one. But, by definition and logic, the only way that one could address that&mdash;and I know that Senator Crichton-Browne is not advocating this&mdash;would be to relax our own drug regulation to the point where it is as lax as perhaps it is in some other countries, thereby giving the same, if you like, unfair competitive advantage to our athletes. We are not prepared to do that. I think it is true to say that there is widespread support in the Australian sporting community&mdash;at least that is what I have picked up&mdash;for the stringent restrictions that we currently have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is also fair to say that there is growing international support for a drug free sport environment. We will continue to maintain the same strict standards as we currently do; we will try to extend the bilateral agreements that we have beyond the three countries with which we currently have them; and we will continue to lobby where we can in all of the world bodies for the same stringent drug testing process that we have in Australia to be applied worldwide. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Coulter asked a good question. He asked me whether I am arguing for more or whether I am arguing for less. I am simply arguing for the truth. I am arguing, if we are going to use argumentative terms, for the facts. I am sure that Senator Coulter does not mean to be absolutely impertinent by suggesting it is obscene for me to be asking how the funds are being spent. To the extent that we spend that sort of money&mdash;for instance, the Australian Sports Commission's estimate for 1992-93 is $59m&mdash;it is not unreasonable to ask whether those funds are being spent appropriately.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am asking: to the extent that we now have socialised sport in Australia, what steps is the Government taking to ensure that other nations are complying in the way we are? For instance, has it thought about using UNESCO as a forum for raising this question? My understanding is that it is not irrelevant for a forum such as UNESCO to be considered in this respect. We can all piously stand here&mdash;this applies to me more than to anybody else&mdash;and say that we have cleaned up drugs in sport in Australia, but the ultimate question is: what are we doing to ensure that our athletes are not disadvantaged by the regime that we have put in place? To the extent that we have put it in place&mdash;and I do not need to make the obvious observation that we all support it&mdash;what are we doing?

I want to give one piece of information, and that is to add New Zealand to the list of countries. There are, in fact, four countries with which Australia has bilateral agreements&mdash;Canada, the United Kingdom, Norway and New Zealand. The Government has under consideration using our good offices in organisations such as UNESCO to advance this matter, but Senator Crichton-Browne knows as well as any other senator in this chamber the very difficult problems that arise in terms of the various attitudes exhibited to drug testing by some fiercely competitive countries around the world. I state the obvious by saying that there is and always will be, of necessity, a limit to the amount of influence that a country such as Australia can have if a country with which we are competing insists on not applying strict drug standards or treats them with a wink and a nod, as some countries obviously do.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to contingent notice of motion, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Hill) moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely, a motion to give precedence to a motion for Question Time to be held immediately.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I move this motion in order to give precedence to a motion to provide for Question Time to be held forthwith. Why are we back here today? We are here because at 6 o'clock on Friday morning, when the Government had failed to push through its Appropriations, despite sitting the whole of the night, it decided that it needed to come back here the following Monday morning, notwithstanding the fact that earlier that day the Senate had agreed to sit another week, which meant that the Senate would be sitting four weeks in a row between now and Christmas. It was not necessary for the Government to get its Appropriation Bills through on Thursday, nor is it necessary for it to get them through today. It has time to consider these Bills after the Senate comes back, according to the timetable that had been agreed to earlier on that last sitting day; that is, Thursday and the early hours of Friday morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only logical reason for the Government to have called the Senate back today is that it wanted to preserve the option of a December election to the last possible moment. Now it seems that that has been abandoned. So why has the Senate been called back today? It is certainly not to deal with the Appropriations because, as I have said, there is still plenty of time to deal with the Appropriations. Therefore, if we are here, we should carry out the functions which are normally assigned to us. One of those functions, as far as an Opposition is concerned, is to question Ministers on the conduct of their Departments and their portfolios. In the normal way&mdash;the normal responsibility of accountability that an opposition therefore has&mdash;we are moving to suspend the Standing Orders in order that we have the opportunity to question Ministers. We are going to have a problem because it seems that half the Ministers are not even here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presumably, the Australian Democrats will support this motion. Senator Robert Ray, who I understand is the Acting Leader today, as the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) and the Deputy Leader (Senator Gareth Evans) are overseas, will get up and tell us what the ministerial arrangements are for today. We want the right to ask questions. We ought to have the right to ask questions when there are a million Australians out of work, when we understand that about 20 per cent of Australians are either unemployed or underemployed, when we look at Labor's heartland and we see that youth unemployment is in excess of 50 per cent and when we look at my State and see that unemployment is over 11.6 per cent. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What do we want to do about it? We have put down an alternative program to provide jobs, which is more than the Government has done. What the Government has said to the Australian people so far is more of the same. What Mr Keating is offering Australia so far is nothing more than the program that it has at the moment, which has produced the recession and the growing unemployment that has flowed from it to the tragic levels that exist now, the highest they have been since the 1930s. That is the Government's alternative. It has nothing new to offer Australia at all, except a Prime Minister who is interested in only one job&mdash;that is, his own&mdash;and a Prime Minister who will try every trick in the book rather than debate policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had the courage to put the policies down on the table&mdash;policies that will reduce taxation to provide some incentive in this country; policies that will free up industrial relations because the Government has the most rigid industrial relations system in the world; and policies that will improve infrastructure and give businesses a chance and an opportunity to expand and provide jobs. Fightback is all about providing jobs and the Government offers no hope for Australia in relation to jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion for a Question Time will also be a test of the Australian Democrats. The Australian Democrats say that they are here to keep the bastards honest. In recent times their only interest seems to have been to attack us also. Who did the deal to sit through Thursday night so there would not be a proper debate on the Appropriations? It was the Australian Democrats. Was there any consultation? No. At 6 o'clock in the morning who did the deal with the Government to come back here the following week to get the Appropriations out of the way? It was the Democrats. Who does not attend Estimates committees? The Democrats. Who is not interested in the Appropriation debates in this place? The Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us see whether the Democrats are prepared to join with us today to at least give us the opportunity to call Ministers to account for their administration. This motion will give them the opportunity to vote with us for a Question Time to put Ministers back on the map where they should be. Or will we see the Democrats again over there with the Labor Party&mdash;as the fourth faction of the Labor Party, which is the way they seem to have behaved in recent times?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have moved the suspension of Standing Orders because it is vitally important that the Senate has the opportunity today to question Ministers on the failures of their administration and the terrible state in which we now find Australia, the worst position that it has been in for 60 years. If ever there were a time that this Senate should be questioning Ministers, it is now. That is the reason I have moved this motion of suspension. </PARA>

We are here this week to do the Appropriations and to make sure that, whatever it takes, we pass those Appropriations.

That is the reality; that is why we are here. It is the fault of those opposite, and they know it. Senator Short has been putting out all sorts of silly press releases trying to whip up a crisis that, fortunately, everybody laughed at, as it deserved.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perfectly true, as I have said repeatedly, that the Opposition is to be praised for putting down its program, Fightback, well before the election. The Opposition deserves praise for this. It was very courageous and very correct of the Opposition to do that. But now, as Senator McMullan said, clearly the polls are not in the Opposition's favour. If the Opposition wants to charge that the Government wants the opportunity for an election now, the charge that the Opposition does not want an election now can equally be laid on its side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process should be the fair and proper consideration of the Appropriations. Thirty hours of debate on Appropriations is a totally reasonable amount of time. Yet we are still here, still with a great deal of potential filibustering to go on. Surely, having come back to an adjourned debate&mdash;and I stress that point because it is relevant to the criticism that was made of you, Mr President, in relation to prayers&mdash;specifically to deal with Appropriations, it is totally inappropriate for the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Hill) to attempt to filibuster still further by demanding Question Time when this is a day we would not normally have had in any case.

But watch those opposite slime up to the Democrats when they want them to support an amendment or when they do not want them to support some piece of legislation. All the abuse disappears. Butter would not melt in their mouths when they are approaching the Democrats to get their results. But as soon as the Democrats stand up on something and say, `No, no.

In rulings that I gave on 3 and 5 December 1991, I pointed out that by means of contingent notices of motion which have been used in recent years, the business of the Senate could be completely disrupted by a continuous series of motions to suspend Standing Orders. I then ruled that a contingent notice of motion to suspend Standing Orders could be employed only once on any occasion. Those rulings were partly based on the fact that the Senate had agreed to a limitation of time for debate on a Bill and that there was an obligation on the Chair to ensure that that determination of the Senate was not subverted.</PARA></TALK.START>

As I recall it, on that occasion I indicated that it would be somewhat incongruous, perhaps bordering on the unfair, for those of us, other than the Leader of the Opposition and Opposition senators, who have contingent notices of motion if the Leader of the Opposition, by moving a motion pursuant to his contingent motion, were to deny me the right to move a motion pursuant to my contingent notice of motion&mdash;which may be, now or later, for example, a motion to condemn the Opposition or whoever. For the Leader of the Opposition to move a motion subject to his contingency motion and deny me the opportunity of moving a motion contingent on my notice of motion which is contrary to the Opposition, I suggest is a bit ludicrous.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Mr President, there are two points I wish to make in relation to your ruling, both of which would lead me to seek you to reconsider your ruling as to whether Senator Hill or another senator can today move a second contingent notice of motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first point follows from what Senator Hill said, and in fact endorses what he said. When you last ruled that Senator Hill or another senator was not able to move a second contingent notice of motion on the same sitting day, Senator Hill correctly reminded you that that was when the Senate was under a guillotine. The rationale for that ruling was that Standing Orders would otherwise be used simply to defeat a specific motion of the Senate, and we would therefore be in some sort of non sequitur: deciding one thing and then, by using the Standing Orders, totally defeating what we had just decided. That would make the Senate look as if it did not know from one minute to the next what it wanted to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put to you, Mr President, that that is not the situation now. If Senator Hill or someone else were allowed at this moment to move a second contingent notice of motion&mdash;second for Monday, not second for this sitting day; after all, one was moved on Thursday&mdash;it would not defeat any specific motion of the Senate. The motion on the Friday morning of the late Thursday sitting was that the sitting of the Senate suspend. It was not a substantive motion dealing with what the Senate then ought to do. We are in the process now of deciding what the Senate ought to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put to you, Mr President, that you should allow sufficient motions for the Senate to decide what it wants to do, because all it decided on Thursday night&mdash;or Friday morning; call it what you will&mdash;was that it would suspend. That motion does not dictate what should happen today. It might have been in everybody's minds that we would come back and go on with the Estimates, but it was not contained in the motion. The motion was simply that we would suspend and then come back and go on as though we were continuing with a normal sitting day. An additional contingent notice of motion in no way defeats that motion that was passed at 6.15 on Friday morning. Therefore, I put it to you that it is a completely different situation from that of contingent notices of motion being moved when the Senate is under a guillotine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My second point is that, as I understand it&mdash;you may be able to help me here, Mr President&mdash;there was a contingent notice of motion moved on Thursday. In that case, what are you doing telling me and other senators here on one occasion that it is not acceptable to move two contingent notices of motion on one sitting day when you have just allowed a second one to be moved? Did you think one thing when we came in here at 2 o'clock and another now that it is 10 to three?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What rationale is there for allowing Senator Hill to move the first one today? Mr President, you cannot say to me, `But it is a different day', because we have just been told by Senator McMullan that, as far as the Senate is concerned, it is the same day. If you want it to be the same sitting day&mdash;and you have allowed one contingent notice of motion&mdash;you might like to explain, Mr President, why you allowed one contingent notice of motion, came in here, allowed another one, and then said in the next breath, `You can't have two on one sitting day'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, we are not interested in filibustering. What Senator Ray said in the earlier debate was quite untrue. If Government members go back and check the hours of debate, they will probably find that to get to this stage of Estimates in the committee stage in the chamber has taken less time in this instance than in the past. The Government's answer to that would be that we have filibustered in the past. That is not a satisfactory explanation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee stage of the Appropriations debate is one of the principal opportunities that we have to question Ministers on their administration and, with the state of the nation as it is at the moment, we should have that opportunity and play out our role fully. It is our responsibility to do our job. If Government members want to call it a filibuster, that is up to them, but the facts do not support them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings us up to today. What did we want to do today? We believe that the Government's attempt to avoid accepting the normal functions of Ministers today was a disgrace. The Government should have come in here and been prepared to accept a Question Time, as always happens except, as Senator Harradine says, in exceptional circumstances such as the Gulf war. Such is not the case today. It is basically a normal continuing day of debate, and Ministers should have been prepared to cop Question Time. The  Government  was not  prepared  to  do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, if it is to be a normal day, we would have the responsibility to put down an urgency motion or a matter of public importance&mdash;and that is what we would have done. The way the Government and the Democrats did their deal at 6.30 on Friday morning was such that we do not have the opportunity to put down an MPI or urgency motion today and therefore seek the opportunity to debate the economy, which one would have thought was only reasonable in the circumstances with one million Australians out of work. We have no other option but to seek the suspension of standing orders in order that that might be debated. That is what we have sought to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has simply carried out the function today that the Australian people would expect of an opposition: to come in here, demand the right to question Ministers as to the failure of their administration and seek to debate the most important issue facing this nation at the moment&mdash;the appalling state of one million Australians out of work. That is why I am seeking to suspend Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the situation now is that the Government is agreeing&mdash;I have to come back and ask you, Mr President, whether your ruling will stand, but that might be dealt with later&mdash;that I should have the right to seek that suspension, although presumably the Democrats are not prepared to debate the economy in the same way as they are not prepared to ask Ministers questions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Hill) moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely, a motion to give precedence to a motion to condemn the Government for the high level of unemployment, as reflected in the figures released on 12 November 1992, which has resulted from the continuing failure of the Government's economic policies.</PARA>
<PARA>I am seeking suspension of Standing Orders in order that the Senate can debate the major issue facing this country. The motion that I wish to be debated condemns the Government for the massive and tragically high level of unemployment as reflected by last Thursday's figures, which revealed that nearly one million Australians do not have a job as a result of the continuing failure of the Government's economic policies. As I said, it is the No. 1 issue in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whenever the issue of unemployment is raised, the Ministers walk out; those who bothered to turn up for today's sitting walk out. Senator Ray, who was apparently on the record last week as referring to his leader, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), as a clown, gets up and walks out. Senator Cook, who is responsible for industrial relations in this country and who in turn has played a significant part in this terrible unemployment picture that we face, gets up and walks out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government is not prepared to face up to the responsibility it should bear that one million unemployed are basically unemployed as a result of the failure of its policies. We should never forget that this Prime Minister, Mr Keating, said that this is the recession that we had to have. This is his recession that he deliberately brought on with his high interest rate policies because he wanted to dampen demand in order to try to solve the balance of payments problems. He pushed up interest rates to a level that meant that not only poor business but also good business went bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Day after day we came back into this chamber and said, `The rates of interest you have in this country at the moment are destroying business, particularly small business. They are going bankrupt by the dozens'. The Minister for Industrial Relations and the Prime Minister, the then Treasurer, said, `No, we know better'. Mr Keating always knows better. Mr Keating has to cop the responsibility for this because, as I said, there is no one person in Australia more responsible for the terrible plight of one million unemployed and another one million underemployed than the Prime Minister; and he has to cop the penalty when we get to this next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why I particularly wanted this matter debated today was to address the question as to what happened to the magic One Nation statement. One Nation was going to be the Government's answer. What did Mr Keating claim would be achieved from One Nation? How many jobs were going to be achieved from One Nation? When he put down the One Nation statement he said, `Labor's plan for the next four years will create over 800,000 jobs'. What has happened to the jobs? He said there would be major infrastructure development that would provide a new competitive edge to Australia. What has happened to the infrastructure development, the railways and the roads? They have not gone ahead because the Government could not do a deal with its unions. The Government&mdash;this political arm of the trade union movement&mdash;was unable to do a deal with the unions to enable these infrastructure projects to go ahead and thus produce jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industrial Relations should stand condemned more than any other Minister for that. He comes in and talks to us about this social contract that he has with the labour movement, the ACTU, but when it comes to sitting down and doing a deal with the labour movement so that we can get infrastructure in this country up to scratch in order that business can be competitive, in order for it to grow and employ he cannot do it, he cannot deliver. This is the type of industrial relations situation in Australia that he applauds. This is what he said Australia needs. He says that this is a special relationship that only the Labor Party has with the union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it gets thrown out by the people and it cannot cop the industrial relations reforms that are brought in, what does this Minister and his Prime Minister do? They endorse mass industrial action such as occurred in Victoria last week. Victoria is a cop case. One quarter of a million Victorians are out of work. What Victoria needs more than anything else is to get people back to work. What do this Minister and his Prime Minister do? They endorse massive industrial action and a State-wide strike. They are now going to lead the country into a series of rolling national strikes just because they cannot accept the democratic will of the Victorian people. The Victorian people threw out the Kirner Government because it failed in proportion almost beyond precedent. The Kennett Government has come in and implemented change. Instead of this Prime Minister getting up and saying, `We need jobs and the last thing that would create jobs is mass industrial action', he and his Minister endorse it. </PARA>

I now rise because Senator Cook has now defined `government' as the Kennett Government lying; by definition, he has isolated it to personalities. I am not unmindful of your previous ruling in the context that a government is very often described and considered as something larger than Cabinet, but to refer to `government' as the Kennett Government is referring to the Ministry.

We think that some 20,000 new jobs can be achieved almost immediately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the One Nation statement, and now in the Treasurer's statement, we have stimulated the economy by investing in public infrastructure development and encouraging employers in the private sector to take on more employees.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what does the Opposition propose on that? The Opposition proposes a consumption tax package which does not stimulate the economy. In fact, it has the effect of taking $7 billion out of the economy. The Opposition has proposed, for those people who are unemployed, to kick them off the dole after nine months as if the problem of unemployment is their fault and not something that the wider community should be concerned about. The Opposition has proposed the abolition of a number of skills training programs which were established so that unemployed people could be retrained and re-skilled to take jobs in the emergent economy as the recovery comes through. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we see the very strong support that Mr Keating and Senator Cook have given to Mr Halfpenny, I have to say that there is much merit in the comment made by my colleague Senator Bishop. A number of fascinating comments have been made in the course of the debate. We had the comment that was made earlier today by Senator Ray that Question Time was a courtesy and that, if we behaved ourselves, he may consider at some later date that we should have a Question Time. What an absolute outrage. And for the Democrats to support that&mdash;the party that is meant to come in here to make sure that parliaments and governments are accountable&mdash;is an absolute outrage. Then we had the other astonishing statement made by Senator Lees that, `Our job is to let the Government get its legislation through'. That is not the job of a parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is petrified about the ventilation of the level of corruption, which is well known and well documented, at the various Olympic Games&mdash;in which senior officials of the IOC executive personally involve themselves; and on many other occasions when they are not personally involved they conspire to cover it up. This is not ventilated in a proper and appropriate way in the community in Australia and, more particularly, it is not taken up in the appropriate international forums for fear that in some way it may inhibit our prospects of winning the bid for the year 2000 Games in Sydney. In my view, that is what is at the heart of the problem&mdash;that is, because of continuing vested interests, there is no legitimate, proper or genuine attempt to ensure that drug taking is removed and eliminated from international competition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I want to add is that we have in Australia a body called the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories. That body has accreditation by the International Olympic Committee. It is the only Southern Hemisphere organisation that has such accreditation. It is a body that is internationally respected and very widely respected. It is a body that has been transformed over recent years, and that has been done in such a way that in the last 12 to 15 months it has received that international accreditation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One reason why that body has that accreditation, one reason why that body is recognised internationally, and one important factor in Sydney getting past stage one in terms of its Olympics bid, would be the presence in Australia of such a body working viably and effectively.

It has other functions as well, and we can go into those through other portfolios, but we are talking about drugs in sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are committed to maintaining that body in government hands. What we on this side of the Parliament are concerned about, especially when it comes to the question of testing for drugs in sport and the necessity for a body in Australia to be internationally recognised, is that in the Fightback package&mdash;at about page 220 or so&mdash;there is a provision to sell off, to commercialise, to privatise AGAL. We think that is a step that would undermine quite enormously our capacity not only to determine where the drugs are used in sport but also to have our mechanisms within Australia internationally recognised. I think it is fair to say that the international recognition has depended on a body proving itself, and we as a government are quite determined to ensure that this body is not privatised, as the Opposition wants to do, and is not commercialised to any greater extent, as the Opposition would like, so that we do not jeopardise not only our athletes and their competitiveness but also the Sydney bid for the Olympics in the year 2000. </PARA>

As such, it gives us respectability and it gives us reliability. That means that any bid that we would want to pursue through Sydney would be enhanced. That is the positive part.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the week following the announcement of record unemployment in Australia of 11.3 per cent and after witnessing the debacle this afternoon of the Government's complete and utter mismanagement of the business of this House, it is probably appropriate and interesting to revisit another example of the Government's appalling mismanagement of an issue which led to high unemployment and a record number of bankruptcies in an area of Far North Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee will be aware of the drama surrounding the World Heritage listing of the wet tropics rainforests several years ago and the establishment of the Wet Tropics Management Authority that resulted from that decision of the Government. Whilst no-one these days is opposed&mdash;or ever was opposed&mdash;to saving the wet tropics rainforests there was a great deal of debate about the way the listing of the rainforests was managed, the way the boundaries were drawn and the way all things surrounding that action of this Government occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wet Tropics Management Authority was set up to oversee the rainforests. That authority came into being at a time when, in the areas of Far North Queensland where the Wet Tropics Management Authority operates, there was a great deal of disquiet; a great many people had been very badly hurt; a number of timber mills had closed; a great number of people had been thrown on the unemployment scrap heap; a number of businesses had gone bankrupt; and a great deal of fence mending needed to be done. Unfortunately, the way the Government, in conjunction with the Queensland Government, entered into the operation of the Wet Tropics Management Authority was the wrong way to mend those fences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of the Senate Estimates hearings over the last couple of years I have tried to pursue some of the areas where taxpayers' money has been spent on that authority. We are all well aware of the $7m-odd of taxpayers' money that went missing as a result of this Government's mismanagement of funds that were being made available to a timber mill in Ravenshoe. I have been trying to pursue other areas where taxpayers' money has been spent to ascertain that it has in fact been spent wisely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in September of 1991 I asked for some details of a capital works program that the Wet Tropics Management Authority was proposing. I eventually received, in writing, some details of the capital works projects proposed by the Wet Tropics Management Authority, which totalled some $4.39m. Part of the detail that was given to me showed that some of the capital works money was to be used for the purchase of a residence for $250,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I subsequently sought some details about that residence. I was told on 16 October 1991 by Senator Richardson, then the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly), that he was advised that the residence was for Dr Peter Hitchcock who is the new boss of the authority. Senator Richardson said he would have that checked. He thought the residence was part of the package associated with Dr Hitchcock's appointment, and he was going to get back to me on that. He subsequently did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was told in writing that the provision of the house and the rental package constituted part of the conditions of employment of which candidates for the position of director were advised.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wet Tropics Management Agency will not purchase the residence. It will be purchased by the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage on behalf of the Wet Topics Management Agency. The residence will be in Cairns, where the director is stationed.</PARA>

I was told in an answer, which I only received on Thursday afternoon, just before this matter was intended to come before the Senate, that the housing package included in the advertised conditions for the position of director was not availed of by Dr Hitchcock. So, I am wondering, and my question to the Minister is:  who is now using the house?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That would not of itself have raised any eyebrows, except that it was later discovered that, in fact, Dr Vicki Pattemore is the wife of Dr Peter Hitchcock, the director. Some people in the Cairns area suggested to me that that was fairly inappropriate. That is not in any way saying that Dr Pattemore is not well qualified for the job, but that relationship between the director and one of the next stage of people in that particular authority was thought a bit unusual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be borne in mind that this authority was created in rather unusual and inflammatory circumstances at the time of the World Heritage listing. So it raised some eyebrows, particularly as I had been told some time before the matter was even advertised that Mr Hitchcock's wife would be getting the deputy director's job&mdash;although it seems not to have actually happened that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have raised this matter about Dr Pattemore before. In December 1991, when I raised it, I was told that Dr Pattemore had been appointed for a 12-month term on contract beginning on 29 July 1991 and, therefore, terminating at the end of July this year. In this year's Estimates hearings, I sought some information about that. I asked whether Dr Pattemore had applied for that position; whether she had been successful; what was the term of the new contract; what money was being paid to her; and what other fringe benefits, such as car transport, housing and rental packages, would be included in her new contract. Again, the Department could not give me an answer immediately, but referred to the Queensland office to provide an answer. I have just this morning received the answer, for which I thank the Department. It reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Officers of the Wet Tropics Management Authority are Queensland Government public servants and are appointed according to the principles established by the Queensland Public Sector Management Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>I was then told that these questions had to be referred to the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage. Based upon the information provided by that Department, I was provided with some information. In relation to Dr Pattemore's position, I was told this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The position of Manager (Program Coordination)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is Dr Pattemore's position&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was originally advertised as a permanent Public Service position. While the original appointment was made on a contract basis for twelve (12) months, this was an interim arrangement as the Queensland Government was phasing out the use of contracts for senior appointments.</PARA>
<PARA>That is news to me. That has not been mentioned before when I have questioned this. I always understood from previous information given to me that these appointments were simply on contract, that they were reviewable at the end of the term of the contract and then would be re-advertised and appointments made&mdash;maybe to the same person if that person proved to be successful. But there is now new information that apparently the appointment was to the permanent Public Service of Queensland all along. I will continue to quote from the answer that I have received:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many senior contract employees were advised in August 1991 of their entitlements to translate from contract employment to tenure under present award conditions. On 14 April, 1992 Dr Pattemore accepted an offer from the Director-General, Department of Environment and Heritage to convert her contract to tenure. It thus follows that the position was not re-advertised as no vacancy had occurred.</PARA>
<PARA>I asked about both the Director and Dr Pattemore, the Manager of Program Coordination, and I was advised of this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither position is a contract position&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which the previous answer made clear to me for the very first time&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The position of Director, Wet Tropics Management Agency, under approved Queensland Government translation arrangements, became a Senior Executive Service position (Level 2) with standard salary and benefits appropriate to the position.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, I am not very well aware of what those standard salary and benefits are, and I would have appreciated in the answer some details of just what that might be. I ask the Minister whether he can tell me that now. The answer continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A housing package was included in the advertised conditions for the position of Director. Dr Hitchcock has not availed himself of the housing benefit.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the matter that I mentioned before. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The position of Manager (Program Co-ordination)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is Dr Pattemore's position&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(Level AO8)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I guess that means something to people who are in the know; it does not mean anything to me&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has the same standard conditions of service which were offered to every Public Servant who translated from contract to tenure.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, that might be all very interesting if one is in the know, but I wonder whether someone could explain to me, in language that someone who is not in the Public Service can understand, what salaries both Dr Hitchcock and Dr Pattemore are receiving in their respective positions. What other salary packages do they have? Do I take it that their positions are now permanent and will never be terminated except by their consent or application? I also ask for details of any associated fringe benefits for either of them, such as the provision of car transport, a housing rental package or anything else. I wonder whether the Minister might now answer the questions I have raised, in a way that I and most other Australians can understand. </PARA>

It was something that the Federal Government&mdash;in direct contravention of the wishes of the then State Government, which the Minister now seems to be holding sacrosanct&mdash;at the time rammed through.

I raised another question in this same general area about a group called the Wet Tropics Community Consultative Committee, which is supposed to be a committee which represents the various sectors of the Far North Queensland community affected by the rainforest. Each member was originally selected, so the answer goes, to represent local government, the scientific community, conservation, industrial unions, educational, recreational, Aboriginal communities, tourism, mining and commerce. That always amuses me because this committee has taken a view in relation to the Tully-Millstream hydro-electricity project which is contrary, for example, to most of the local authorities in that particular region.</PARA></TALK.START>

I have information that suggests that there has been some divergence of views upon that committee. I inquired whether any members of that committee had resigned. I was told that one member, Mr Mike Reynolds, the former Labor mayor of Townsville, had resigned upon his moving to this fair city. I was aware of that. I had information that there had been another resignation as well. The information in the answer given to me suggests that that is not so.

Whilst there is some early commercial disagreement on the price that might be paid, we will find that everybody is quite keen on the idea that there be a guaranteed supply of water at all times&mdash;in drought, in summer and in winter&mdash;as a result of the Tully hydro extension scheme, should it proceed. Rather than holding back the white water rafting industry, it will enhance it quite considerably. They are the real facts of the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps I may proceed further in relation to the Tully-Millstream hydro project. I was given a written answer to some of the questions I raised in the Estimates Committee about this delay which I mentioned previously&mdash;a delay which I suggest is for political reasons, although the answer suggests differently. The answer says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the Queensland Government's decision to investigate all options for the future electricity needs of Queensland, the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments have been discussing processes for conducting further studies to assess the attractiveness of alternatives to the Tully Millstream scheme. The Wet Tropics Management Authority is also involved in these negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth's involvement relates to ensuring that the World Heritage values of the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area are adequately considered in the assessment process.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister would probably be aware&mdash;in case he is not, I will briefly recount&mdash;that there have already been about four major inquiries, one of which spent in excess of $5m to look very closely at all aspects, including the environmental aspects. When Senator Richardson was the relevant Minister he indicated that there was no problem with the World Heritage rules if it could be shown that the scheme was in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister may not be aware that there is no suggestion from reputable environmentalists of any damage to the wet tropics rainforest. In fact, there will be added to the wet tropics rainforest a greater area than will be inundated by the scheme. So there will be more coming in than goes out. The Minister may also not be aware that, if the grid which has been spoken about proceeds, the cost to the environment in the area that will need to be cleared in bringing the grid from the south up to Far North Queensland far exceeds the area that would have to be cleared if the Tully-Millstream hydro extension proceeds, creating an enormous number of jobs which are so desperately needed in this time of 11.3 per cent unemployment in our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This decision to assess the `attractiveness' of alternatives to the Tully-Millstream scheme is obviously something that Mrs Kelly is pushing, as has been her wont in many issues around Australia. When is it likely that this assessment might be concluded, bearing in mind that this has all been going on for many years? As one who lives in North Queensland, I share the view of my fellow citizens of that area that we need a guaranteed reliable supply of electricity in that area, which is subject to the dangers of cyclones, floods and other calamities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the best scheme suggested by the experts to ensure that guaranteed supply of electricity for the ever-expanding regions of North and Far North Queensland. In view of that, and in view of the delays that have occurred so far, I ask the Minister: when is it likely that these alternatives may eventually be assessed? There have been so many assessments so far, one would think there would be little left to assess. Possibly the Minister could assist me. </PARA>

The Australian Democrats have been arguing for a long time that the Federal Government should take a great deal more interest in this matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise the issue that is listed in the reservations against my name&mdash;the provision in 1991-92 and 1992-93 for the control of mimosa pigra, including its control on Aboriginal land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very important issue. I only hope that the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Coulter, can constrain himself from coming into the chamber to speak on this particular issue. A few moments ago he came to Senator Macdonald's assistance on another very important environmental issue&mdash;that relating to the wet tropics of North Queensland&mdash;and, of course, made a fool of himself. I hope that he will stay out of the chamber while I am addressing this terribly important issue that relates to the Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory. It is the sort of issue that I would have thought that the Australian Democrats would have been championing during the Estimates hearings and subsequently here in the Senate. But of course, the Australian Democrats do not know anything about money, cannot add up when it comes to Appropriations, and make no contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is a bit of a sideline from the important issue: the control of mimosa pigra. This issue has been raised a number of times. In fact, in the 1991-92 Budget the Government provided $2m for the first year of a five-year chemical and mechanical control program for mimosa pigra on the Oenpelli flood plains in the Northern Territory. What happened for the year 1992-93? Someone forgot to put any dough in; someone forgot to remember that there was a second year in a very important five-year program. The Government puts in $2m for year one and then for the second year it completely omits it, loses it and forgets it, and it disappears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put a series of questions on notice to the Senate Estimates in early September, and I am afraid I was given what can only be described as very much a round-robin <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS> type answer with which I am not satisfied. In my first question I asked what provisions had been made for the financial years&mdash;that is, 1991-92, the first year, and 1992-93? I got an answer that yes, $2m was provided for the first year, and the final part of the answer to that question was, `Consideration is being given to the provision of additional funds for the program'. Whereabouts? It is not in the Budget Papers. There is no provision for $2m this year, and yet that would be the absolute minimum that would be required to maintain this particular program. I ask the Minister to address that very important issue. Is it going into some Supplementary Estimates? Is it coming out of a Minister's slush fund in some area?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second question I asked was whether the program is subject to a long term commitment&mdash;I stress those words&mdash;and what will be the consequences to the Kakadu National Park, Arnhem Land and other areas of an uncontrolled mimosa invasion. Again, the answer goes round and round the question talking about the work of CSIRO and talking about the strategically important aspects of containing the eastward spread to Arnhem Land. The final sentence of that particular answer is: `The continued spread of mimosa constitutes a threat to the biological diversity of Australia's tropical wetlands'. What an acknowledgment&mdash;a very major important point, but no acceptance whatsoever of a long term commitment. The second year of a five-year program has dropped out. What will happen to years three, four and five if we cannot even get the cash in there for the second year?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third question I asked was: what arrangements had been put together with the Northern Territory Government for support on this particular program? I got an answer that talked about the Northern Territory Minister for Primary Industry and Fisheries having written to Mrs Kelly on 7 July 1992&mdash;just after the financial year started&mdash;expressing concern that funding for the Oenpelli project had been discontinued. The NT Minister wrote again on 16 October 1992 indicating that the Northern Territory may be in a position to increase its support for a broadened mimosa control program. I checked with Minister Reed's office today as to whether anything had been developed or further advanced on this issue, and I was told, `No, the matter is sitting in limbo'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that I asked these questions on, I think, 4 September, that they went on notice, that these answers were given to me in October and that we are now into November, where is the commitment to at least $2m in this financial year for the second year of a five-year program? Where is the answer to the Northern Territory Government's offer to be involved in the program? What is the Commonwealth's long term commitment to this very important environmental disaster?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an issue of which I am very much aware, because my colleague Warren Snowdon, the honourable member for the Northern Territory, has discussed it with me on a number of occasions, even though I am not the portfolio Minister. He does so because he is very keen to lobby Cabinet Ministers, whether they have the portfolio or not, when it comes to issues relating to the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to this problem, he was keen&mdash;the Government by its recent decision indicated and reflected that keenness&mdash;to take a continuing interest in the problem. As we know, the Commonwealth provided $2m in 1991-92. In doing so, we have intended to embark upon a five-year program, with joint funding, with the Territory Government and the Aboriginal communities involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is fair to say that the Territory Government has not been keen to meet us in relation to the program. That is the advice I am getting. To that extent, we have obtained funding by way of additional estimates. That goes back to one of Senator Tambling's questions. We have planned funding for the second year of the program by way of additional estimates. Cabinet decided that in October and we agreed to provide up to $1.046m to continue the program into 1993, subject to details being settled. I am also advised that another $64,000 is coming from another program which will also be used with respect to the same problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is still our intention to embark upon a long term program and to do so in conjunction with the Northern Territory Government. That of course would be the preferred approach and it is an approach that we will pursue. As I said at the outset, Parliamentary Secretary Snowdon has been very keen to keep this issue alive on the political agenda, on the financing agenda, and I am sure Senator Tambling would recognise the work Mr Snowdon has done on this. Senator Tambling would also appreciate that the Government still intends to treat this as a longer term problem, with the cooperation of the Territory Government and the Aboriginal communities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly note Mr Snowdon's interest in this area as put forward by the Minister.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the Minister's point. Obviously the Cabinet chose to ignore Mr Snowdon's earlier advice. However, given that additional estimates have now been provided for year two at $1.046m, how does that vary from the original intent of the five-year program? What in total was in the original Cabinet endorsed submission for the five-year program? What were the phased amounts that were originally intended? How does the $1m now stack up against the $2m for year one and the total component? Senator Bolkus said that he had been looking for contact with the Northern Territory Government. In light of Northern Territory Minister Reed's letters of 7 July and 16 October, when has Minister Kelly or any other Minister or government officer specifically replied in writing and indicated the Commonwealth's firm intention on this matter?</PARA></TALK.START>

Keep in mind that there has been expenditure for capital equipment in that first financial year, which capital equipment will be used in an ongoing program.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will give this part of the answer and offer to provide further information if there needs to be any. I think it is important for the Committee to recognise that the initial five-year program was embarked upon with an anticipated expenditure of some $5.086m over three years. To date, as Senator Tambling knows, we have spent $2m and then $1.1m. If there is some difference between that and what might be spent next year, which may or may not get us up to the $5.086m, Senator Tambling wants to know what the difference is between what had been budgeted for and what has been finally met. We will take that question on notice and, if there is anything, come back to Senator Tambling. It may very well be that the expenditure so far has covered the areas that needed to be covered. There might also very well be a revision of that $5.086m which might be justifiable. I do not want to pre-empt any of that, but we will get the information for Senator Tambling.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. I would appreciate you considering it while I complete the question. I am conscious of the fact that the fuel excise tax was originally raised to fund roads. Of course, that was when it was 6c or 7c a litre; it is now 26c a litre. In fact, one of the operators that works on the Barrier Reef raised this very point with me. He said, `Look, we have to pay the Commonwealth fuel excise on all the fuel we use on our boats. We pay 26c a litre for that'. He acknowledged that under this Government some 19c a litre goes simply to the general revenue, but he pointed out to me that at least 6c or 7c of that 26c a litre that this Government extracts as tax did go to roads. He said to me, `We pay the full fuel tax of 26c a litre, including the 6c or 7c a litre for roads, but our boats never drive on a road; they always go on the sea'. He asked, `Why could not that amount of money be appropriated quite sensibly for research into the Barrier Reef rather than be used for road construction and maintenance?'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of doing that, this Government chooses to extract the whole 26c a litre from those reef operators as just another tax, giving nothing back, and then, in addition to that, wants to impose a specific reef tax on all those small business operators who operate in that reef area&mdash;people who are the most careful with the reef, the ones who protect it because it is their livelihood as well as being a national treasure. Yet this Government comes along and intends to impose yet another tax on those small business people, a reef tax which is intended to again tax small business&mdash;tax those in the tourist area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have asked the Minister: what are the details of that reef tax; who is going to pay it; how is it going to be collected; and how much is it? The Government has been talking about it for some three or four months now, but I will guarantee to you, Mr Chairman, that you will not get a decision until after the election because this Government, unlike the new incoming Government, is not prepared to be honest about its policies. It is not prepared to tell the people of Australia what taxes it intends to impose, whereas the Liberal and National parties are very open and honest about that. We will tell the people what this is all about, but this Government will hide this reef tax, will disguise it, will keep putting it off&mdash;the same as it is doing with Tully-Millstream&mdash;until such time as the election is over, and then it will come in and impose yet another tax on small business in the tourist areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a number of questions and issues that arose from the Estimates Committee considerations. I am pleased to see that Senator Coulter is still in the chamber taking a latter-day interest in the appropriations. In view of the very important national parks that are located on both Cocos and Christmas Islands and the very significant impact on those national parks as a result of the Government's proposed expenditure programs, I sincerely trust that the Australian Democrats will take a very keen interest in these appropriations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Government is planning something like $130m worth of capital works and infrastructure program on Christmas Island, some $42m of which has already been committed to the next few years of the first stage of that program. Of course, we see a very expansive annual budget&mdash;I think it now exceeds some $30m per annum&mdash;in each of these communities. Honourable senators will note, from the reservations that I have expressed and that I wish to take up, that many of these  impinge on the environmental aspects of these important islands, whether it is casinos, the way in which freight and stevedoring will operate, or the commercial activities on the islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the first reservation that I have expressed. That relates to the completion date of the Christmas Island casino development. This is an important development that is being developed principally by Indonesian interests. I think the last estimate that I heard for the construction cost of the casino itself was in the order of $50m or $60m. There has been an ongoing saga of construction delays with regard to this project. In early September I put a question on notice, to which I received a reply in October. I asked for now proposed revised completion dates of that casino, the reasons for the delay, and various other police matters that I want to raise separately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to this continuing moving feast of a saga with regard to the completion dates. I would like to ascertain, given that the date has now moved out and is being suggested in answer No. 1 of the questions on notice to be in approximately April or May 1993, what revision that will require to the estimates of income that have been put forward in the Budget Estimates for this current financial year. What will be the change in the estimates of income that will attribute to the Commonwealth in this financial year?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst one of the answers to questions on notice recognised that there would also be savings to the Commonwealth in costs for regulation of the casino, I would also ask: what will be the savings to the Commonwealth in those administrative areas?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am disappointed in the Minister's answer, given the extent of the answer that was given to the question on notice which has been before the Government since early September. I would have felt that the Department would have been well-briefed and that these matters would have been well-known to the Minister at this time, particularly as there has been quite a keen interest in the development of this casino.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I will turn to my second reservation. That relates to Australian Federal Police investigations with regard to this particular operation. I have raised this matter now, I think, for several years in both the Estimates Committee hearings and in the Senate, and I have been very concerned. This matter goes back to 1991. I know that the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, which was looking into a reference on legal casinos and organised criminal activity, reported to this Parliament in June of 1992. Essentially, in June of 1992, that parliamentary Committee decided to put on hold the determination of its inquiry into casino activity throughout Australia. As part of its conclusions, the Committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee emphasises that it is not terminating its inquiry. Early in the next Parliament the Committee will review the decision to suspend its inquiry. In doing so, it will take into account any action by governments in response to the NSW and NCA Inquiries, and whether the Royal Commission has reported and sufficient time has elapsed for its findings to be acted upon.</PARA>
<PARA>So, we can anticipate that early in the next Parliament, the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority will again be looking at this matter. Given that I have had questions before the Estimates Committee and the Department and before the Senate since well into early 1992, I am concerned about the answer to my question about what further inquiries were going on. The answer that was given to me was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Federal Police is carrying out revised security clearances for all parties involved in the resort casino project. The AFP has advised that its overseas inquiries have been completed and a report is presently being prepared.</PARA>
<PARA>Given that that answer was drafted and presented over a month ago, I would now like to ascertain what further reporting has been made to the Government with regard to these Australian Federal Police inquiries. What has been their outcome?  How is it going to impact on the operation and the starting up of the casino on Christmas Island?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The piece of paper I have been given does not go to that question. The question basically is: have we been advised by the AFP since late September when it was supposed to have finalised its overseas inquiries?  The last part goes to revised completion dates and savings. The advice that Senator Tambling has been given is that the AFP has advised that it intends to finalise overseas inquiries by late September 1992. All other inquiries have been concluded. In fact, I might give this whole answer, just to put it in context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last few years checks have been carried out on all the major individuals and companies associated with the casino by the AFP, the Foreign Investment Review Board and the National Crime Authority. Revised security clearances have only recently been completed by the AFP. It should be noted that details of these inquiries are, as usual, confidential to the AFP. However, I am advised that the broad outcome is that during the extensive inquiries, both in Australia and overseas, no evidence indicated that any of the persons or companies involved with the casino were unsuitable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to read a five-paragraph statement that has been forwarded to me, which is information from the Department. Indian Ocean Airlines began operating the air service to Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in June 1992 under an agreement with the Commonwealth, which Senator Tambling knows about. IOA did not provide the service required under the agreement, in part due to delays in bringing its plane, an Electra, into service. The last service provided by IOA was on 19 September 1992.

He indicated that he was prepared to assist State candidates; and he indicated to where those  candidates should direct inquiries regarding cuttings.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the first day of his mock election campaign, federal Opposition leader Andrew Peacock publicly accused one of the senior journalists covering the event of being under the influence of the "thought police". This is Peacock's new name for the National Media Liaison Service (more commonly known as the aNiMaLS) which embarrasses the coalition from time to time by distributing transcripts of silly, contradictory or indiscreet statements by leading lights of the Liberals and Nationals. The journalist had discomforted Peacock by quoting one of his statements made months before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, on the final day of the electioneering dry run, Liberal front-bench senator Robert Hill launched a full-scale attack on the aNiMaLS&mdash;alleging that the organisation, funded by taxpayers, had been politicised. Since former journalist Colin Parks who heads the aNiMaLS has never claimed his role is anything other than political, it was hardly a breathtaking revelation. Hill accused Parks and his staff of taking minute differences between Opposition spokesmen and "blowing them out of all proportion". It seems not to have occurred to Hill that it is political journalists and their editors&mdash;not the aNiMaLS&mdash;who determine how material in any transcript is interpreted and whether it is played up, played down or ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's paranoia about the Parks operation is not hard to understand. The Liberals have had a healthy respect for the power of the transcript and the monitored quote since the 1980 election campaign. They are convinced that an undisciplined comment about capital gains taxes made in a remote part of Australia by Labor's Senator Peter Walsh won that election for the coalition. Walsh's comment was picked up through a media monitoring operation organised by Liberal federal director Tony Eggleton. With the opinion polls showing Malcolm Fraser losing, the transcript provided the basis for a desperate but successful coalition counter-attack in the final week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the aNiMaLS are feared. Because they are feared, they are attacked. And a good argument can be mounted that some of things they do would be more appropriately funded by a political party than by government revenue. Unfortunately for the coalition parties, however, they are in no position to take the high moral ground because the aNiMaLS simply replaced a similar body which operated under the Fraser government. Peacock and Hill seem conveniently to have forgotten that, in some important respects, the Fraser version&mdash;called the Government Information Unit&mdash;was more blatantly party political than the Parks group is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New evidence to illustrate this is in a document found in a file left by the GIU staff when it was disbanded by the Hawke government in 1983. Classified "confidential" and dated December 1978, the document sets out duties of GIU liaison officers to be stationed in each capital. One aspect of the role was "to monitor, analyse and report on television and radio current affairs and comment programs as they affect the Commonwealth Government in any way". That could serve just as well as a summary of the monitoring activities of the aNiMaLS. More significantly in this context, each liaison officer was to "maintain close contact with party officials in the state, keeping them fully informed of developments on the federal scene". That party was not Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In April 1981, Labor's John Dawkins tabled in parliament leaked Liberal Party documents which showed how closely meshed the GIU was with the Liberal organisation. The documents were minutes and agendas of meetings at the Liberal secretariat to plan the party's 1980 election campaign and they contained references to the GIU. They showed, for example, that GIU head Vincent Matthews attended a meeting at the secretariat to plan the party's media monitoring operation&mdash;the very operation that caught Walsh out on capital gains. According to the agenda, the GIU was to liaise with Liberal campaign headquarters over monitoring. GIU officers in each state were to collaborate with state Liberal Party directors in the preparation of "political climate" reports. The GIU was to be asked to report on placement of campaign advertisements. And so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1982, minutes of a Tasmanian Liberal Party campaign committee meeting tabled in the Senate showed that the GIU's Hobart-based officer Bruce Montgomery had attended. The meeting was to prepare the Liberal campaign for a state election. And then there was the Arnis Verbickis memo, which led to Labor allegations that the GIU was not only an appendage of the Liberal Party but engaged in a dirty tricks campaign as well. Verbickis, working for the GIU in Melbourne, penned a note on how Derryn Hinch should be handled when he interviewed Fraser or other Ministers on radio. Someone, Verbickis advised, should remain outside the studio to talk to and "disturb" Hinch's producer and researcher who would otherwise feed questions and follow-up points to him through headphones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Peacock, of all people, should be under no illusion about the GIU's political role. In May 1982, having resigned from cabinet and preparing to challenge Fraser for the leadership, Peacock held a news conference in Melbourne. A GIU officer attended with tape recorder so that Fraser could be informed immediately of everything Peacock said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it was closed, the GIU had a staff of 19 and was about to increase its size to 21 by opening an office in Darwin. The aNiMaLS full-time staff totals 21. The GIU's budget for 1982-83 was $1.4 million. The cost of the aNiMaLS operation in 1986-87 was less than $1.1 million. The aNiMaLS staff members are not public servants; they are employed under the act covering ministerial staff, as were those who worked for the GIU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the coalition parties are in no position to throw stones. The Hawke government simply pinched their idea, though Parks' operation is without doubt more effective. There is no point in senior Liberals whingeing. If they genuinely think it is a bad thing, they can set an example by leaving all such activities to the Liberal Party organisation when they return to office. But, somehow, I think the temptation to have the taxpayers subsidise such activities will continue to prove irresistible&mdash;no matter what they say now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that if shadow Ministers and senior party officials did not make silly, contradictory or indiscreet statements, the aNiMaLS would not be a problem anyway.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Oakes then goes on to look at the way that the Government Information Unit in the days of the Fraser Government not only acted in a more blatantly party political way than the current group is acting but also involved itself in intraparty fighting. He quotes an instance where, according to the agenda&mdash;the agenda which had been leaked and found after the 1980 election campaign&mdash;the head of the GIU was to liaise with the Liberal campaign headquarters over monitoring. He then goes on to refer to the GIU in Victoria and states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I suppose that note would be useful to us all now. Oakes makes the point that the GIU was involved in this level as well. He makes another interesting point in the article when he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Peacock, of all people, should be under no illusion about the GIU's political role. In May 1982, having resigned from cabinet and preparing to challenge Fraser for the leadership, Peacock held a news conference in Melbourne.

<PARA>In the second last paragraph, Mr Oakes draws the following conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So the coalition parties are in no position to throw stones&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>alluding to the headline about people in glasshouses. Senator Macdonald went back to 1989, but unfortunately, without adequate resources or the memory that some of us have, he forgot the 1989 article written by Laurie Oakes which draws a very good and clear comparison between the roles of aNiMaLS now and the GIU then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that Laurie would not have been able to write about then, but it is worth putting on the record now, is that, in comparison with the Fraser Government's GIU&mdash;which also employed some 19 staff&mdash;it spent some $2.25m or a massive 39.9 per cent more in 1992-93 dollar terms in its final year of operation. I am informed that this aNiMaLS operation spent some $1.354m in 1991-92. The GIU, in 1992-93 dollar terms, spent some 39.9 per cent more than that&mdash;$2.25m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make those two points because an organisation such as this has been a feature of government in this country for the duration of two governments&mdash;if not the Whitlam Government before that. I cannot remember that far back, although I was working here at the time. It was very much a characteristic of the Fraser Government and it involved itself in activities which, as Mr Oakes says, were blatantly more party political than the activities of the current organisation. I put that on the record for a start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Senator Macdonald's specific question about the 1992 election, I am informed that aNiMaLS did not involve itself in any way in that State election. On the further question Senator Macdonald raised about Mr Lindsay, my advice is that no arrangement exists with him that is outside part 8 of Senator Richardson's answer, which is the one Senator Macdonald referred to.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer you, Mr Chairman, and also Senator Macdonald, to the established guidelines for this organisation. We can understand from those guidelines that there is limited access to the organisation for backbenchers&mdash;government, opposition or even Democrat. Any operation of the organisation is within those guidelines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of those guidelines, I refer Senator Macdonald to the role and functions of the organisation. There is a specific role which prohibits representatives from working with `local or State party branches and will not be involved in party programs or electoral campaigning'. It is an important limit which goes very much to the heart of the question which Senator Macdonald raised in respect of the 1992 State election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister can understand why I do not take much notice of that. Certainly in regard to the 1989 election there was quite specific evidence, in the form of a letter, suggesting something to the contrary. So he can understand why I am somewhat sceptical of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, could the Minister indicate why it would not be appropriate for the organisation to pull out the transcripts it has done? I am sure it has the time&mdash;we have been through this before&mdash;as it has about three people in Townsville to do a job which I have indicated to the Minister my office girl does in the way of the clipping service. It seems to have plenty of people there. But if it was very busy in the lead-up to the next election, I would quite willingly let my staff go out and do the photocopying so it would not cost the organisation anything. What would be wrong with doing that? It is a publicly funded organisation. It does not do anything that is political. It only does things that are on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Minister were to let me look at those documents it would dispel the suspicion that I have, which comes to me on advice from the media around the place, that it was in fact being used in the 1992 Queensland election campaign. If the Minister could let me have those statements maybe that would clear the matter up once and for all and would enable me to apologise for the suggestion. It would not cost anything. Sure, the guidelines are there, but why? Possibly the Minister could answer that question. </PARA>

Maybe aNiMaLS was being blamed for the media discovering that. That came from non-aNiMaLS sources.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, the next few months, unless the Government is going to have a dictatorship, which I suppose is on the cards, and abandon elections. My understanding of the official role of the National Media Liaison Service is to disseminate government information. What I mean by that is information in respect of what the Government does in the Parliament, disseminated to the public. Does it have a role and, if so, what is that role in respect of tracking information that is disseminated by the Opposition? For example, in the event of shadow Ministers or the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, giving a speech of some magnitude, is that transcribed and is it then sent around to all the Ministers or to the press secretaries of the various Ministers?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE Leader of the federal Opposition, Dr Hewson, confirmed for the first time last night that coalition staffers were responsible for distributing anonymously documents aimed at supporting Dr Hewson's accusations about the Labor Party's NSW Right.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his first step backwards since the furore over his remarks comparing the NSW right to the Mafia, Dr Hewson said it had been a mistake to attempt to circulate the so-called "dirt file" on the activities of members of the NSW right last Friday.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until yesterday, Dr Hewson had denied all knowledge off the thick wad of documents left mysteriously in the mail boxes of the parliamentary press gallery in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But last night he told the ABC's Lateline program he had since established that "enthusiastic staffers" were responsible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Acknowledging how this could be seen as an orchestrated smear campaign against the faction to which the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, belongs, Dr Hewson described it as a "silly exercise" and denied it was part of Coalition strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was during a censure motion against the Speaker, Mr Leo MacLeay, over his conduct of proceedings in Parliament last Thursday that Dr Hewson attacked.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yesterday, Dr Hewson was still refusing to withdraw his accusations, in which he had said the NSW Right stretched from "our jails in certain parts of the country right through to the top office".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Keating has challenged Dr Hewson either to withdraw the allegations or repeat them outside Parliament so Mr Keating and other members of the faction would have recourse to legal action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But in interviews yesterday, Dr Hewson again refused to do either.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Keating had used Parliament to make otherwise defamatory remarks: "He has called me a supporter of apartheid in South Africa, a cheat and a fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition accused Mr MacLeay of bias and said this had become more noticeable since Mr Keating became Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last night, Mr Keating staunchly defended Mr MacLeay, despite a belief even on the part of some within the ALP that the Speaker's performance had been inept.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr MacLeay's performance was "as impartial as it ought to be". Mr Keating conceded the NSW right had been subjected to allegations of bashing "but so what in terms of all the good people that are part and parcel of the Labor Party in NSW".</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A MORGAN Gallup Poll to be published today shows the Federal Government continues to narrow the gap in public support between itself and the Coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The poll, to be published in Time, shows support for the Government rose half a percentage point last month to 40 per cent. Coalition support fell 1 to 44.5.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The approval rating of the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, rose 1 more point to 40 per cent. His disapproval rating fell for the first time since February, from 48 to 47.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Hewson's approval and disapproval ratings stayed 50 and 35 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On who would make the better prime minister, Mr Keating fell 1 point to 42 per cent. Dr Hewson stayed at 44.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NATIONAL AFFAIRS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The press office of the Opposition Leader is also a single-issue publishing house. Barely a day passes without the release of at least one weighty new title, well-documented, illustrated with tables and graphs and usually including an appendix of primary and secondary-source material.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This week's official publications included `Documenting the risks, III', the third in an uncompelling series called `Where is the money coming from?'. It sank without trace.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If politics is a war and press releases are the bullets, then the Opposition is perhaps the most heavily armed, but least efficient, unit in history. Like Iraqi Scuds, its missiles tend to fall short of their target. `Dad's Army' had a better hit rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While Paul Keating has been stripping the political debate to its barest essentials&mdash;crudely and often unfairly reducing Dr Hewson's 800-page Fightback strategy to the impost of a new tax and an assault on unions&mdash;the publishing unit has been tackling such accessible concepts as unfunded sales tax concessions to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, according to one well-placed observer, "it just hasn't hit. No one understands `net endogenous imports' or the `GDP price deflator'. Everyone understands sleaze.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So it was that this week, after surrendering the parliamentary ascendancy to one who relies on raw political instinct more than any other PM before him, John Hewson decided to hit back and opt for sleaze.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His "Mafia" description of the Prime Minister's faction, the New South Wales Right, was no top-of-the-head rhetorical flourish.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was planned in advance as a kind of if-you-can't-beat-them-join-them response to a Prime Minister who, according to one on the coalition's side, has lately appeared "virile, aggressive and powerful".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was followed, coincidentally, by the release of an unofficial publication, a wad of material on the faction's past deeds, material dropped into the boxes of the parliamentary press gallery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bulk of it was made up of press clippings, but in my own case (and probably the case of others) it included confidential documents including the police record of an interview with Peter Baldwin, now a federal minister, after his bashing in Sydney in 1980.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then a state politician, Mr Baldwin had been investigating alleged corruption in some ALP branches.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Hewson's office has distanced itself from the release of material, but sees political capital in Mr Keating's membership of the faction and has no concern about pursuing the matter when Parliament resumes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In stooping to the parliamentary invective he railed against on his arrival as Liberal leader, Dr Hewson is doing more than sullying the image of the political cleanskin, an image that was slipping anyway as he established himself as an adept performer on the hustings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In an immediate sense, the effect has been to dull the impact of an extraordinary, and justified, attack on the partiality and competence of the speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Leo McLeay, a factional ally of Mr Keating who is seen by a number in his party as an embarrassment in the position. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a broader sense, Dr Hewson allowed Mr Keating to again divert attention from the main game: the economy and the level of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The attack was seen by Labor strategists as a massive mistake by a thin-skinned and increasingly brittle Opposition Leader.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But there is also danger for Mr Keating, whose disproportionate response guaranteed a bigger spotlight on the remarks (and the record and reputation of the faction) than would otherwise have been the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The escalation of bitterness between the two leaders carries the danger of diminishing the public regard for both sides, but things are likely to get more intense, not less, in the final days before Saturday's Wills byelection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As one in the Hewson camp was heard to remark of Dr Hewson's Mafia jibe: "I think it's the smartest thing he has said in months.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the report of Estimates Committee D. The Committee noted that some DAS business units had attracted criticism from competitors in the private sector. This matter was canvassed during the Estimates hearings and I do not intend to go over it all again, but I will ask a few questions about it. Some of it relates to one of the reservations I put in, but it does generally apply to all the commercial services of DAS. The remark was made in the Estimates hearings that the commercial operations within DAS had costs that the private sector did not have. Could the Minister spell out to me what those costs are that do not exist in the private sector?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of costs which DAS services have to meet, which costs are not those that are normally met by the private sector. For instance, there are the costs of accountability through mechanisms such as this; costs of accountability to Ministers; costs of meeting occupational health and safety provisions, EEO provisions and provisions pertaining to the public sector in general; and costs of superannuation. For example, we pay award rates and conditions in the Commonwealth car area where our competitors, more often than not, are private contractors. So there is a whole host of costs that add up to at least 5 to 8 per cent of running costs when one calculates the actual level of them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for that response. I would be the first to recognise that this has become prominent in recent years, when the various departments in government have been untied from DAS, and that three or four years ago, for instance, a lot of the work that is currently going out for tender would have automatically been done by DAS, and this is part of the commercialisation process. I do recognise that. But the argument put by the private sector is that the commercial operations in DAS do not pay things like sales tax, fuel excise on the Department's vehicles, or payroll tax. One area that is of some concern&mdash;and I will come to it later when we come to Comcar&mdash;is the degree, if any, to which the commercial operations of DAS comply with State laws.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take the tax aspect first. Following on from the previous question asked by Senator Parer, not only does the Department have those extra costs, but also it should be recognised that the degree of non-Commonwealth work carried out by DAS is, under the Constitution, limited to the exhausting of surplus capacity resulting from the servicing of the needs of the Commonwealth. It should also be kept in mind that DAS charges market rates. I think it was Senator Parer in the Estimates committee process who said that in this area we are talking more about a problem of perception rather than reality. There were a couple of quotes to that extent during the committee process which I think basically summed up and reflected the situation pretty well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only do we talk about market rates, but our guidelines require that we meet the provisions of the Trade Practices Act. As a general policy, DAS meets relevant Commonwealth sales tax, customs duties or excise when undertaking non-Commonwealth work. There are some exemptions when the level of work involved is insufficient to warrant such payments. In those circumstances, our market rates prevent any unfair advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of State tax and charges, I have decided that where DAS groups undertake non-Commonwealth work an amount equivalent to the relevant State taxes should be set aside so that these costs are reflected on each business's bottom line. We are in the process of making arrangements to implement this change at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to other laws of States, we are in the same position as any other Federal Government department, and that is that we have no legal obligation to meet the requirements of State legislation. There was a case recently which was settled before it went to the High Court. As one of the terms of settlement, I agreed that we should pay a pro rata amount to the New South Wales Government in terms of the Commonwealth car fleet and its operation to the extent that it does private work in New South Wales. But I think, as a general rule, the Commonwealth has always accepted the fact that, when it comes to provision of car parking or whatever, we are immune from the levying of State requirements, and that comes from the Constitution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has not been brought to our attention. Now that it has, we will obviously have a look at it. From my appreciation of the reputation of Asset Services, I think that the operator Senator Parer is talking about may actually have enhanced prospects because of being tied to us, rather than the negative response that he might have been inferring. Given the way he has commended the Department in recent months, I am sure that he also recognises the reputation that Asset Services, amongst other arms of the Department, is now developing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic point is that we do not have to comply with State requirements. It would be very difficult for an organisation such as ours that has been around for a while operating nationally to be precluded from using a name because of an isolated operator in one part of Australia. I will take on board the point that Senator Parer raises and see whether there is any way we can prevent this in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The remark I made was, in fact, made by the organisation itself. I think the plumbing service said that, because of the confusion, it received some sort of tender papers meant for Asset Services. Of course, we have had the growth of the commercial operations in DAS encroaching into the private sector, which is causing some concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, rather than dealing with a problem as it might occur in the future, we are dealing here with a person who in good faith has operated an organisation by that name and, if my memory is correct, well before the term `Asset Services' was used by ACS, going back to 1984 or 1983. Even though, constitutionally, I would have to agree with the Minister that the Government is immune and is entitled to ride over the top of that group, having gone down the track of commercialisation, I wonder whether he could address that issue and perhaps have some discussions with this operator with a view to solving what is a problem for him and his wife. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will follow the running sheet. Although the matter I want to raise could well be covered in subprogram 1.2 or subprogram 1.3, I will raise it now under the reservation noted in this part. The Minister has touched on market price. I asked in the Estimates Committee hearing what was meant by market price. It was fairly obvious then that there was not really a great understanding of what `market price' is except `the price we need to quote to get the business'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During Estimates the remark was made, `Yes, quotations are made of marginal costs at times when there is surplus labour available'. I would be interested to know the extent of that. One of the great dangers of any commercial operation is that if the habit of quoting at marginal cost grows, that becomes the norm rather than the exception. It is the quickest way for organisations to go broke. We have heard numerous reports about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only about a week or so ago I was told of a tender by Asset Services in Wagga Wagga to the New South Wales housing department. Tenders went out, and a price came in at $8,000. Subsequently, the successful tenderer was advised that he had been unsuccessful because DAS had come in with a price of $4,000, which would have covered only the electricity and the plumbing. These examples are growing. To what extent, and on what basis, are these quotations being made?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister will recall during Estimates that we gave the example of the Lavarack Barracks.

We talked earlier about perceptions. That is the sort of perception that must be responded to by the Department. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To the extent that I do not answer Senator Parer's question, I will come back with further information. I can remember the part of the Estimates Committee hearing when the question of marginal costs arose. My understanding is that we cover direct costs plus we provide for an allocation towards profits that we have to meet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Lavarack Barracks, my recollection is that the evidence given at that stage might have been a bit contradictory. On the one hand, it was made clear that we were already in place there. It would have cost much less for us to do the work than, I suppose, competitors, because we had people stationed there already and there would not have been costs related to transport and those sorts of things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The officers then went on to say that we were talking about marginal costs; that is my recollection, and I think it is also Senator Parer's recollection. The general rule is that we cover direct costs plus a profit margin. Senator Parer is basically asking to what extent that is not operating. To the extent that it is not, I will come back to him. But as a general rule applied almost universally, that direct cost assessment is the way that we are going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of assertions have been put to me about unfair competition from Administrative Services. I see that very much as a question of perception rather than reality, although all instances are being closely scrutinised. In this context&mdash;and Senator Parer was gracious enough to make the point at the start&mdash;whereas some two, three or four years ago all the work that we are talking about now would have been conducted by Administrative Services or its predecessors, some 70 per cent of the work we now do is open to competition. By the end of this financial year it will be as high as 95 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are now massive opportunities for the private sector that were not there before. I say that for two reasons. First, it gives the private sector opportunities, and I wish it would take them up rather than expend energy grizzling about them. Secondly, I see this process as being a successful one in that, as Senator Parer knows, it has led to massive savings to government over recent years&mdash;some $200m or so per annum. The imperative of competition is being applied to work that was previously tied work. As an experiment, it is working well. I throw out the challenge to the private sector to go in and compete with us, because through that competition both the private sector and the public sector will develop. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister and I accept what he said. I am pursuing this line of questioning because the private sector wants to determine whether it is worth meeting the cost of quoting if the quotes submitted by DAS do not reflect its cost or the market cost. I would be interested in the response, which I do not want now but at some later date, as to what percentage of work done by the various commercial sectors of DAS would be considered to be in accordance with the description the Minister gave, which was costs plus mark-up or reasonable profit&mdash;whatever he likes to call it.</PARA></TALK.START>

Some 600 or so people who are superfluous to the commercial operations of DAS have been transferred to another section of DAS. There is provision within the Estimates of either some $50m or $70m to cover those people; I am not too sure whether that would be for redundancies or continuing salaries.

Presumably because there is provision within the Forward Estimates of the Budget to cater for those people, the various commercial sectors of DAS no longer have to provide within their own budgets for the costs associated with those people whom they believe will be superfluous. This could be construed as a fairly artificial way for one of the commercial services, be it Asset Services, Project Services or any other commercial operation, to reduce its costs of operation. They can do so by transferring staff across to another part of DAS where they sit waiting for some agreement to be made with the Public Service union.</PARA></TALK.START>

I would like to know what that was, because the Minister made a remark before which I found somewhat disturbing that the arrangement was that when Comcar engaged in private work it would pay a pro rata fee. If my memory is correct, hire cars in New South Wales pay an annual fee of about $15,000 per car. If they are going into that business, they do not pay a pro rata fee; they pay a fee of $15,000 and take their chances on the amount of work they will get.

For the September quarter of 1992, private sector work has risen to just one per cent of our revenue. So we off-load some 19 per cent of our work onto our competitors and we pick up some one per cent. Under constitutional restraints, Comcar will be able to use only its excess capacity and we will not be able to go into the market wholesale; nor would we want to.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said in answer to Senator Parer a few minutes ago, in 1991-92 the overall Comcar revenue received from the private sector work was 0.2 per cent. For this financial year, for instance, in the September quarter, it has risen marginally to just on one per cent of revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, it will always be incidental; it will be Comcar attempting to use up excess capacity. To the extent that we do that, we will have private sector customers and obviously approach private sector customers. But it is very much our intention to keep that as an incidental part of our work. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will be incidental to our main object of existence, that being to provide services to government. As I say, it is one per cent for the September quarter. The figure the honourable senator quoted earlier of 0.8 per cent relates to WA. That was the level of private sector work done by Comcar in WA for 1991-92, but overall across the country it was 0.2 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make two extra points that need to be made. I preface my remarks by stressing that we are talking about Comcar using our excess capacity and finding the strategic private sector customers to utilise that excess capacity only. The New South Wales High Court case ensures that some State fees and charges will be paid, and I have taken measures to ensure that that occurs&mdash;despite the fact that not only do we have the 5 to 8 per cent extra costs operating across the board to government services through DAS because of obligations we have to meet that are not met by the private sector but we also have award rates and conditions to pay whereas our private sector competitors do not. I am assured that whatever State fees and charges are not payable will be extracted from the organisation to level out the playing field once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I make is that, quite honestly, I do not know where the attack is coming from. On the one hand Dr Hewson says he will not use Comcar because it is too expensive and on the other hand we have criticism saying that it is unfairly competing with the private sector because we reduce our prices. It is fair to say that we are having, and will have, only a very minor part of private sector work. We are not going out into the marketplace to take over the private sector. We are providing an elite service and charging those sorts of prices. We will continue to do so. My aim is to ensure that the organisation operates efficiently without detriment to not only the private sector, but also the public purse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree that Comcar is too expensive, and that is part of the problem. I am trying to highlight the fact that the private sector&mdash;whether the Minister wishes to accept it or not&mdash;is very concerned. Just because I happened not to be on duty at that time, the Minister is now too bull-headed to explain to me what the situation is. We are now back to where we were at a quarter to four this afternoon when the Minister was refusing to answer questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Undoubtedly, Comcar is far too expensive. That is not the drivers' fault; it is the Minister's fault and a result of his mismanagement. That is what I am trying to get at. To say that the Minister is trying to run a service is probably the under-statement of the year, but the Minister will not explain to the committee, the drivers or the taxi industry what he is trying to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again at Estimates we heard assurances that Comcar will not put on additional vehicles for private sector work. Tonight the Minister has just said that it would be picking up the slack. He cannot explain to us how it is picking up the slack and how it is known when the slack will occur. In Estimates hearings I raised the fact that a Budget minibus with a Comcar banner and driver was seen operating around the Parmelia Hilton Hotel in late August and early September. It was admitted that Comcar quotes at a commercial rate for such services and that buses will be hired if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer given to me at that time was that it was obviously used to carry an entourage from Thailand around. That is fine. There is an answer. But surely once again that is work that could have been done by the private sector. What we are trying to do is get some information. Commonsense would tell us that the use of a bus in this way can only take work from private operators who have to pay registration and licence fees, sales tax on their vehicles, 26c per litre in fuel excise, payroll tax which applies to their cooperative and everything else&mdash;which, incidentally, would all go under Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am trying to find out from the Minister why he continues to pursue this line of trying to take away the business of private sector vehicle operators at this time. We need the private sector to be buoyant and we need to have the private sector employing people; yet we need the security within Comcar. However, we have neither at the moment. Those Comcar drivers do not know whether they have a job from one day to the next, but we still cannot get answers. We have a classic example of a government agency which continually runs at a loss and tries to recoup some of this loss by unfair competition with the private sector. There is far too much anecdotal evidence that undercuts the assurances that were given in the Estimates Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand how the Minister can sit there and quite blindly say that Comcar can continue to run at a loss, which it does year after year. The Minister has that pained expression on his face; he may like to take leave from here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Parer has been through this step by step. I apologise to him, if to no-one else, for taking a few minutes to explain this. Comcar has gone through major restructuring. Comcar has had management consultants from the private sector brought into it. Not only did they do an assessment of Comcar's structure, but also they were kept within the organisation to implement change. That change has meant not only a restructuring of the organisation but also a reduction of some 26 to 29 management positions. It has meant a wholesale new approach to the driving side as well. It has also meant that, as an organisation that was losing a lot of taxpayers' money, through the introduction of changes to the management side, the drivers' side and the technology side, Comcar is now in a position where, within 18 months to just a bit longer than that, we will be turning it around and making a profit without an increase in charges. That is an important aspect of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a fundamental change. It has been a change which those in the Department who have been working on it ought to take a great degree of credit for. It is a change which has meant that, for instance, from the release of the Fightback package in November last year to the time of the next election, we will have achieved some $11.5m in savings to the Commonwealth, when a promise of $10m savings would have been achieved in Fightback. That record is not only a good one but is also one which we can build on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have achieved the savings of Fightback. We have done so with the assistance not only of the public sector organisation that we are talking about but with the best of advice from the private sector. The Australian taxpayer will benefit as a consequence of it. We have also done so without enormous rupture to the organisation and without enormous sackings and with the cooperation of the Transport Workers Union. It is an organisation that will have saved $11.5m by the time of the next election, whenever that might be next year, but growing thereafter. It has outmatched the savings that Dr Hewson might have anticipated in his Fightback package. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will finish on this particular point. We are doing one per cent of our work in the private sector at a time when we are contracting out 19 per cent. So for every dollar we get&mdash;maybe it is not as accurate as this&mdash;maybe we are paying $19 or $20 to the private sector to do the work that Comcar could otherwise be doing if we were to expand the organisation. We are not going to do it. We are going to make the organisation run efficiently. That is what is happening. We will make sure that as the Constitution determines, we will only be doing an incidental proportion of our work in the private sector. </PARA>

Despite all the promises and pledges of the Australian Democrats to the contrary, when Senator McMullan calls them in and says, `It is now time to roll over', they roll over and debate in this place is curtailed again. How can that be consistent with their pledge to the Australian people at every election that they will keep the Government honest? Of course, they are not interested in doing that, because at the end of each session they are put to the test and they join with the Government to guillotine debate in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought the Democrats would have been sufficiently embarrassed by this afternoon's events not to come back for another serve tonight. This afternoon they decided, in the most unusual circumstances, to join with the Government to ensure there was not a Question Time in the chamber. We have been trying to check out the records on that. We have found that, in circumstances where there has not been agreement around the chamber, it has not happened in the last 10 years. In fact, there is some suggestion that it may never have happened. But it certainly happens with this new breed of Democrats when the Australian Labor Party goes to them and says, `Join with us because we do not want a Question Time today'. What does Senator Coulter and his folks say? They say, `We agree; no Question Time today'. When we said this afternoon that we should have the right to debate the most important matter in this nation, the Democrats went to the Labor Party again and said,`We don't wish to debate unemployment today'. We had their spokesperson, Senator Lees on this occasion, get up and say, `We do not want to debate unemployment because we do not think debates in this chamber have actually led to more jobs'. </PARA>

If Senator McMullan says jump, Senator Coulter says, `How high?'. That is a disappointing thing for the Australian people who voted for the Australian Democrats on the last occasion. It is not surprising that when they were last put to the test in the Victorian election a month ago they got about 4 per cent of the vote or less&mdash;a pitiful vote. The Australian people have now realised that they serve no worthwhile purpose in the Australian political process. If ever we were given another demonstration of that, it is tonight. </PARA>

We looked as though we had reached agreement, and at 8 o'clock on the Thursday evening Senator Hill said to me, `Yes, we almost have the times; I will see you in half an hour and we can agree on times'. In half an hour he was not ready. The time went on until about half past 10 or 11 o'clock and, when we negated the adjournment, he said, `All bets are off'; he refused to negotiate any further.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The effort that Senator Kemp made recently has illustrated the role that he has brought to the Senate since his election which seems to concentrate on a criticism of my Party's role in this chamber. The matters of opinion which were proposed by Senator Kemp have very little foundation in fact and make very little contribution on behalf of his electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time that he has been in this chamber, he has become renowned for the emphasis that he places upon critical evaluation of our performance and his lack of contribution, either in substance or subject matter, in his questions during Question Time. He is renowned for either a point of order without substance, which is very seldom upheld, or a question which is addressed to what a Minister or a responsible Minister may think about various things. Questions are not necessarily addressed to policy, to legislation or to a Minister's activities in the portfolio, but rather to a criticism of personalities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I am embarrassed to share this chamber with such a tactician because I cannot see the benefit to those who elected the man. I cannot see the purpose of this attack on people. I wish that we would get a little less of this activity and a lot more which is directed at legislation and substance and which produces the result which the electors of the nation require. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are criticised by this critic for voting for Government legislation occasionally. We believe that there are a lot of things wrong with this country. We believe that things need to be done to address the problems of this nation. We believe that things need to be changed. When legislation is presented to this place, we want to deal with it and change the situation that we are presented with. The way we can do that in this chamber is by looking at legislation and modifying it. We need to deal with the legislation, not the personalities, the opinions or the points of order that do not get substantiated. We should have none of that mumbo jumbo; the legislation is what will change and improve the situation that we have here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot improve the situation without introducing legislation. We cannot improve the faults that we have in front of us in this country without looking at the legislation. To come in here and give us a tirade about what Senator Kemp thinks the Australian Democrats might be doing is such a dishonest waste of time, such an arrogance displayed toward the electorate, that I cannot see why Senator Kemp does not crawl out of here with his tail between his legs every night in utter embarrassment at what he has done in disregarding the will of his electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To come in here and suggest that the Democrats have done a deal with the Government just because we want to see legislation put before the chamber is entirely dishonest because there has been no demonstration, and there cannot be a demonstration, of a deal. There is a blank piece of paper between us; honourable senators can demonstrate no deal. I defy Senator Kemp to come up with any suggestion that there is a deal. If he does, I will donate $10,000 to his re-election campaign. He will never get it; he will not get a jelly bean. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The evidence we can rely on comes from no less a person than Senator Harradine. Senator Harradine, having been here for 17 years now, said that in his assessment of things we would have finished by 3.30 tomorrow afternoon anyhow. I think Senator Harradine has established that this is a very reasonable guillotine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that Senator Bell took Senator Kemp to task. I thought Senator Kemp, in his usual style, put the argument that had to be put to the other side. If I were Senator Bell, I would not take it too seriously. I think that Senator Kemp did what he had to do. He had to put the outrage that the Opposition says it has to have. In fact, it has been a most pleasant debate so far as debates about guillotines go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sorts of onslaughts that Senator Bell and Senator Coulter have suffered tonight have been suffered by the Australian Democrats before. It is not unique. In October 1984, Senator Haines had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am afraid that I had considerable difficulty in taking Senator Chaney's speech any more seriously than on occasions he appeared to be taking it. I cannot understand how any Bill on which there will be 19 speakers can be considered in any way to have been gagged or how democracy can be impugned in any way by closing that debate. Nineteen speakers on the second reading of Appropriation Bills is quite ample.</PARA>
<PARA>The time we have allowed on this occasion is quite ample. Senator Harradine says it is. Nobody on the Opposition side will, I hope, condemn Senator Harradine, who is a most honourable senator&mdash;like we are all most honourable senators. But Senator Harradine has put a time limit on this Bill whereby he says that the debate should be finished within the time that we have allowed. I will quote what Senator Chaney had to say in the 1984 debate. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a few unusual aspects to what is happening this afternoon. I do not wish to put on some sort of mock outrage. However, I remind the Senate that this is not quite the normal circumstance in which a guillotine has been laid down. The difference is that this Senate was scheduled to sit through until December. We have now sat for something like 10 days fewer than the number of days programmed by the Government for consideration of the legislation that it was going to put before this place. The fact is that there is no constitutional or legal reason why we should be lifting tomorrow. The view of the Opposition is that we need more time to consider the substantial legislation which is still before the Senate. The fact is there is no constitutional or legal reason for lifting the Senate tomorrow night. There is no more than a campaigning reason.</PARA>

After all, this is the Senate chamber; they are elected to the Senate in accordance with the Constitution. It is not the Democrats who are imposing this guillotine; it is the majority of the Senate. I invite honourable senators to respect the dignity of this chamber. I hope that when the vote is passed and honourable senators have ample time in which to debate the Appropriations in accordance with what Senator Harradine has said, they will graciously go and tell the Democrats that this was really just part of the debate and that they really love them deeply and sincerely as they believe that they contribute considerably to this chamber. </PARA>

One relates to Australian National Railways returning containers from east to west. It has a high freight volume from east to west, but coming from west to east there is an excess capacity. For freight in that direction it cuts the rate by 80 per cent at least. This results in a distortion of the road transport system.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. It is fairly difficult to operate when one gets one set of tables and two or three weeks later another set of tables. I remind the Minister that when we wanted to change one word in the Bill we were told that this would mean millions of dollars and that the Government was not able to do it. We were told that there would be all these savings and that this was the reason the Government had to extend the use of the tax file number.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating, when he was Treasurer, told us that when the Government instituted the tax file number it would be used for taxation purposes only.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, we were told that the original savings estimate of income from Social Security for the retired would be $162m. I do not have the correct figure from the report which was tabled in the Senate, but it was about a third or so less. The same thing happened with income from Social Security for people with disabilities and sickness. We will not get the same savings there. I want to know why we were told the first time, with the first data matching report, not enough cycles had been done to make the savings. That is not an excuse this time. We agreed in this chamber to have people's freedoms and privacy infringed yet again, given that we were told these savings were to be made, but we now find that the actual savings are nowhere near the savings that the Government claimed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All right. In terms of the savings now, the data matching program, as Senator Patterson knows, has been in effect now for a short time. The Government's position is that the program is proving to be effective in the detection of fraud and incorrect payments, although, as she rightly says, the savings are not as high as originally estimated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of that, a number of points need to be noted. There are three main reasons why savings from data matching have been less than estimated. First, the measure was implemented later than expected, owing to the need for a thorough consultation between agencies and the Privacy Commissioner to protect those understandable concerns about privacy and natural justice. So those processes were followed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept of data matching has developed over the years. I was the person who initially tossed it into the public debate as an alternative to the Australia Card. I believed then that it was an appropriate alternative to an intrusive system. But the Government, in implementing our programs, has been concerned to ensure that the processes with the Privacy Commissioner have been thorough and meaningful. As a consequence, the measure was introduced later than expected, partly because of those processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason why the savings are not as much as had been planned is that a significant part of the program depends on the acquisition and use of tax file numbers. Collecting the millions of tax file numbers has been a huge task. That has taken longer than anticipated. Again, great efforts have been made to explain to clients why they are needed and how they will used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third aspect which should be kept in mind when making an assessment of the program is that the Department's overnight check of new claims through accelerated claimant matching is proving to be more successful than expected. This means that discrepancies are being identified earlier&mdash;at the time of grant rather than later on through data matching. In 1991-92, for instance, ACM savings totalled some $142.969m, reported in the data matching report as $143m. This was $88.4m more than the original estimate of $54.6m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This ACM initiative will be extended to all offices in 1992-93. We anticipate that it should result in 1,200 cancellations or variations, with additional net program savings of almost $9m. They are three reasons, probably amongst a number of others, why the estimates have not been achieved. I think it is fair to place on the public record that the process has been quite useful and productive. It has been implemented in consultation with the Privacy Commissioner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even if the Minister is satisfied with those explanations, I am not. The savings are less than half what he predicted. I sat through those meetings of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs when we were told that they were not guesstimates but `We know that these are the savings we are going to get'. I kept arguing that some of the figures were very rubbery and that it was unlikely that those savings would be made. We see this happening over and over again. We have seen it happen with the Health Insurance Commission.

For instance, if one were to hold onto one's shares for a few extra months and the price of those shares was to go up over that period, obviously there would be a different assessment. If the price were to go down, I presume there would also be a different assessment.

As I say, although the figures in isolation may look unacceptable, they are not as high as in some other organisations.

I would have expected him to give me some other managerial answer as to how he is going to reduce sick leave amongst DSS officers. Obviously there are a number of other issues about why people take sick leave other than that they are rorting the system. It may also mean that some of the Minister's officers are under a great deal of stress because of the unprecedented unemployment levels and the number of demands that are being made on Social Security officers. I would have thought that getting the unemployment levels down and having a plan of action, such as the coalition has, would reduce stress on DSS officers. But no, the Minister cannot think of anything else, except some bureaucratic answer telling me that they are going to fill out more forms. That is typical of the Minister and his Government.

The Department checked the financial costing, probably more than any other aspect of the proposal.

I was told in the Estimates Committee that I was not able to get a list of those people because of the privacy aspects of the Health Act. That was absolute nonsense. It was the same sort of garbage that the Minister is giving me now.</PARA></TALK.START>

When Senator Tate felt that I had sufficient information to indicate that there were problems with those lists, he gave me that list in confidence. Senator Zakharov is sitting on the opposite side of the chamber. She knows that I was given that list as a member of that Committee.

During the Estimates hearings I raised the issue of Australian taxpayers funding legal expenses for Iranian nationals.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, there are several elements to Senator Calvert's question, which concerns the provision of legal aid to enable certain persons charged with serious offences in relation to the attack on the Iranian Embassy to obtain representation so that counsel could be provided in the committal proceedings, which I think were concluded a couple of days ago, with 13 defendants being committed for trial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I have explained before that, of the 13 charged in relation to the incident, five were denied legal aid. That means that eight were provided with legal aid. The five being denied legal aid were, of course, denied legal aid on various bases, but included amongst them would have been a sufficiency of assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the eight who were left qualified to receive legal aid, they were citizens or lawful residents; they had permanent residence. I need to just emphasise that because in some popular imagination there is some image of those charged being persons who had just flown in to create this incident, about which I do not want to say a great deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the eight who were left qualified and who were assessed as fulfilling the criteria to enable them to receive legal aid from the Australian Capital Territory Legal Aid Commission were citizens or lawful residents. By definition, in order to qualify for legal aid, they have to have a very low capacity to fund their own legal representation. So the normal rules would have been applied by the Australian Capital Territory Legal Aid Commission to their income and assets. The threshold is such that one has to be really very poor indeed these days to qualify for legal aid from the point of view of means. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not quite sure of the answer to that. It may vary from commission to commission. We are now in a difficult transition situation where the High Court, the highest judicial tribunal in Australia, ruled only two days ago that there is a common law right to a fair trial. Included in that common law right is the notion that if a person is faced with the prospect of being convicted for a serious offence, which I guess is judged by the sort of penalty that might be imposed if the conviction were secured by the prosecution, if a guilty verdict were obtained, then the judge ought to consider whether that person needs to be represented. If that person is not represented, a magistrate has been invited by the High Court to consider adjourning the matter. In other words, the prosecution cannot proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implication from that decision of the High Court&mdash;as I say, brought down only two days ago&mdash;would be that a person, whatever his background, if faced with a criminal trial for a serious offence, would be in a situation where the High Court ruling would oblige the judge to consider whether a fair trial requires representation. In many situations, that would involve representation through an arrangement made by the relevant legal aid commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can get the exact details of the current practice, but it will have to change. Legal aid commissions around Australia have been alerted to this High Court decision. My best inference from the decision would be that any person facing a serious charge has a right to a fair trial in so far as that includes representation. If the person cannot afford that representation, it is likely that the matter would be adjourned until the representation is provided, no doubt at public expense, through a legal aid commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the original estimate was up to $1m. Given that we are such a generous nation and given the reasons the Minister has advanced this morning why we should provide legal aid, it is very hard for me to explain the position to people who come into my office on an almost weekly basis and say they have been denied legal aid because they happen to own a house. These people come from places such as Glenorchy and Chigwell. They are having problems getting legal aid for family settlements and the like. I do not think it is of any benefit to them to realise that eight people, who, as the Minister pointed out, are lawful residents of Australia&mdash;certainly they came from overseas not all that long ago&mdash;are going to receive up to $1m.</PARA></TALK.START>

So on top of the estimated $1m that the defendants will get in legal aid, the Government is going to be very generous and cough up another half a million dollars. This raises a few other matters. Where is the money coming from? Is this an admission of guilt on behalf of the Federal Government for the lack of security at the Iranian Embassy?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of security at the Embassy has already been dealt with in various forums of the Senate. I will explain how the ordinary operations of legal aid commissions, in order to fund precisely the sorts of cases that come to honourable senators on a constituency basis, are preserved by Federal Government arrangements. If the Legal Aid Commission in the ACT had been faced with catastrophic costs from a major criminal trial, it would been bankrupted and would have been stripped of the funds that would otherwise have been used for referrals in perhaps the equivalent of many hundreds of cases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where there is such a major funding problem confronting a legal aid commission, we would require the commission to pay, I think, 5 per cent of the prospective costs, or $100,000 in the case of the ACT, whichever is the less, and we make up the balance. We do so precisely to enable the legal aid commissions to keep their funds intact for the many hundreds, if not thousands, of cases which we are all very familiar with and which are very deserving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACT Legal Aid Commission applied the normal criteria to decide on the eligibility of those who allegedly were involved in this incident at the Iranian Embassy. The costs, in prospect, were enormous. The Federal Government applied this particular new arrangement and has come in to assist in the funding.

It says Geneva, London and Paris. It is really not good enough, is it? The travel allowance for one of those trips was in the vicinity of $12,000 and the other was roughly the same. So, about half of the Commissioner's travelling allowance was taken up by overseas travel. It is just not good enough to say that he was attending meetings of the such and such committee.

That would be of some assistance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some comments quickly about Auscript and see what the Minister has to say in terms of clarifying for me exactly where Auscript is heading. Auscript cost the taxpayer $6.8m in the last financial year, and will cost the taxpayer $4.3m in 1992-1993. I think it is the time to ask about the question of fairness of the subsidisation of a service that apparently engages in predatory pricing against its private sector competitors, yet delivers a service at far greater cost than is produced by private court reporting services. I want to know how the Minister can justify this along the lines of the same issue that was raised with Comcar. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of the Committee to particular answers that I obtained to a series of questions with regard to Auscript. These related to billable hours and total pages transcribed over 1991-92, and to revenue and expenditure for that year. When the market rate of $25 per hour is applied to 68,193 billable hours, we get a total $1.7m. But applying the market rate of $7 per page to 767,966 pages results in a total of $5.4m. Thus, in the absence of Auscript, the commercial sector could have done the same work at a cost of $7.1m. Instead, actual revenue obtained by Auscript was $12.6m&mdash;an excess of $5.5m that can only suggest that Auscript is benefiting from a clientele that is still locked in and is certainly unable to benefit from market rates. When the figure of expenditure of $19.5m is considered, it can be said that the workload of Auscript cost an extra $12.4m. I would like to know from the Minister how he can possibly justify that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is surprising that an answer to my question as to an average cost per page of transcript could not be supplied. But it has been made clear, in the answers to my questions on notice and in the answers given by Auscript, that as a government agency it operates under significantly different conditions than its private sector competitors. I ask the Minister, if Auscript is going to compete in the private sector, why that should be. Auscript is, of course, free of the requirement to pay sales tax, payroll tax, company tax and fees to the ASC. In the last two financial years, it has received capital grants of $3.9m from the taxpayer for its commercial establishment&mdash;grants that it is not required to repay. The private sector would be laughed at if it asked for a grant of $3.9m from the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department told the Estimates Committee on 10 September that Auscript makes a payment to Comcare that is equivalent to a workers compensation payment, but went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I make no suggestion as to how it might relate to a commercial organisation's premium.</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose that that is exactly right. Auscript certainly comes from a different world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, we were told that Auscript requires a $2.5m direct subsidy as the net difference for the cost disadvantage caused by operating in the government sector. Pretty weak examples of superannuation costing Auscript $775,000 in higher rentals are cited. I can only say that claims of disadvantage do not impress the commercial court reporters, who have to operate under the ultimate sanction&mdash;either you pay or go out of business. For example, in Western Australia, a private company has been beaten to a tender by Auscript by one dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are getting beyond the stage of reality. On the one hand, the answers to questions show only too well that the Australian taxpayer would get better value for money if Auscript were scrapped and all services were contracted to the private sector. But, on the other hand, it is clear that Auscript is using inflated revenue from its government clients and its protected position to engage in predatory competition with the commercial sector. I would like the Minister to explain to me why that is fair. I still relate it to the Comcar case, because it is very similar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is stated that non-government clients are being targeted, and we can see the results of an expenditure of $424,000 in marketing for 1991-92. How can the Government justify spending nearly half a million dollars on marketing when the private companies would obviously not be able to do that and have to charge more? Some of this marketing would seem to take the form of approaching the client of a commercial firm and offering to perform, as I mentioned before, the same service for $1 per page less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the revenue figures per volume of work, we can only conclude that Auscript is charging such rates at as much as one-third of the average costs. It is ironic that this Government has now instituted the independent inquiry into competition policy to resist anti-competitive conduct that `should apply to all market participants, regardless of the form of business ownership'. One of its own agencies is clearly violating this principle. I hope that such matters are pursued vigorously by the Hilmer Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to be suspicious of the switch by the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption to Auscript because it offered a `significantly cheaper tender than Spark and Cannon'. The normal practice was not followed and details of the tender were not released to its unsuccessful rival. I ask the Minister why. What is Auscript trying to hide? Let us face it, Auscript remains a government agency supported by the taxpayers' money. The figures prove that we are not getting value for money. We should not be giving a public agency support to enable it to undercut the commercial private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have raised a number of issues that are of great concern to the private sector. I certainly seek the Minister's answer as to what it can expect in the future. Will this predatory pricing continue? What sort of subsidy will Auscript get from the Government in the months ahead?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to be extremely careful about some of the allegations made by Senator Knowles. I am not in a position, and I do not know that Senator Knowles is, to speak of what prices might have been offered or what tenders might have been put in by Auscript in competition with other providers of such services, or to know whether the claim about predatory pricing could be justified. It needs to be pointed out that the Trade Practices Commission jurisdiction applies to Commonwealth agencies such as Auscript. So if it has indulged in predatory pricing or if those in the marketplace consider that those sorts of practices have been engaged in to their detriment, without wanting to encourage any particular course of action, I point out to those people that there is a proper avenue to pursue that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe very strongly that Auscript ought to be very conscious of its obligation to refrain from predatory pricing, not as a matter of goodwill or charity to others in the marketplace but as a matter of law. This Parliament says in the Trade Practices Act that, in this case, this Commonwealth agency shall not engage in predatory pricing. I would be very anxious to ensure that that law is adhered to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a bit of quid pro quo in this whole matter.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During Estimates hearings, Senator Newman put a number of questions on notice. In answer to one of the questions, on page E213, `Why has the Department been unable to supply a leg which satisfies the needs of Mr Fleming?', the Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department has gone to exceptional lengths to assist Mr Fleming.</PARA>
<PARA>He also stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most recent example was at the Central Development Unit in Melbourne on 8 May 1992 when a socket was made which, in the opinion of the CDU staff and the specialist involved, fitted properly.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to ask why Mr Ashford, in a letter to Mr Fleming of 24 June, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have therefore decided that the only solution for you is to take the limb to Hobart RALAC where the staff can make any reasonable adjustment. However I have instructed the manager that he will not be permitted to spend unlimited time on your case.</PARA>
<PARA>I can accept all of that, but why was Mr Fleming referred to Hobart when the Repatriation Hospital Heidelberg documents dated 8 May show that the patient was to be advised as to future appointments at CDU in Melbourne to further pursue the socket work. It was also referred to again in another document of 4 June from the Royal Hobart Hospital. The document states: `further treatment if necessary to be advised re the Melbourne appointment'. The `exceptional lengths' that were gone to in CDU in Melbourne on 8 May to fit Mr Fleming with an above-knee prosthesis, to me anyway, do not seem to be followed up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter was referred to Hobart and Mr Fleming in fact believes that the attention he would get there would not be the same as that which could be supplied at CDU in Melbourne.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a complicated case. It is always difficult when a highly personal matter such as this is dealt with as it involves medical assessments and elements quite apart from the question of the way in which the artificial limbs scheme might be responding as a professional service to the requests of a particular person who, I think all senators who have been involved in this matter would agree, has received many, many hours of attention over many years in order to try to fit him with a limb which would be satisfactory to his requirements, which are expressed by him in conversations with all of us as being at the outer limits perhaps of technology and of the work which he wants to be able to undertake while wearing such a limb.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever the history, which has been so complicated, the fact is that it is not simply a question of being referred, if you like, to the repatriation hospital in Hobart. As I understand it, the latest offer to Mr Fleming by way of a letter to him on 26 August was to send Dr Fahrer, who is said to be a world renowned specialist in this field. It has been put to Mr Fleming that he should attend in Hobart for a day with Dr Fahrer and Dr Heddle and that there be a joint medical assessment made. They believe that Mr Fleming ought to be examined again before a decision can be taken on his future treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly have put to Mr Fleming that, whatever his misgivings or concerns or fears or scepticism about the process, surely after all these years and with all the difficulties, submitting himself for a day to this particular examination could only aid and assist his case and would not be a great frustration or hindrance or impediment to his making further progress. But until that particular consultation is undertaken, then I think it is fair that the artificial limbs scheme be able to say quite properly that it has done as much as it is able to do to this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the best advice to Mr Fleming, which certainly I offered in my office when he came to see me, was that he should undertake this day's reassessment even if it might be, from his point of view, pointless, and take it from there.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having observed Mr Fleming, I guess one would have to sympathise with him. As the Minister is a person who has suffered himself, not with a prosthesis but with a hip injury, and he knows the pain involved, surely he can understand the frustration of a person who has had a limb that has fitted him and been very good and now, for reasons that the Minister has stated and other reasons that I have documented evidence of here, it seems he cannot get the attention he requires.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked a question during Estimates hearings&mdash;that is how I got involved&mdash;about whether we in Australia were up to world standard with our supply of artificial limbs. The answer I got was: `We are confident that the standard is high'. I would have to query that as a result of the huge amount of documentation I have been given since and changes that have been made in the world scene. I have seen prostheses advertised in the USA which enable amputees to play basketball and racketball; Edward Kennedy's son can walk around on limbs that seem to be much more effective than the ones available in Australia; even a high wire artist has an artificial limb and can walk a high wire with an artificial limb.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that sort of technology is available in Australia. Even if it were, the major problem with Mr Fleming, it seems, is that he cannot get a decent fit for his socket. The latest socketry CAT-CAM is not available in Australia. When are we going to catch up? What are we trying to do to acquaint ourselves with this latest technology? I know for a fact that this American company, which is so up-to-date with this technology, has offered to make Mr Fleming&mdash;I have a fax here which I can provide to the Department&mdash;a $US20,000 limb for the price of a normal limb in Australia. He is, as honourable senators can imagine, rather frustrated&mdash;or perhaps he may even be rather excited that the offer has been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting back to the questions I asked, do we really have world-class prosthesis available in Australia? Are there a lot of people out there disabled at the moment who believe they have good limbs and do not realise that there is far better technology available? I would like to, if I may, table this other letter that I have from Mr Thomas Guth, who I am sure the Minister's advisers would be aware of. He is one of the top prosthetists in the world and has, as I said, made this offer to Mr Fleming for an up-to-date, above-the-knee prosthesis that is world-class for the price of one that is available here in Australia. I guess that might be creating a precedent, but I would like to at least put that on the record. It may be something that the Department should consider. </PARA>

I believe that any patient, even one as difficult, sometimes, as Mr Fleming, should have the right of recourse.

If further treatment is indicated at the CDU in Melbourne then, as I understand it, all that is being requested of him is that he undertakes to abide by the professional advice that is offered to him and the professional regime of a mixture of physiotherapy and the way in which the prosthesis has to work properly without interference to the technical operation of that particular artificial limb. In other words, if he is provided with this particular service, he should agree to go along with the professional advisers who are amongst the best, certainly the best in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

I will be following this matter through with the Department. I can understand the problems of the Department and the Minister with the frustration of this particular patient, but in the interests of this person and others throughout Australia, who have disabilities, I believe it is important that this offer that is made to him for a subsidised limb from the United States which is of the latest technology is something that certainly should be looked at.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Estimates Committee E hearing on this issue of the disposal of the Mitchell bomber and was astonished at the incorrect information that was given to the Committee by the witness Dr McKernan. He said in evidence:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as the B25 Mitchell bomber was a lightly used aircraft by the RAAF in the Second World War, the decision was taken by Council, and then referred on to the Minister . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Over the page he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, not significantly. The type we have was used very   infrequently   by Australians&mdash;by   the RAAF . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is not true. The RAAF operated two Mitchell squadrons. I think No. 22 was one of the RAAF squadrons. Certainly No. 18 squadron was a RAAF squadron which was manned mainly by Dutch personnel from what was then the Dutch East Indies. The Mitchell was an aircraft that had a significant role in the order of battle. When we talk about a war memorial, we do not necessarily talk about items of equipment of historical significance which were necessarily used by one of the arms of the Australian defence forces&mdash;the Army, the Navy or the Air Force. We do talk about equipment which was of relevance to the combined arms. It would be difficult to think of an aircraft in the Pacific campaign which was more important to the Australian Army&mdash;the AIF and the AMF&mdash;in the campaigns in New Guinea, than the Mitchell in the bombing role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three dominant aircraft would have to have been the P40, the fighter, operated principally by the RAAF; the Lightning, operated by the USAF; and the Mitchell, in the strike or bombing role&mdash;it was the dominant aircraft and is of great historical significance. It was also highly significant to the divisions that were in the North African campaign in the earlier part of the war, before those divisions were brought back to Australia. It was also important in New Guinea. To say that the B25 was not a significant aircraft in Australia's history in the Second World War is to make a statement of great ignorance. I do not know anything about Dr McKernan&mdash;I have never met him&mdash;but the statement that he made that it was an insignificant aircraft with respect to Australia's military history is grossly incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that Senator Newman was clearly making before the Committee was that we cannot sell items of great significance. Senator Newman, quite correctly, drew attention to the obvious deficiencies in the acquisitions policy of the Australian War Memorial. It is quite proper where there are a number of items in a collection to trade or sell them to add to other items for which there is a priority need. In this case, that aeroplane has great significance to Australia's effort in the Pacific. There is no way on earth that any responsible body could move to sell it, particularly when it was acquired at such low cost and low effort by the museum initially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great deal of volunteer effort went into preparing that aeroplane for flight in the United States&mdash;making it airworthy, bringing it out here and then handing it over in airworthy condition to the museum. While I do not believe there is anything in writing in the way of a contractual obligation, there certainly was a clear understanding that that aircraft would never be sold. I am appalled at the action of the museum in putting this aircraft up for tender. I do not believe there is much in the War Memorial's collection that should ever go out for tender. I could agree with items being swapped for things of a higher priority, but I believe the museum, and the Council&mdash;if it is blamed, as Dr McKernan seems to do in his evidence&mdash;have behaved in a grossly irresponsible way. </PARA>

Bill Hayden. Dr Edwards's initial appointment was to the then level of second division officer level 2, which now equates to the upper SES band 1 level. The original conditions of Dr Edwards's appointment specified a midterm review of his level. This review was undertaken in 1987. Dr Edwards was consequently reclassified, with effect from 1 November 1987, to SES level 3, which presently equates to a lower SES band 2 position. Dr Edwards was reappointed to the position of Official Historian for five years from 20 February 1990.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night in the debate on Estimates Committee D on Social Security, I was subjected to a totally inappropriate personal attack by Minister Bolkus. I think that was precipitated by his reluctance and the inappropriate way in which he did not answer my questions as compared with the way in which we dealt with the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services in the Estimates procedure. If the records were looked at, they would reveal that on previous occasions it has taken something like 20 or more hours in the committee stage of Estimates. In fact, during the last Estimates we put a large number of questions on notice. I know that placed an undue strain on the departmental officers, but it reduced the time we spent in Estimates by almost half.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put on the public record my appreciation to the Minister responsible, Senator Tate, and also to the officers who responded with answers to those questions.

The answers were dealt with by one of his staff members, who then conveyed the information to the Department which answered those questions.

He asked whether a person travelling to Australia with travel insurance ought not be treated in Australia as if that person had personal health insurance: for example, when Australians who currently have private health insurance go to a doctor or a hospital and are asked whether they have private health insurance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The short answer is that these are a series of reciprocal arrangements which, indeed, provide great benefits for Australians who travel to the countries concerned, whether one is talking of the United Kingdom, Italy, Malta, Sweden, the Netherlands or New Zealand. In other words, if one visits those countries and has an episode of ill health, an accident or some trauma, then one is entitled, as an Australian in those countries, to have access to the host country's public health care system. In so far as that is reciprocated, that is exactly what it is: a recognition that, whilst costs would be borne by the Australian community in providing that benefit&mdash;that access to the public health system to visitors from those countries&mdash;Australians benefit when they are in a similar situation of some jeopardy in those countries.

The Opposition is proposing to add compulsory private health insurance to the tax contributions and the Medicare levy contributions of Australians to our health care system. Under the Fightback package, every individual and every household in Australia would have to add to the tax and Medicare levy contributions they make to our health care system the payment of a premium to a private health insurance agency of some sort or another.

The answer is very clear: it will come from the public hospital system. The Opposition is, for example, intending to strip 5 per cent off the funds available to all the States. The States, of course, need those funds in order to fund, amongst other things, their hospital systems, their education and roads and many other services they provide.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put on the public record that during the Estimates hearings I asked questions about an inquiry that was undertaken by the Department into the health insurance funds. I believe 57 of them received letters demanding within 14 days full details of payments made by them during the past year to various lobby groups and whether the funds were using such groups for political purposes. During the Estimates inquiry it was revealed, and it was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 14 August, that a spokesman of the Department said,`There were concerns that some insurers were involved in the undesirable practice of using members' money for political campaigns'. This witch-hunt went on. During Estimates we discovered that it was one person. One person had gone to a departmental officer. Obviously the delegation of power was such that it did not require ministerial approval for this witch-hunt to be undertaken. One departmental officer investigated all these health funds, asking for details about all their expenditure to ensure that they had not spent any of their members' money for political purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who was that member? None other than George Gear; none other than Mr Gear. He set up this witch-hunt, he went to somebody in the Department, and he asked for this information. We all know Mr Gear's views about health and nationalising medicine.

I think it should be on the public record that one person can go to the Department and have an inquiry&mdash;I do not know whether it was right in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>&mdash;but the spokesman said there were concerns expressed by one person. I think it is appalling that all those health insurance companies were investigated in that way without the Minister giving his approval, I presume, for that officer to make that inquiry. I think the public should know that that is the sort of thing that goes on and that is the way their money is spent; and that is the way their organisations, to which they belong, are investigated by this Government with very little information from somebody who has such a prejudiced view about health and how health ought to be run. </PARA>

As to the first question on new jobs, the criterion for the councils when they make their applications is that local economic activity be generated. As at 1 p.m. on 16 November, which was yesterday, $52.2m had been spent. That is a more rapid take-up than was anticipated at the time of the Budget.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I begin the specific questions I have for the Minister, I would like to express my dismay at the progress of Estimates Committee F in relation to the Department of Employment, Education and Training. At this moment I have not received answers to over half the questions which I placed on notice before the Department. If I do not have the answers to questions in the Estimates Committee, I cannot follow up the important issues, as is the right of every senator as part of the function of review. The answers that I am still waiting on cover a very wide range of departmental programs. They include all questions on general recurrent funding, schools, national priorities for schools, questions relating to the Australian National University, the University of Southern Queensland, the University of Canberra, the Australian Research Council, Aboriginal employment and training, Austudy, Abstudy, management services and youth affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Minister will agree that many of these areas are of particular significance to the community. They are major Budget items and are of significance to the current economic climate, and the public is entitled to know whether the money is being well spent. They are particularly significant in view of the fact that the Department of Employment, Education and Training has one of the poorest records of financial management in the Federal Public Service. This is the Department whose financial accounts for last year were heavily qualified by the Auditor-General. Time and again, on specific project audit, the Auditor-General has made severe criticisms and wide ranging recommendations. Usually the recommendations have been poorly followed up, and this has been the case from year to year. It is a mega-department and now it is too big, and so the Department needs very careful scrutiny and review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, however, this review cannot be properly undertaken before the Appropriation Bills are passed because we do not have answers to very important questions. A large part of the blame we lay at the feet of the responsible Minister. The hearing did not actually take place until 21 October 1992, a delay of four weeks. The Committee was continually delayed because the Government could not provide a Minister to attend the Committee. Finally, the only date available was 21 October, and then we did not have the Minister normally responsible for DEET but we had the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), who spent most of his time doing his homework out of a series of blue folders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, this Government is contemptuous of the review processes of the Senate. The Committee meeting was held four weeks ago and it is not surprising that the Department has not answered all the questions on notice, given that there were hundreds. Nevertheless, after a period of four weeks, we would expect the reply rate from the Department to be higher than 50 per cent, particularly on the many important programs that were covered. This makes a farce of the procedures of the Senate and severely curtails our review function. Given this situation, I ask the Minister to give an undertaking that all questions on notice that are currently unanswered will be answered by 1 December 1992. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have heard most of what Senator Tierney has had to say. He would be aware, as I am sure other senators are aware, that the original hearing for the estimates of the Department of Employment, Education and Training was scheduled for an earlier time than it was actually held. The reason why the hearing at the earlier time did not proceed was that the hearings of preceding portfolios took longer than the program managers anticipated and drove us into the wee small hours of the mornings on those days. That put us in a position of clearly not being able to do justice to the consideration of a portfolio as important and as central to Government policy as the portfolio of Employment, Education and Training, so a time was set at which most members of the Committee were available to devote a full day to those hearings. But, alas and alack, the demands of other members of the Senate Estimates Committee to pursue issues in the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio even intruded into part of that time, limiting it. That is not a fault of the Government, that is a fault of how the program unfolded. Perhaps if I were being unkind&mdash;which I will not be&mdash;I could say it was filibustered, but I do not think that is a fair description.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It came close, but I do not think it is a fair description of it if one is precise about what the circumstances were. But I do not think it is fair, either, to then say that the Government has not enabled proper scrutiny because the times were truncated by virtue of the way in which the events took place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next matter was the number of questions that were asked when the portfolio came on for scrutiny. The number of questions on notice asked before the hearing was 88. The number of questions asked during the hearing which required information to be obtained which was not available to the officers appearing before the Committee was 49. All up, a total of 137 questions were asked. Of those questions that were asked, some 50 per cent have been answered. The problem about dealing with numbers and percentages is that it does not go to the complications about obtaining an accurate, fully checked answer in each case. I think there is common and fair accord between us that some of those questions involved quite considerable coordination across various sections and divisions within the Department in order to get together the information from which an answer can be given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised by departmental officers that they expect to have answers to 89 per cent of all the questions that have been either put on notice or asked directly in the committee proceedings in the possession of the Committee by the end of next week. The remaining 11 per cent of questions will take a little longer than that, because of the difficulty about obtaining the information. These are answers to questions where the information does not sit neatly and discretely in a pigeonhole somewhere so that it can be plucked out and put down, but needs a lot of coordination. With the glut of questions that have been before the Department, obviously there is a question of trying to do the right thing; but the more complicated and complex the research needed in order to answer those questions, the longer it takes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in answer directly to Senator Tierney's question to me today, I give an undertaking that by 1 December there will be an answer to all of the questions. I can answer now that it is my expectation that 89 per cent of the questions will be answered in a week or so, and certainly by that date. The Department is pursuing the target of trying to answer all of those questions as quickly as possible in all the reasonable circumstances. I do not think I can fairly say now that all answers will be in and available by the date specified, although I am assured by the Department that they will be in and available as soon as possible and within a reasonable time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the comments of my colleague Senator Tierney, and I intend to do so very quickly and as precisely as possible. I also want to bring to the notice of the chamber the fact that we are left with one hour and 45 minutes to consider the report of Estimates Committee F, which covers the portfolios of Employment, Education and Training, including ATSIC; Industrial Relations; and Primary Industries and Energy. I think that what the Government has done, in collusion with the Democrats, is absolutely outrageous. When the Government's total outlays for 12 months are in the order of $110 billion, to guillotine the examination of that expenditure is absolutely outrageous. There are other words that I can think of but I should not use them in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister quite correctly said, the scheduled hearings of the estimates for DEET were put back, but I point out that some of the most important information that we required to present questions was received either on the day before those hearings or on the day of the hearings. I refer particularly to paragraph 5 of the Committee's report. I will not go into it in detail because of the limitation of time. However, it would be interesting to know whether, if the hearing had been held on the date originally scheduled for it, the information would have been available at that time. If so, the question could be asked: why was it not given to us at that time and not held back until we actually got to the hearings?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make one point about what the Minister just said with regard to the additional time that was taken to consider the estimates for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. We agreed between us&mdash;I acknowledge the efforts of Senator Beahan&mdash;that we would start an hour early to facilitate the additional questioning that was required for Primary Industries and Energy, which was in relation to AQIS. In fact, we did start an hour earlier and I think we used 15 minutes of the time allocated to DEET. The point that the Minister did not mention was that we also finished an hour earlier than anticipated because, as Senator Tierney has already pointed out, the Minister who was with us that day, Senator Button, had to leave an hour early. That took an hour off our time. I want to emphasise that many of those questions could not have been asked prior to that time because we did not have all the information that we required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also refer to paragraph 9 of the report to the Senate by Estimates Committee F, which deals with training and management, management skills, and a committee chaired by Mr David Karpin. I bring that to the attention of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have two further comments to make. I highlight what I term the mismanagement of the Department in relation to the increase in its administration costs. It is worth noting that they are growing at a significantly faster rate than the delivery of services. In the current situation one would have thought the reverse would apply because of the extra demands on the Department through DEET. In looking at those we find that running costs, other than outlays, increased by 20.43 per cent and total outlays increased by 17.4 per cent. That highlights the point that I wished to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I wish to make is that there are incomplete program performance statements requiring supplementary derivation tables. In making that particular point, the other one I make is that there were movements from one program to another in terms of expenditure and funding. While we were told that that was to do with modernising&mdash;I guess that is the right word&mdash;the presentation of the reports, there was no way, from looking at them, in which one could identify the changes that had been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude these opening comments by summarising my points. Firstly, the time given was totally inadequate for us to scrutinise DEET properly&mdash;hence, the huge number of questions which were put on notice. Secondly, at a time when we have record and unacceptable levels of unemployment because of the mismanagement of this Government, we find ourselves being left with probably about 45 minutes to deal with this whole program here in the chamber today. It does no credit to the Government, nor the Democrats, for gagging this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With regard to schools, program 1, I raise the fact that the total outlays for this division increased from $2,634m to $2,790m between 1991 and 1993. Administration costs increased from $10.75m in 1991 to $11.9m in 1991-92 and $14.21m in 1992-93, a rise of 32 per cent over two years and 18.6 per cent this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a significant increase in expenditure, and it begs the question, which will come up later on in these hearings, as to why, in terms of the delivery of services through DEET and schools, in particular, that could not have been addressed rather than putting in place ANTA, which will become once again a liability, I believe, on taxpayers because two similar programs or situations will be running alongside one another. Of course, the introduction of ANTA really highlights the fact that the Government&mdash;Mr Beazley, in particular&mdash;is showing a lack of confidence in the Department. It should have been addressed within the Department and within TAFE rather than increasing, as I have already said, the administration costs here and setting up what will be an entirely new bureaucracy, which we will deal with in a moment or two. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a couple of issues with the Minister on this particular program with regard to vocational education and training systems. In particular, I ask him to address the issue of the establishment of the Australian National Training Authority, or ANTA, which is separate from DEET. As honourable senators would be aware, DEET is administered through the States. I note that, in terms of the operations of ANTA, it appears to be replacing a number of the functions of DEET.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister: why was it necessary, firstly, to put in place another bureaucratic structure? Secondly, in view of the fact that it will be replacing a number of functions of DEET, is it the intention of the Government in the medium term to withdraw funding from the States for the operations of TAFE?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, the Australian National Training Authority is a body that has been negotiated between the Commonwealth and the States to oversee the provision of funding and services to the technical and further education area. ANTA arose as a consequence of our commitment as a government to enhancing technical and further education in Australia by an amount, as I recall, in the One Nation statement of about $72m. The purpose of that was to provide training for skill and training in the technical areas to match the commitment that we have given to the more academic stream through universities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because TAFEs are under State jurisdiction, what had occurred over the years was that, by comparison, each State operating its own particular TAFEs in its own way had not allowed them to grow in a manner equivalent to the needs of industry and of the community. They had not grown in a way which we, as the Federal Government, thought was healthy for the balance of skills in the economy. That situation required an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, because we are not in the business of funding schemes that do not deliver the goods just so that the State jurisdictions can prosper. It is the delivery of the goods that is the important thing, not how much funding a particular State captures. Therefore, we have national standards. ANTA was set up to help draw all parts of Australia into a proper national structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that that was something that even the most States rightist advocates in education would think was a good thing. The fact that States of all political stripes have joined with the Commonwealth to set national standards and to work in this way is a positive development in a federation such as Australia. So I do not see ANTA, as the honourable senator depicted it in his question, as yet another bureaucratic structure. It does not exist to perpetuate a bureaucracy but, in fact, to meet a real national need and to provide a comprehensive and coherent mechanism to service that need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable senator's second question, as I took it down, was: since this will replace a number of DEET functions, does this mean that there will be less money available for TAFE? I will need to check with my advisers about the precise terms I should use in answering that question, in order to ensure its accuracy. However, my understanding is that there are more funds available to the TAFE system because of the commitment of the Federal Government to improving technical and vocational education in this country. The Government is particularly keen to make it available to young Australians who are out of the school system but who are still in search of training and skills for occupational needs. Much more funding is available for those requirements. However, whether that means that there is less funding available to supplement bureaucratic back-up at State level, I am not sure. I will ascertain that answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that ANTA will be established as a Commonwealth statutory authority to advise a ministerial council, chaired by the Commonwealth Minister. The council will determine agreed national goals, objectives and priorities, strategic directions and planning processes, and vocational education and training. The States and the Commonwealth will jointly fund the national training system through ANTA. The Commonwealth will maintain its current level of financial support for vocational education and training, and will add the $720m in growth funding announced in One Nation. </PARA>

I would hate to be accused of misleading the Committee by underreporting the amount of contribution we have made. Let me go on with the advice. State training agencies will manage the delivery of vocational education and training, in accordance with planning profiles developed in conjunction with ANTA and agreed by the ministerial council. These new arrangements will enable a major expansion and upgrading of the system to the benefit of industry and young people entering the work force. The advice goes on, but in terms of Senator Crane's question about replacing TAFE functions and making less money available, it is not clear from this advice what the precise answer to that is. I will come back to that a little later and provide the honourable senator with a direct answer.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note the answer that the Minister gave. I also acknowledge that it was not complete&mdash;in terms of my final question. It was made quite clear in the documentation that staff levels in DEET were going to fall and that ANTA would be replacing some of the functions of DEET. The Minister also made it quite clear&mdash;as I understood his answer&mdash;that as far as the establishment of ANTA is concerned, agreement has been reached between the States and the Commonwealth. I am certainly not going to criticise the fact that an agreement was reached. I am critical of why that agreement could not have been developed through the current structures that are in place. From the information that has been given to us&mdash;I anticipate it will also be in the additional information to come&mdash;it seems that the operations of TAFE are being reduced, at a time when it is more than ever needed in this country. With the current levels of unemployment and underemployment, I would suggest that it will be needed for a long time into the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it totally abhorrent that, in establishing ANTA in the way it has been, it is going to be at the expense of the TAFE operations in the various States.

What it needed, if anything, in terms of delivering the services was gingering up and better management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there are two things in the way this has now been structured: firstly, in terms of the run-down of the TAFE operation, a system that is going to address the problem quickly has not been put in place; and, secondly, a structure has been put in place that will increase costs and the problems that I raised in my opening comments. There will be further administration costs; there will be further salary costs rather than the emphasis going to the training side of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Okay. Let me join with Senator Crane on the points that he has made. I do not think there is any foundation at all to say that, simply because a more coherent and comprehensive structure like ANTA is being established, the bureaucracy will expand at the cost of training delivery. In fact, it is the objective of the Commonwealth to ensure that, whatever the necessary ratio of bureaucracy to trainers and training places, that ratio is kept as slim as possible on the bureaucratic side and as wide as possible on the places and trainers side. When there are six States running TAFEs there are by no means the same degrees of efficiencies. One of the coherences that ANTA brings is to try to get that as the most efficient national model and to overcome the bureaucratic end where it is a bit fat in some of the States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a new service or a new structure like this is created there is a phasing in time in which there is a little duplication, but essentially the outcome is a better focus on service delivery. Since we are both Western Australian senators, and Senator Crane was kind enough to make that remark, I too have a high regard for TAFE. In fact, the Commonwealth Government has such a high regard for the TAFEs in the various States that it has chosen to put an extra $720m into them to ensure that they deliver an even better service and have the means to do so. </PARA>

It may be that, in relation to the difference that Senator Crane is playing with here, it is somewhat idle to have a debate about what the Department believes may be the case and what would be prudent provision to meet it, if it were the case; or about what will be the case when, maybe, insufficient time has elapsed to establish the case in the first place.

I do not wish to get into a debate about words; I am not here to get into a debate about words. The answers that we were given were very consistent. The point that I would make is that, if, in fact, costs could be held per unit, in view of the additional demand or economies of scale, as I put it, then we would be looking at an additional 130,000 positions which would be available under current funding without having to pour in the additional amounts of money.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer Senator Crane to page F240 of the Senate Estimates Committee F <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 21 October. In both columns of that page, particularly the outside column, he will see answers from Mr Campbell, of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, which I think answer this question and which, I put to Senator Crane respectfully, answered it at the time he asked it as well. But to further elaborate briefly&mdash;sure, in the cases of many of our programs the unit cost has gone up, and there are good reasons for that. In the case of the special intervention program, the Department of Employment, Education and Training took over a program that existed for non-English speaking migrants from the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. That means that the costs for that program have increased in this Department, although they have decreased in the other department, and the global outcome across government is that the costs are relatively constant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Jobstart, a program that has come in for special mention today, I have to say this: we make no apologies as a Government for providing programs to help unemployed people find work. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why the costs for Jobstart have increased is that the Government increased the length of time during which people are entitled to assistance from that program, as well as the amount per week it would pay. It did both those things in recognition of the level of unemployment and the need to provide positive assistance for people who are looking for work and to encourage them to do so. So, while the point can be made that this appears in these Estimates to be a blow-out of costs, the reason for the higher cost is that we have extended a more humanitarian helping hand by extending the length of time and the amount of subsidy provided for people who are unemployed, and I think that that is a reasonable thing for a government to do in the current economic circumstances. </PARA>

The first point is that I did not criticise Jobtrain or Jobstart; I will be doing that when we bring down the report on employment, education and training in relation to youth. At that stage I intend to address the many obstacles that stand in people's way in terms of getting access to those programs. In fact, this has been described to us as a funnel: the further you go down the funnel, the narrower the outlet gets, and your chances of coming through the bottom are in many instances fairly remote.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is to help them find work or to help them acquire skills to make them more employable and, if they are inevitably faced with an enforced period of unemployment, to make that a period not of idle time, but of training, so that they can pick up places early in the recovery when jobs become more plentiful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that that is a sensible thing for a government to do. If economic activity is as it is, and there is a recession, we cannot hide from those facts. We must help people in those circumstances. While the primary settings of government policy are to end the recession and to have an enduring recovery so that we do not get into a cycle of boom and bust again, one of the labour market support strategies that is being debated here is to use the unfortunate down time to skill up the work force so that we have a highly skilled, better trained work force able to adapt more to new technology and to movements in the market for manufactured goods and services. </PARA>

I understand that those opposite may be embarrassed by it and may want to play a sort of hide the pea trick by shuffling such people around to special benefit on welfare and, by the way, pretending that that is a labour market policy.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The One Nation statement was a commitment in February of the Government to stimulate the economy by an injection of funds&mdash;by investing more directly but not exclusively in public infrastructure in the economy. As well, we made a massive commitment to training and skills programs in Australia in order to turn this country into a more clever country than it has been in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time our effort at stimulation was criticised by the Opposition. The Opposition remains consistent in that it continues to criticise. It does so in the face of the fact that that is exactly what the Japanese economy did; that is exactly what Bill Clinton is proposing to do in the United States; and that is exactly what the OECD is advising its constituent members to do to help stimulate the world economy and bring on world economic growth. In contradistinction, the Opposition's policy is to remove some $7 billion from fiscal policies, thus putting a considerable brake on recovery and reducing the prospect of full employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn to the question. The goals of investing in public infrastructure are worth while. There is no argument that the rail system in this country does need the national rail freight initiative; there is no argument that the rail-port interface investments and the investments elsewhere in training are necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that there has been an undue delay in getting agreement from the States does not reflect badly on the worthiness of the goals we have pursued. It does not reflect badly on the Federal Government that, for example, a conservative dominated Legislative Council in Western Australia should hold up the national rail freight initiative to make it more difficult for us to get the initiative up. It does not reflect on us that the parties there of those opposite blocked those initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we have now reached a point where we believe the goal of stimulating the economy needs to be addressed further. That is why last Friday the Treasurer made a speech in which he redirected some of those funds to create an extra 20,000 jobs immediately by providing for further investment in Jobstart to help every major employer employ more people. Rather than being attacked and diminished by the Opposition, that should be applauded and praised as a positive step to push through the recovery and make it more general, stronger and enduring.</PARA>

I remind him that in February the Prime Minister promised that that program would create more than 800,000 jobs over the next four years. Since then, according to official statistics, a further 60,700 full time jobs have been wiped out, 72,100 more people are out of work and the unemployment rate has climbed from 10.2 per cent to 11.3 per cent with no change in the participation rate. Therefore, I ask the Minister: now that the Government has in effect abandoned its One Nation policy as a failure, what is it offering to solve this long term crisis in Australia, or is it simply offering Australians more of the same?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, there is no doubt that Senator Hill would want to put the worst case that he possibly can. It is the Opposition's desire to talk down the economy, undermine confidence in the private sector and damage the quality of the recovery. Those opposite celebrate and enjoy bad figures. They want to see visited on Australia a worse situation so that they can extract from that where they possibly can some semblance of political point scoring, because they believe that this helps them and their electability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is true is that, because of the policies of this Government, there are now in excess of 1,450,000 extra people in the work force during our period of government than there were during the time when the Opposition occupied the treasury bench. In fact, if the participation rate that applied during the Fraser years applied now, the level of unemployment in Australia would be around the 8 per cent level and not the figure that now shows. It is the fact that more people are offering for employment&mdash;that is, the participation rate is higher under us than under the Opposition&mdash;that a greater number of people are listed as unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not fair to directly link the number of people who are among the 25,000 extra people who got work in October to the One Nation initiatives. Nor, for example, could one say that when the Reserve Bank cuts interest rates and reduces the price of housing and other commodities in Australia that directly links to a given number of new jobs in the jobs list. What is true about the figures from last month is that an extra 25,000 Australians or thereabouts got work, and if that trend continues over a full year, it will be a significant growth in employment around the economy. That is the truth. One does not and cannot disaggregate the figures to show what particular macro-economic settings stimulate particular growth in employment. To go on about it in this way is a falsity. There will be a macro outcome and, when the full weight of the One Nation initiatives are felt, we will be able to chart the course of that macro outcome and give the Opposition a global figure of jobs growth due to those initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is also fundamental is that if the One Nation expenditure that has occurred and that is now imminent did not occur, there would not be the stimulation in the economy and the access to continuing economic growth needed to lead us into recovery.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of a draft report of the Trade Practices Commission which certainly challenges the conveyancing monopoly held by many lawyers' unions in various States of Australia. It indicates quite clearly that competitive market forces ought to be brought into the provision of those conveyancing services. I believe that in some States there is some competition through non-lawyer licence conveyances, and that has had an impact in reducing the price which people have to pay in order to get this sort of advice and the security that comes with the conveyancing of their house.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some 800,000 conveyances a year, which I found to be an astonishing figure. The Trade Practices Commission estimates that the industry must be worth about $1 billion every year to those who charge these fees. That is a tremendous amount to come out of the pockets of Australians for the security of knowing that their home transfer is indeed able to be undertaken with certainty. I believe that Professor Fels said that if there was a $100 reduction in the cost of conveyancing for each transaction, some $80m would be saved to those Australians undertaking conveyancing in those more market-oriented conditions. That is to be welcomed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, all that would be undone if there were a tax paid on the service of conveyancing. If, for example, a services tax of some 15 per cent were to be imposed on that $1 billion industry, then Australians would pay $150m in conveyancing costs by way of taxation to the Federal Treasury. That is an incredible addition. If the reforms of Professor Fels came into place, they might save $80m to $100m. If a 15 per cent GST were imposed on conveyancing fees&mdash;the $1 billion industry&mdash;then $150m extra would have to be paid by Australians for the privilege of having the certainty of knowing that the legal transaction involved in buying and selling homes was one that they could undertake with certainty and security. I believe that that sort of imposition of a goods and services tax ought to be resisted. It would undo great reforms in this area and would completely set at nought and render null and void the advantages that would come from breaking the monopoly of lawyers' unions in respect of this conveyancing.</PARA>

If the Opposition came to government it would add compulsory and mandatory private health insurance to the Medicare levy system, so that all Australians and their households would have to pay an insurance premium in addition to their Medicare levy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Before Question Time started, in the debate on the Appropriation Bills Senator Cook said that Senator Tierney and I had criticised the fact that government expenditure had been too high. We did nothing of the sort. As the Minister is very fond of quoting Fightback, in my personal explanation I refer to the fact that the expenditure in Fightback is some $200m more than the Government's commitment. Nonetheless, what I referred to was the allocation of that expenditure. Administration has gone up by 20 per cent, although outlays have increased by only 17.4 per cent. The cost of the delivery of services was diminishing in real terms and the cost of administration and salaries was increasing. Neither of us&mdash;I certainly did not&mdash;criticised the Government or the Minister for the level of funding.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to correct a figure I gave to the Senate during Question Time last Thursday. I informed the Senate that the Department of Social Security will establish a new exchange rate for the purpose of calculating the entitlements of Australian pensioners receiving pensions from Britain. In the answer I gave to the Senate I referred to 110,000 British pensioners benefiting from this move. It should be noted that there are in fact 110,000 Australian pensioners receiving British pension payments, but of these about 50,000 already receive the maximum Australian pension because of the operation of the three area provisions. The remaining 60,000 will receive an increase in their Australian pension.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The position has developed into a farce. The effect of the guillotine, the conspiracy of the Government and the Australian Democrats&mdash;and I say in passing that I hear that four of the Australian Democrats have gone home, after imposing the guillotine on us and restricting our debate&mdash;is that, despite all due diligence by this side of the chamber, it will be impossible to deal with at least two major departments of state. I make specific reference to the Department of Industrial Relations, because industrial relations and the policies of this Government have helped contribute to a situation where we have a million unemployed in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a right on this side of the chamber to ask questions of the Government's policy in that critical area. Primary industry is but another one. Aboriginal affairs is another area that will not be pursued, not because we do not want to but because this Government is not giving us the opportunity under its guillotine and has been supported by the Australian Democrats in that decision. It seems appropriate, therefore, as only about 20 minutes would be left for this debate&mdash;which means that it is absolutely impossible even to properly commence consideration of these portfolios&mdash;for this chamber to condemn the Government and the Australian Democrats for conspiring in this way to restrict debate in order that we cannot do our job, the job that we have been sent here by the people of Australia to do, and that is to question the Government on these critically important matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not actually referring to Senator Patterson, but she did it also. There has been more than ample opportunity. It is hard to imagine that people can say, `We have been unreasonably constrained; we have only been able to examine the Appropriation Bills for more than 200 hours'. By any stretch of the imagination, any Australian asked to consider whether that was sufficient time would have to say yes, it was. By any stretch of the imagination, those of us who spent those 200 hours debating this legislation would know that most of the time has been wasted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to a series of unanswered questions that were outstanding at the time of the production of the Committee report, particularly a request for details of consultancies for all departments, agencies and statutory authorities. Yesterday I received a statistical summary that was provided by the Northern Land Council with regard to the consultancies that it conducted in the previous financial year and, so far, for the first three or four months of this financial year. The information provided set out only a financial analysis; it did not in any way list the comprehensive details that were sought from all government departments and other agencies. I am rather concerned that even the answer provided by ATSIC itself, which detailed all its own consultancies, has not demanded the same standard of provision of services that was provided by the Northern Land Council.</PARA></TALK.START>

It therefore has to work through those land councils and seek their cooperation in providing the information. I am advised it is likely that the information will be available within one month.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I again express my concern that the question I placed on notice in the first week of September was apparently not relayed or referred to the land councils until about the third week of October. I find that delay totally unacceptable and inexcusable. The fact is that the information may well now take another month. I draw a comparison with the detail that ATSIC provided of its own consultancies and all other government departments and agencies; those that have responded so far have put down comprehensive replies. That is certainly the detail that is required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seek an assurance from the Minister that all that information will be forthcoming as soon as possible and, preferably, well within one month. In the formal course of events, that would be quite appropriate, given the huge amounts of money involved. I know that in the last year the Northern Land Council expended more than $890,000 on financial  consultancies. So far, in the first three or four months of this year, the expenditure has exceeded $400,000. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the Estimates Committee meeting on 10 September, I asked the Minister a variety of questions on notice about Corporate Services expenditure. I would now like to seek clarification of some points:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the last three months of the 1991/92 financial year, the Department bought 5 mobile telephones. Could the Minister please advise the Senate as to what level officers received these telephones, and what their duties are that require them to use a mobile telephone?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During 1991/92, the Department paid for airline lounge memberships for 14 of its officers. The Minister has provided the levels of these officers.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the sitting of Estimates Committee F on September 10th, I asked the Minister about the independent evaluation of the Australian Defence Force function and, in particular, the person employed to perform the evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was informed that it was performed by a temporary employee, Mr Tim Burke, who was employed because of his particular background and experience.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Could the Minister please elaborate on Mr. Burke's background and experience and how it qualified him to write this report?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(Has Mr. Burke ever been an employee of the Department of Industrial Relations?)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(Has Mr. Burke ever been a member of the Australian Defence Force?)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the answer to this is `no':</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(I just wondered because I found some of the report to be expressed in a most unmilitary style. If I could read the following sentence to the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The effectiveness of a collegiate approach in the pay-productivity context, particularly if the focus is on workplace reform rather than broader award-type issues, is likely to depend on both the robustness of supplementation policies and on collaborative agenda setting between the parties.")</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these situations, when an independent report is being prepared, would it not be wise for the Department to consider, at the least, commissioning a co-authored report&mdash;combining someone with experience in Industrial Relations with someone who is aware of the actual effect of Department decisions about ADF pay and conditions on ADF members themselves (that is, an ADF member)?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report talks about the objectives of this sub-program being to provide "fair and reasonable conditions of employment for Australian Public Service and Defence staff". Could the Minister please provide a definition of "fair and reasonable"?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Page 2, para 1.1.1:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Against what criteria is "fair and reasonable" judged? </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Who defines "fair and reasonable"&mdash;is it the Department of Industrial Relations or the Australian Defence Force?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On page 12 of the report, it states: "This report looks at fairness, reasonableness and inconsistency in several ways but does not address the underlying issue of whether the ADF's pay structures are themselves fair and reasonable." How can the report look at fairness and reasonableness if it doesn't examine whether the structures themselves are fair and reasonable?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Executive Summary of the report, on page 1, states that the evaluation found "that the system is, overall, working reasonably well and is delivering outcomes to ADF personnel that are fair and reasonable". How can the report make this judgement when, by its own admission, the report didn't look at whether the pay structures themselves are fair and reasonable?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report itself, on page 7, paragraph 2.2.13, says, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"DIR, in dealing with pay and conditions for the ADF, does not have expert knowledge of the ADF "workplace", nor is it involved in the same way as it is with the APS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why isn't the Department involved in the ADF to the same extent as it is with the Australian Public Service?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Department is lacking in expert knowledge of the ADF workplace, has the Department considered actively recruiting ADF members with experience in HQADF's Pay and Conditions Branch?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On page 8,para 2.3.3, the report states that: ". . . some observers with significant experience of ADF pay and conditions view the ADF's management/advocacy dilemma and relative lack of industrial relations expertise, combined with DlR's distance from the workplace and its reliance for information on the ADF, <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">as a cause for serious concern, </EMPHASIS>suggesting there is a continuing risk that ADF claims will not be as fully tested as they ought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is the Department doing to address this matter, described by the evaluator, as "a cause for serious concern"?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On page 8, para 2.3.1, the report states that: "On conditions for which the Minister for Industrial Relations and his department, rather than the DFRT, have direct responsibility, the ADF seems reasonably satisfied with the outcomes for its members but criticises DIR for slowness and unwillingness to explain decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can the Minister explain what "reasonably satisfied" means and how this fits in with the Department's objectives of providing fair and reasonable conditions of employment?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why is the Department slow and unwilling to explain decisions?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Page 16 of the report states that the Cross Report, completed in 1988, "was critical of DIR, particularly in regard to the processing of some allowances, in the context of a wide range of criticisms or concerns about the management, training, and pay and conditions for the ADF." The report goes on to say that the Government has responded to this by focussing on the Structural Efficiency Principle process. Can the Minister please explain exactly how using the SEP process has been used to address the problems raised in the Cross Report?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(What concrete and tangible changes has the Department made since 1988 to improve the processing of allowances and reduce concerns about management, training and ADF pay conditions?)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Defence Force Advocate, Mr Robert Buchanan QC, has recently resigned. Upon his resignation, Mr Buchanan highlighted problems caused by the Department of Industrial Relations in the determination of ADF pay and allowances. This independent report didn't refer to any difficulties the Defence Force Advocate might have had and I wonder why not?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will the Department, or has the Department, taken note of the problems raised by Mr Buchanan and will they be acted upon?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Page 19 of the report states that: ". . . the management reporting system, revolving around fortnightly narrative reports, is not formatted so as to allow ready evaluation of progress against the key areas, nor to facilitate a management view on whether priorities are changing or should change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What actions have taken place since the completion of this report to correct these problems?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Has the Department developed a management information system "to rectify these deficiencies" as the report recommends?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the final part of the report, on page 20, it is stated that: "Better planning and communication between the ADF and DIR should help to further improve the working relationship between them [to be] less volatile, help them find common ground, improve the presentation of cases before the DFRT, and facilitate the timely conclusion of high priority matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is there now better planning and communication? In what form?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is the relationship between the ADF and the Department less volatile?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report also recommends that the Department's First Assistant Secretary, Remuneration and Conditions Division meet regularly with the Assistant Chief of the Defence Force, Personnel. Are these meetings now taking place? How regularly?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Have seminars for middle ranking and lower level officers in the Department and HQADF, as recommended on page 20 of the report, started to take place?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Could the Minister confirm that the original draft of the June 3 letter&mdash;as disclosed by Mr Thompson in the recent Estimates hearing&mdash;talked about  Minister to Minister discussions of pig semen?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The bulk of the money paid to tertiary institutions by the Department is from the DSTO appropriation. However, DSTO does not make `grants' as such to tertiary institutions. All payments are either in respect of Technical Support Service (TSS) contracts or Research Agreements. TSS contracts are negotiated when it is expected that the research will result in the delivery of a tangible item, such as a piece of software or equipment, and payment is only made for work done. Research Agreements are negotiated with tertiary institutions when the objective of the research is to improve the understanding of certain phenomena of interest to Defence. The outcome of such research is normally in the form of a scientific report of the research results. Payment for Research Agreements is annually in advance.</PARA>
