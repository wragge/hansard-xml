I am talking about what ex-Senator Stone had to say. Senator Stone went on to say that it was the function of Treasury not only to provide advice to government but also to provide analysis in respect of documents and views which were in the public domain and in the political debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought Opposition senators would have known that because these documents were largely obtained as a result of use of FOI by the Opposition. Looking at the situation, the fact is that the work done on Fightback was commissioned long before Mr Keating became Prime Minister and when he was not, in fact, a member of the Government. So I think Senator Hill has really missed the point of this. I agree with the views expressed by the former head of Treasury and a former senator in this place.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of the intense interest shown by various sections of the Australian community, will the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade advise the Senate of the Government's intentions with regard to recognition of the Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="537" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Government is acutely conscious of the sensitivities that are involved in relation to the question of the recognition of what is presently known as the Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia. From the point of view of the people living in this and other parts of the region, and their friends and relatives abroad, we understand and sympathise with their struggle to fulfil their legitimate aspirations for democracy and independence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned about the continuing human suffering which exists in the former region, and we are totally supportive of the efforts within the European Community and the United Nations to bring about a lasting peace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the point of view of Greece, and the Greek community in Australia, the question of the recognition of the Yugoslavian republic known as Macedonia does create a number of problems which do not exist in relation to other present or former Yugoslav republics. The Greek concerns extend to the use of the name `Macedonia', with all its historical and cultural associations; the question of Skopje's commitment to accepting the sovereignty and inviolability of the whole of present day Greece; and also the question of the protection of minorities, in particular the Albanians, who boycotted the 1991 independence referendum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Australian Government is well aware of the strength of feeling which exists on all these issues. We could hardly be otherwise, I guess, given the scale of the rallies and protests around Australia in recent days and weeks. We are also aware of the divided opinion on the issues in question in Europe and will certainly have close regard to the actions taken by the majority of the countries in that region before we make any decision of our own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia will not proceed to recognition until the following basic, outstanding questions are resolved: the name issue&mdash;the use of the word `Macedonia'&mdash;being settled in a way which does not cause further tension with Greece; Greece's concern about possible territorial claims or aspirations being fully met; and the international community's concern about the protection of minorities being fully satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Intense efforts are now under way in Europe to achieve a mutually acceptable outcome between Athens and Skopje on all the relevant issues, and it is important that the Australian Government does not by its actions take any steps that would prejudice that process. We do not want to state any Australian position which assumes that a consensual solution is impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might I just say that the position I have stated is no different in its essentials from that spelt out on behalf of the Opposition, at least by its official spokesmen&mdash;first, Senator Hill on 22 February, and then by Dr Hewson on 28 February. It is a matter of regret, I have to say, that some more strident and unqualified statements by some Opposition Party members have had the effect of turning the issue in some people's minds into a political football. It should not be anything of the kind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Australian policy will continue to be guided above all by our assessment of what will most contribute to the harmonisation of relations between the former Yugoslav republics, and between them and their neighbouring states. We have no wish to see the recognition issue determined in any way which serves only to create new regional tensions in a region which has already been undergoing such rapid change.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Given that the Minister does not seem to know the answer to my question, which I find extraordinary, would he not agree that it would be equally extraordinary for the Government not to subject its own package to the same conceptual analysis to which it has subjected the coalition's package? May I also ask, in the light of his comments about bracket creep, whether the Government's economic statement makes any provision at all to give back to taxpayers the additional revenue gained through inflation pushing taxpayers into higher marginal income tax brackets? In other words, does the Government's package make any provision at all for pay back of bracket creep?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are three parts to the supplementary question. First, Senator Short said that I did not know the answer as to what analysis would be done by Treasury, and he found that surprising. I would not find it surprising. Life is a wheelbarrow full of surprises. The fact that Senator Short, hotted up by this most unfortunate analysis of the consumption tax package from his point of view, the blood rushing to his head, leaps in here today and says, `Ah, we are doing an analysis too', suggesting that I do not know the answer, does not surprise me at all and it should not surprise Senator Short. I am not a know-all like those opposite who blah-blah about the consumption tax package all the time. It purports to be a solution to everything and it is not, as they will see in the next few months.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. In view of the recent reports of fighting in Cambodia, including the wounding of a senior Australian officer with the UN peace keeping force, can the Minister advise what further progress has been made on the implementation of the Cambodia settlement, including the establishment of an Australian mission in Phnom Penh and increased aid to Cambodia?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="540" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to report to the Senate that on 28 February the United Nations Security Council approved the overall plan for the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, or UNTAC. A number of countries, including ourselves, have expressed concern previously about the delays in the deployment of UNTAC putting the Cambodia settlement under some pressure. With the Security Council's approval of that plan, the main part of the implementation of the settlement can now begin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are expecting the UN Special Representative, Mr Akashi, to be in Phnom Penh by mid-March. The Australian General, John Sanderson, who is expected to command the UNTAC military forces, will also hopefully be arriving in Phnom Penh at that time to head up an operation including personnel from some 30 UN member states. The UN Secretary-General, Boutros Ghali, has noted that the plan is directed towards an April 1993 target date for the holding of democratic elections. He will be in Cambodia in April this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the UNTAC plan, in its final form&mdash;although it is like extracting teeth to get the Opposition to admit this&mdash;contains many basic ideas proposed and developed by Australia. I think we can be very pleased with the progress that has been made in its implementation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as Australia's contribution to the operating plan is concerned, we have offered to contribute around 500 personnel, plus or minus, to the peace-keeping operation. That includes the 65 ADF communications personnel who are already serving with the advance mission. We expect to receive very shortly a formal UN request for the participation of Australian personnel. As soon as the details are clarified, we will be making a detailed statement about this to Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In addition, we will be contributing our assessed financial contribution of 1.51 per cent of the total UNTAC budget. We will also be responding to appeals for voluntary contributions to other UN programs for repatriation and rehabilitation. We have already delivered $1m to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees for repatriation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just what the size of the financial impost will be really depends on what the overall total cost of the operation is. On the present planning parameters, it could be as high as US$1.9 billion. The hope by a number of countries, including ourselves, is that it may be possible to implement these planning numbers on a phased basis, which will mean that it may not necessarily be the case that the full number of personnel that have been identified as costing that much will, in fact, be required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the other parts of the question, the Australian mission in Phnom Penh has been established with the first resident Ambassador, Mr Holloway, presenting his credentials on 1 December last. That mission currently has a staff of 10 Australia-based officers, including officers from the Department of Defence, DILGEA and AIDAB. That is soon to increase to 14. It performs the whole range of functions that one would expect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of bilateral aid, restrictions on our bilateral aid were lifted in 1991 following a decision to recognise the SNC. An AIDAB planning mission visited Cambodia in January-February and the Government will shortly decide what funds can be made available for direct aid this financial year. This financial year, indirect aid from Australia to Cambodia, along with flood relief and refugee assistance, has totalled almost $14m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, as to international development assistance, the settlement provides for the establishment of ICORC, the International Committee for the Reconstruction of Cambodia, to coordinate international development assistance. We see a need to move quickly to establish this because of the large flow of international aid, the need for its coordination and the need to coordinate, in particular, rehabilitation projects to be carried out by UNTAC. The major international financial institutions are now planning for major assistance programs to Cambodia. We understand that the Asian Development Bank envisages a program of concessional loans and technical assistance with special emphasis on the rehabilitation of transport and communications infrastructure. The World Bank plans to send a mission to Cambodia in April.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Much of the Opposition's Fightback package is based on a model of the Australian economy built by Dr Murphy&mdash;the so-called Murphy model.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that assumption is correct in either case. I have looked at the consumption tax document. It makes a few assumptions about productivity, some of which are in the tables. So I do not think the issue has been ignored by the coalition, and it certainly has not been ignored by us.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, that is said to be a supplementary question. It is the first supplementary question I have ever had which bears no resemblance at all to the original question. Let me say that I understand it better now. The question is whether in the longer term one achieves a more productive economy as a whole by directing resources into particular areas, which in Senator Coulter's terminology is defined as the productivity of the rail system on the one hand as against the productivity of a casino on the other. Of course the answer to that question is yes. If we made those assumptions there would be differences in the very long term modelling of an economy such as Australia's revealed by choosing one or other of those two scenarios.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to remind the honourable senator that the productivity discussion we have had here really turns on productivity in industry over the next few years without substantial changes being made in the emphasis on investment and consumption expenditure in Australia.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the newspaper reports. The most bizarre one was in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> in which some weird interpretative skills were used to interpret the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures. I prefer to go to the source&mdash;the ABS figures themselves. Those figures just published for the month of October show that under Labor's cooperative approach to industrial management the dispute figures go down and follow the trend downwards under us. Under the Liberal Party's conflict approach to industrial matters, the dispute figures go up and show a worsening trend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that disputes have fallen by 60 per cent under the Labor Government compared with that of the previous Government&mdash;the Liberal-National Party Fraser Government. In New South Wales we are in danger of pushing our record into a worse situation by the unfortunate performance in handling industrial matters by the conservative Greiner Liberal Government. It is showing that Labor States reduce disputes and Liberal States&mdash;in this case, New South Wales&mdash;increase them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me demonstrate that point. The New South Wales labour force consists of approximately two million workers. For October, those two million workers lost 549,800 working days. The rest of Australia, where the work force is four million, lost 13,700 working days through industrial disputes. New South Wales, with half as many workers as the rest of Australia, had 40 times more industrial disputes than the rest of Australia or an incidence of 260 per thousand compared with 3.4 in the rest of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason is that in New South Wales there was a protest stoppage about anti-union legislation and anti-industrial relations legislation by the Greiner Government.

It also confirms that the Fraser style confrontation in New South Wales&mdash;the anti-union cast of that Government to destruct the union movement to drive wages down for ordinary working people&mdash;does lead to industrial disputes. In Labor States, in which they have been quietly going about creating harmony in the workplace, the dispute figures are low. This is in microcosm what we could expect in macrocosm if a Hewson government came to power, given that industrial relations and a consumption tax are cited as the key features of the Fightback policy. It shows why Australian businessmen increasingly say to Mr Howard, as he goes around the traps, `Don't come and talk to us; your policy creates more problems than it's worth. We don't want to speak to you'.</PARA></TALK.START>

Mr Hamel backs this up by saying that the Holden dealers will match the tax savings dollar for dollar on the company's entire range of passenger cars. I should point out, however, that the advertisement says that this offer runs until 31 March.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some price rises in the offing, particularly for imported cars, as a result of exchange rate variations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I just make a general point about the motor vehicle industry. Australian manufacturers express their concern about the increasing penetration of imports into the new car market in Australia. That is happening, I think, largely because of a move to smaller cars not produced in this country, which may or may not be of a permanent nature. I make the point to car manufacturers in Australia that price rises on their cars are an excellent way of assisting importers to take a bigger share of the Australian market.</PARA>

I believe that Australian producers should be making the most of this benefit, not squandering it. It is very important to car manufacturers that they build market share, but also that they build the size of the market overall&mdash;and price, as Australia comes out of the recession, is one way of building market share and building the size of the market in this country. After all, we have a fairly aged car population here. Car manufacturers can contribute to a reduction in the age of the Australian motor vehicle fleet by passing on the price reductions which follow from the reduction in sales tax and by attending to the question of growing the market as well as market share. So the manufacturers should match the price restraint shown by their components suppliers&mdash;and which they expect from their components suppliers&mdash;and by their workers. Last year, for the first time in several years, manufacturers increased their prices faster than inflation, and this is not something that they can continue doing in the long run if they wish to survive and flourish.</PARA></TALK.START>

That assessment, which was based on a series of regular and recent visits to the province and on discussions with a range of people who had also recently visited there, was that daily life in Dili had returned to close to normal, although a great deal of tension and uncertainty remained. There were few confirmed accounts of human rights abuses since the beginning of the year, and no evidence, at that stage at least, to substantiate allegations of a recent deterioration in the human rights situation.</PARA></TALK.START>

In light of Senator Bourne's comments, I will instruct the Embassy to provide an updated assessment of the situation in East Timor, including with regard to these allegations of intimidation and, in particular, the suggestion of the detention of 500 young people in Taibesse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to her three specific questions, officials from our Embassy in Jakarta have been in regular contact with a whole range of government and non-government sources in order to ascertain the charges laid against the East Timorese in relation to the Santa Cruz killings affair. Our latest information is that, of the 384 East Timorese originally detained in Dili, Bali and Jakarta for their alleged activities in connection with the 12 November affair and for related activities, 345 have already been released and another 26 are shortly to be released.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the remaining 13, four are to face subversion charges and nine are to be charged with lesser offences. As to what those lesser offences are, we know that three detainees in Jakarta are to be charged with violations of the criminal code&mdash;namely, publicly expressing enmity or hatred or insulting the Government. With regard to those charged with subversion, although it is the case, as has been reported, that the maximum penalty is death, in practice this sentence is rarely imposed. I for one would find it absolutely extraordinary were the imposition of that sentence to be the case here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the second part of the question, I have raised it with my counterpart, Foreign Minister Alatas, and our Embassy is also continuing to make clear in representations to the Indonesian Government our belief that no-one should be detained or otherwise penalised for non-violent political activities, that those detained should be treated humanely, and that those brought to court should be given proper legal representation and fair trials.</PARA>

Against this background, and given our resource constraints, I do not believe that there is a need for Australian officials themselves to attend the trials.</PARA>

During those meetings Bryan Noakes paid this Government the compliment of saying that there have been more changes, more improvements, in industrial relations in the last six years than there have been in the last 40 years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say this about the whole affair: like the organisers, the Australian Government has been, as everyone should be acutely aware by now, very deeply concerned about the 12 November killings, and we have made that clear in repeated representations to the Indonesian Government. However, we do not believe that this particular ship visit exercise will improve the situation in East Timor in any way. We do not regard that trip as contributing in any useful way to a process of longer term reconciliation in the province.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, of course, for the Indonesian Government itself to decide whether or not to allow the boat to enter East Timor territorial waters. The organisers of the trip have said that they will not be seeking any kind of authorisation from the Indonesian Government. In taking that approach they are simply increasing the likelihood of confrontation with the Indonesian authorities and placing the welfare of their passengers at risk. The commander of the Indonesian armed forces, General Try Sutrisno, was quoted as saying publicly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If they only want to pass through Indonesian waters or if they obtain a Government permit to land that will be all right. If this latter requirement is violated action will be taken.</PARA>
<PARA>Moreover, more recently, on 25 February, the Indonesian Department of Foreign Affairs issued a press statement which said that the ship would not be permitted to come within 12 nautical miles of East Timor. That is on the basis that it is now being said by the Indonesian authorities that they do not regard it as an exercise of the right of innocent passage even to steam within those territorial waters because of the nature of the campaign that the ship will be waging, and it being outside the terms of article 19, I think it is, of the Law of the Sea Treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the Government's perspective, I would certainly urge all Australians to think very carefully before participating in this exercise. We would expect the Indonesian response to be graduated in accordance with standard international maritime procedures if the vessel does attempt to enter Indonesian territorial waters without appropriate authorisation and it does provoke Indonesian authorities by acting in that way. One cannot exclude the possibility that something may go wrong, however, whatever the intentions of the Indonesian authorities may now be about handling such an incident, resulting in risk to passengers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the vessel arrives in Darwin, Australian Government officials will be advising the captain of the vessel of the risks involved in attempting to visit Dili without proper authorisation. We will refer in particular to the fact that Australian citizens may be joining the vessel and the Australian Government's interest in their welfare. Whether that interest will extend to picking up the tab for legal aid, or anything of that kind, should problems arise, is something we will consider if that hypothetical situation arises. I am not prepared to speculate about that now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to whether the vessel will be allowed entry into the port of Darwin to pick up passengers, that is essentially a matter for other government agencies rather than the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. However, my understanding is that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lusitania Expresso</EMPHASIS> will be treated like any other vessel wishing to make a call at an Australian port. If it satisfies the usual requirements, it will be allowed to make the port call.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Resources. I direct the Minister to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 24 February 1992, which stated that the Russian Parliament had approved a law on mineral rights geared towards encouraging foreign investment in the country's oil, gas and mining sectors, which in turn would lead to the revitalisation of those industries.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the article to which Senator Jones refers. The Australian Government has had an ongoing dialogue with the Government of the former Soviet Union and the Government of the Russian Federation concerning Australian industry's involvement in Russian energy resources. Indeed, I think the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, visited Vladivostok for an Australian trade exhibition in July 1990, followed by a visit by Mr Griffiths to the former Soviet Union in July of last year. My colleague here, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, also discussed opportunities for Australian involvement in resource development during his visit to the Soviet Union in November last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opportunities for commercial cooperation between Australia and the maritime province of the Russian far east were the focus of a visit to Australia by the governor of that province, Mr Vladimir Kuznetsov, last month. As a result of the discussions, I am informed that Senator Evans announced the formation of the Committee on Australian-Russian Far East Relations. The Committee will meet annually and will act as a clearing house for information on opportunities for greater bilateral economic and commercial cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first meeting is scheduled for Vladivostok later this year, and will be attended by both government representatives and business interests which have significant current or potential involvement in this resource-rich area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Trade Commission has also played a key role in keeping Australian companies informed of the rapidly changing commercial environment in the newly independent countries of the former Soviet Union. Austrade has also appointed a trade correspondent in Vladivostok to facilitate the visits of Australian business people to this resource rich region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of that, I should also say that Australia is assisting with the international energy missions to the Commonwealth of Independent States being organised for later March this year. The missions were established by the IEA following the Washington conference on assistance to the new independent states in January. There are three consultative group missions each composed of 15 industry representatives and nine government officials. The groups have a broad mandate to expand a contact with energy industries in the CIS republics and to assess the opportunities for improving supply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot of other information that I can supply to the Senate on this matter. I conclude by saying, on behalf of Minister Griffiths, that he has ensured that a range of information on resource taxation and mineral rights has been forwarded to Russian officials to help them in setting up the right framework, and that Australia has an industry presence over there for some time due to the investment of BHP Petroleum in the bidding for the development of the Shackleton offshore petroleum and natural gas development project. I understand that the successful bid is yet to be determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, on the issue of tax incentives to Australian companies which invest in Russia, the Government will continue to rely on a number of broad measures already in place to assist Australian exports and overseas investments. Australian companies can draw on these assistance programs as appropriate for any proposals for investment in Russia. Investment assistance targeted at specific countries could comprise the opportunity that exists for Australian companies to assess overseas investment proposals this month.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have just been advised that the total reinsurance costs in South Australia for the quarter ended the 30th September, 1991 is $26.1M which is nearly a 50% increase compared with the same quarterly period two years ago. If the cost increases are of this magnitude then we have no option but to significantly increase our members; hospital contribution rates as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June 1989 your Federal Labour Government introduced sweeping changes to the reinsurance health laws. Your objectives were "to protect the elderly and share the insurance risk" by spreading the hospital costs of every over 65 privately insured member amongst each health fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In South Australia the reinsurance laws have worked to the advantage of Mutual Community who have been able to spread their high elderly costs amongst all health funds. This may achieve your objective of equalising the elderly hospital costs, but what has it done to protect the elderly? As all health funds, including Mutual Community, have been increasing their contributions by drastic amounts to cover these reinsurance costs, there is no protection for the elderly especially those on fixed incomes, or in times of falling interest rates on decreasing incomes. Consequently in South Australia private health insurance membership has been falling dramatically with your reinsurance legislation. There is no protection for the elderly who are being forced out of private health insurance altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">H.B.F. is the only established health fund in South Australia that has managed to retain its membership since the reinsurance changes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are appreciative of the efforts being made by the National Health Strategy to try and sort out some sensible health system.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XG4">Senator GILES</NAME></TALKER>

They also include what may be a legislative power involving compulsion in otherwise helpful notes in the body of the instrument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Capital Territory electoral regulations provide good quality safeguards for persons who fail to vote in elections and who subsequently elect to pay an administrative penalty rather than go to court.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(70 TO 87.5 MHZ)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">STATUTORY RULES 1991 NO.355</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both these instruments are unusual examples of Statutory Rules which are not regulations. They were made under the parent Radiocommunications Act 1983, which provides that the Minister may prepare frequency band plans, consistent with the spectrum plan in the Act, providing for the purposes, the areas and the times during which the band may be used. The present instruments provide for the expansion of existing services and the introduction of new kinds of services. Both Plans were accompanied by extensive Explanatory Statements. They also included general and specific Notes in the body of each instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Committee still has concerns about the instruments. These concerns relate to appropriate safeguards for users of the radio spectrum who are affected by the Plans. Both Plans provide for wide exemptions from their apparently mandatory requirements with inadequate criteria for the exercise of this power, the instruments themselves merely providing that an exemption may be granted where arrangements are more efficient, with no further criteria. There is a Note which lists further criteria, but there is no advice whether these criteria have a legislative basis (for example, they may have been informally extracted from the parent or another Act) or are simply advisory guidelines drawn up by the Department. Another provision includes the expression, "unless the contrary intention appears", with no advice as to who decides whether this is the case. Another appears to authorise complete exemption from an important part of the Plan without any immediate indication, at least on its face, of who is to exercise this discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Note advises that another discretion exists with the Secretary, or any officer of the Department authorised by the Secretary, with no indication of whether this power is legislative or administrative. There is no apparent provision in either of the instruments for review of these discretions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other Notes advise that each Regional Office of the Department will develop and manage the detailed program for conversion of services in their region. Such conversion "will generally require modification or replacement of existing equipment" and "individual users will be required by the relevant Regional Office to convert their service earlier than the relevant State conversion date". The Notes then list what are stated to be measures to minimise the impact of the cost and disruption for users. It is unusual for such power, which appears to include compulsion, to be given to public servants, possibly without direct legislative authority. In any event, it is normal for safeguards for users to be included directly in statutory rules, rather than in Notes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">  AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY   (ELECTORAL)  (MODIFICATIONS OF THE COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL ACT 1918) REGULATIONS, STATUTORY RULES 1991 NO.397</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Regulations modify many aspects of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 in its application to the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One set of modifications provide that a person who does not reply to a "please explain" notice in respect of an alleged failure to vote in an election, or who replies and whose explanation for not voting is not accepted, may opt either to pay $20 to the Electoral Commissioner or to appear before the Magistrate's Court, where the maximum penalty is $50 plus costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations provide good quality safeguards for those people who are satisfied to be dealt with by administrative procedures rather than appear before a court. If such people pay the $20, then they discharge all liability in respect of the offence, they may not be charged in any other proceedings and, of special significance, they are not regarded as having been convicted of an offence. These are very important safeguards which should receive the widest possible publicity.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 26 November 1991, the Leader of the Opposition, on behalf of the Opposition Parties, tabled in this House a document titled Fightback! which contained, among other things, the Opposition's taxation and expenditure proposals for the next Federal elections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The monument of the package is the proposed imposition of a new tax of 15% on the purchase and consumption&mdash;by every Australian&mdash;of nearly all goods and services. This would raise, on the Opposition's figuring, some $27.2 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For many years, it has been recognised as being in the public interest for the policies of the "alternative government" of the day to be costed and analysed in terms of their economic and social impacts, in much the same way as policy proposals of the Government of the day are subjected to rigorous official analysis and testing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with this long established practice&mdash;observed by successive Governments, of all political persuasions&mdash;the Opposition's consumption tax proposals have been subjected to the official scrutiny of the Departments of the Treasury and Finance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 9 December 1991, my colleague the Minister for Finance publicly released the Department of Finance costings of the Opposition's expenditure proposals as spelled out in its so-called Fightback package. A week later, on 16 December, the Minister made public the details of an analysis by the Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office of the revenue side of the package.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Treasury has also undertaken a distributional analysis of the Opposition's package which, as far as it is technically possible to do so, traces the complex and clouded money flows in the package and identifies the net financial impact on Australian households. This analysis was not publicly released ahead of the rising of the Parliament for the summer recess.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 18 December 1991, the honourable Member for Flinders made an application under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI) for access to documents provided between 19 November and 17 December 1991 to the then Treasurer and his predecessor by the Department of the Treasury and the Treasurer's Office which relate to the Opposition's consumption tax package.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Upon the change in Ministerial arrangements in late  December and my assuming the responsibilities for the Treasury portfolio, I reviewed the documents which are the subject of the FOI application and I determined that as the documents are of general public interest, they be tabled in this House within the first five sitting days of the next sitting, as provided for under section 21 (1) (d) of the FOI Act. The documents I will be tabling today include three prepared within the Treasurer's Office itself&mdash;namely documents 1, 2 and 16.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. FISCAL HOLE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable senators will recall that, taken together, the costings prepared by the Departments of Finance and Treasury and the Taxation Office demonstrated that the Opposition's figuring on its package is fundamentally flawed. The proposed expenditure cuts are massively overstated to the order of $2.7 billion and revenue is understated to the order of $1.1 billion, giving a total funding shortfall in the package of nearly $4 billion. On the best information available to those official agencies that would have primary responsibility for implementation of the package, it does not add up: it has a $4 billion hole. To that extent, the package is simply not capable of implementation unless it were to be fundamentally re-cast and re-worked.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How can the Opposition have got it so wrong?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To put this in context, the Opposition's package would be underfunded by the amount necessary to pay, for example, for three of the key elements of the "compensation" package:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the shortfall means that the Opposition could not fund the 8% increase in social security and veteran's pensions and the 6% increase in all other social security, education and training allowances. These are intended to compensate for the inflationary effect of the consumption tax (they have been costed by the Department of Finance at $2,374 million in year 3)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">and the Opposition would not have the funds to meet its promised increases in Family Allowances ($1.036 billion)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">in addition, the $565 million re-insurance pool subsidy to reduce the rising costs of health insurance premiums, as result of elderly and chronically ill people taking out private insurance, could not be funded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From these objective costings of the Opposition's package, it is quite clear that, if it were ever to win Government, the Opposition's promises to compensate Australians for the introduction of its consumption tax could not be met. Perhaps this is what the Opposition Leader meant when he declared, in launching the package, that "My concept of  compassion isn't to compensate them for what I fail to deliver . . . .".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Alternatively, the Opposition could cover its funding gap with a substantially higher consumption tax&mdash;say, at 17.5% rather than the 15%&mdash;with no compensation for the additional impost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition claim that it will not do this. The Leader of the Opposition went so far as to solemnly declare that he would resign before countenancing such an increase. But if the rate isn't increased, what are the Opposition Leader's options?  The promised compensation would have to be slashed: pensioners and families would miss out, but they would still have to pay a new 15% tax on every single item of food consumed, clothing bought and anything else they purchased.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The $4 billion fiscal hole is itself enough to sink Fightback as a credible economic statement. But Treasury's distributional analysis, which will be among the documents to be tabled today, exposes its shallowness as a political manifesto. Fightback is like the cities built for Catherine of Russia: all facade and no substance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. DISTRIBUTIONAL ANALYSIS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let us, for the purposes of this exercise, suspend reality and go to that model world inhabited by the Opposition, where "two plus two" might add up to five or maybe only three, depending on the needs of the situation. It's a world where white is just a lighter shade of grey and where black, after all, is just a darker shade of grey. Let us, for the purposes of this exercise, put aside the $4 billion hole in the Opposition's calculations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To go to the very heart of the point, for two months the Leader of the Opposition has been travelling the country declaring that under the Opposition's tax package "everyone will be a winner".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition Leader's declaration is based on chapter 17 of his consumption tax plan, which purports to quantify "the impact of the Coalition's reform (sic) package on the net financial position of Australian households.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition has made three key assertions concerning the redistributional effects of its package. These are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">that all groups in the community show increases in average disposable income after allowing for the effects of the consumption tax</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">that there is a bias in the package in favour of families with children</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">and that the distribution of net benefits is skewed in favour of lower income groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Treasury's analysis, however, has demonstrated that each of these claims is untrue. The consumption tax appears to be little more than a disguise for a redistribution of income from lower and middle income earners to high income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Detailed examination of the consumption tax package shows&mdash;contrary to the assertions of the Opposition&mdash;that there are, in fact, very few winners. Indeed, so far as it is possible to follow the consumption tax money trail and using the Opposition's methodology&mdash;and I will deal with the methodology of the Opposition's figuring in a moment&mdash;that trail leads to an outcome where over 70% of households of full-time wage and salary earners and about 60% of self-employed and farmer households would be worse off under the Opposition's proposed arrangements (see Attachment 1).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, the Treasury analysis shows that wage and salary earner and self-employed and farm households on incomes of $90,000 a year and above would be better off by between $15 and $105 a week&mdash;that is, by up to $5,460 a year better off.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By contrast, married full-time wage and salary earners with non-working spouses and children, and family incomes up to $57,000 a year, would be worse off by up to $8 a week&mdash;that is, up to $400 a year worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, self-employed and farm households with incomes up to $61,000 a year would be anything up to $12 a week worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Attachment 2 shows the full distributional results of the Treasury analysis before road user charges and the funding shortfall are allocated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, the Treasury analysis shows that, under the Opposition's preferred Scenario C, on the tax measures alone&mdash;that is, not factoring in any other changes&mdash;all people paying tax on incomes below $40,000 a year would not be adequately compensated both for bracket creep and for the price effect of the Opposition's package. That is, the Opposition's own proposed tax scales would not compensate low and middle income earners for its new food and clothing tax (see Attachments 3 and 4).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, a taxpayer on an income of $30,000 a year would receive a tax cut of 6.8% under the Opposition's announced plan but, after taking account of bracket creep and the CPI impact of the consumption tax, taxpayers on this income would still suffer a decline in real disposable income of some 2%.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus, while taxpayers on an income of $30,000 a year would be $9.20 a week worse off, people on $100,000 a year would  be $73.20 a week better off.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, taxpayers on $30,000 would receive a tax cut which would be only about three-quarters of that necessary to compensate for the introduction of the consumption tax. But people on $100,000 would get a tax cut which is almost double that which would be adequate to compensate them for the reduction in their purchasing power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the Opposition's notion of fairness&mdash;an Opposition which last and this week was in mock mourning over the plight of low income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major beneficiaries of the Opposition's package would be the top 10% of each type of wage and salary earner household and self-employed and farm households. Meanwhile Treasury's analysis clearly shows that the vast majority of full-time wage and salary earner households would see their real incomes fall.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. METHODOLOGICAL SHORTCOMINGS OF OPPOSITION ANALYSIS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Treasury's distributional results are very different to those contained in chapter 17 of the Opposition's consumption tax plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How could the Opposition have got it so wrong?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not just that the Opposition made some mistakes&mdash;and make some fundamental mistakes they certainly did. Regrettably, all the evidence suggests that the Opposition's analysis, which shows "everyone to be a winner", is clearly deceptive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reasons for the difference between Treasury's distributional analysis and that of the Opposition and its advisers are very straightforward.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To begin with, Opposition calculations do not include all of the elements of the package that the Opposition is actually proposing to implement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On one side of the ledger, the Opposition has included in its distributional analysis anything at all that could be characterised as compensating for the consumption tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has reduced the price increases flowing from the consumption tax with each and every price decrease which it has calculated will flow from its promised abolition of the wholesale sale tax, payroll tax and fuel excise. And it has included as a benefit to households each and every "gain" which it has calculated to flow from personal income tax cuts and tax rebates, consumption tax credits, health tax credits and increases in government transfer payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, on the other side of the ledger, the Opposition appears to have left out those parts of the package that  most hurt low to middle income households.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, the Opposition appears to have excluded from its distributional analysis the impact of such significant funding elements of its own package as:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">expenditure savings of approximately of $6.5 billion (based on its own costings), including changes in the eligibility for some transfer payments</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">increases in a range of other taxes including tobacco excise, company tax, the Medicare levy surcharge on high income earners and the dependent spouse rebate income test</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">changes to health care arrangements, such as removal of bulk-billing for most Australians</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">bracket creep, which is estimated to contribute about $3 billion to the funding of the Opposition package</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">and some non-funding elements such as the Opposition's superannuation and savings policies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Treasury analysis has imputed a number of the expenditure cuts but has not attempted to impute to households all the elements excluded from the Opposition analysis. Accordingly, the Treasury analysis not only understates the number of households that are worse off, but also understates the extent to which households are actually worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, in contrast to the Opposition's analysis, the Treasury's work has taken into account a number of the Opposition's funding proposals. These include:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">introduction of the proposed family income test for the dependent spouse rebate</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">lowering the income test threshold for Family Allowance</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">removing AUSTUDY where present eligibility is less than $30 a week</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the health care measures such as removal of bulk-billing for most Australians</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">tightening of the income and assets tests for pensions, Family Allowance, Family Allowance Supplement, AUSTUDY, and the junior Job Search Allowance</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a new parental income and assets tests for 18-20 year old Job Search Allowance recipients living at home</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">removal of the sole parent pension where the child is aged 12 or over (assuming that the sole parent transfers to JSA)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">and bracket creep.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The point, of course, is not to do with the merits or otherwise of any or all of these proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The point is that, while the Opposition claims that it is being frank and honest with the community, it omits from its calculations issues which are capable of analysis under its methodology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But that is not the end of the Opposition's creative accountancy methods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. HOUSEHOLD EXPENDITURE SURVEY DATA</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basis of both the Treasury distributional analysis and that of the Opposition is the 1988-89 Household Expenditure Survey (HES).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Table 17.4 of the Opposition document presents estimates of the "percentage increase in real disposable incomes" as a result of its package. As the Opposition concludes, the change in real disposable income is the appropriate measure of the adequacy of compensation [page 301].</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes in real disposable income are calculated for 140 different household types or cells. These 140 cells consist of a 14-way split based on household characteristics combined with a 10-way split based on income for each household type. This 10-way split divides households of any given type (e.g. self-employed and farmers) into 10 equal groups, called deciles, based on income. Thus decile 1 represents the lowest 10% of income earners for that household group, decile 2 represents the second lowest and so on up to the tenth decile.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition has represented Table 17.4 as an illustration of  the full effect of its package on different households.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact it falls well short of that description.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the first place, as I have already pointed out,  the Opposition has excluded significant elements of its package from its analysis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the second place, the Opposition has treated all cells as equally valid representations of the impact of the consumption tax package on households of that type and income range.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This treatment of the HES data is wrong. It is nothing more than a statistical nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The HES is based on a sample survey. As the data are divided into smaller and smaller sub-sets, the accuracy of any derived estimates declines rapidly. Some cells used in  the Opposition analysis contain as few as 7 households and are clearly useless as a guide to the impact of the package.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, it is questionable practice to apply any statistical analysis to a cell containing fewer than 30 households&mdash;they are statistically insignificant. But some 50 of the 140 cells in the Opposition analysis fall into this category. That is, over  one-third of the cells in the Opposition's analysis are statistically insignificant and should be ignored as they cannot provide any meaningful guide to the effect of the Opposition's package.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These cells have been reported in Treasury's own analysis simply for the sake of comparison and to provide consistency with the Opposition's tables. But the Treasury has been at pains to put distance between it and the statistical methods of the Opposition. I note that among the documents to be tabled today&mdash;document 3 in fact&mdash;is a minute dated 19 December 1991 which, in commenting on a draft press release, insisted that the words "on the basis of the Opposition's methodology" be inserted because:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">". . . .we would not want it to appear that Treasury was endorsing this type of analysis as providing realistic estimates of likely distributional outcomes".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So much for the Opposition and what it claims to be a "professional" analysis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. BRACKET CREEP</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But that's still not the end of the illusion. The Opposition also uses taxpayers' own funds&mdash;the result of bracket creep&mdash;to fund compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tax bracket creep describes the increase in the tax burden caused when the tax scale is not adjusted for the effects of inflation. Accordingly, unless the tax scale is adjusted, higher nominal wage levels push taxpayers into higher average tax rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition plans to use all of the available results of bracket creep&mdash;about $3 billion&mdash;to help fund its promised tax cuts. This is presented as compensation for the consumption tax. Of course, the return of bracket creep can in no way compensate for the inflationary impact of the Opposition's consumption tax package. True compensation requires that taxpayers have all the bracket creep returned before they receive any additional tax cuts as compensation for the consumption tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, the Opposition has been very vocal about its fist full of dollars but it hasn't mentioned at all that it will have a hand in every taxpayer's pocket to pay for it. Quite simply, the Opposition is proposing to take $3 billion out of the pockets of Australian taxpayers in  order to give it back to them in the guise of "compensation" for the introduction of their consumption tax. This is a very crude pea and thimble trick indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Attachment 3 compares the Opposition's proposed tax cuts with what would actually be required to compensate for the CPI effect of the consumption tax package and bracket creep. On this measure alone&mdash;that is, not allowing for other tax and expenditure changes or a higher CPI effect&mdash;it can be seen that all people paying tax on incomes below $40,000 a year would not be adequately compensated by the Opposition's proposed tax scales for the price effect of the consumption tax package. This means that the overwhelming majority of Australian taxpayers will not be adequately compensated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taking this $3 billion from bracket creep together with the $4 billion fiscal hole, it is clear that of the compensation which the Opposition is offering, $7 billion of that, is simply not available to the Opposition for its purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How could the Opposition get it so wrong?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. INFLATION EFFECTS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inflation outcomes are, of course, central to the calculation of the "compensation" element of the consumption tax package and to its broad macro-economic impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition calculated the CPI effect of its consumption tax to be 4.7 per cent. Treasury's calculation, on the same basis, resulted in a 3.9 per cent effect. The inclusion of Opposition health policy changes increased the estimated net CPI effect to 4.6 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, to this must be added a further 0.3% to account for the proposed reintroduction of the recently removed Medicare co-payment and the reduction in the wholesale sales tax on passenger motor vehicles, bringing the calculated effect to 4.9%.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also the problematic area of road user charges which the Opposition has committed itself to introducing but for which the Opposition has steadfastly refused to provide any details.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, road users, through fuel excises and registration fees, contribute to government revenues more than is required to meet road expenditures. The Government, in consultation with the States, has been developing proposals for road user charges that seek to redistribute the charging burden according to road use. They do not aim to increase the amount of revenue raised from road users.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Treasury has modelled the effects of an illustrative road  user charge based on vehicle registration fees designed to ensure that aggregate road expenditure is paid for by users. This modelling implies an average increase in registration fees of more than 160 per cent for light vehicles and over 200 per cent for heavy vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, if the Opposition proceeded&mdash;as it has indicated it would&mdash;with registration based road user charges, on the reasonable assumption that these would be designed to recoup costs, these charges would add over one percentage point to the CPI impact of the Opposition's proposals. The total CPI effect of the Opposition's package would thus be 5.6 per cent&mdash;before the impact of the removal of the Medicare co-payment and wholesale sales tax changes on cars.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What does this mean in terms of the Opposition's proposed compensation package?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The short answer is that, combined with the other elements in the Opposition's package, the increases in registration fees would leave more than 80 per cent of full-time wage and salary, self employed and farm households worse off. The majority of full-time wage and salary earner households would see real disposable income fall by between $5 and $35 per week, while the majority of self employed and farm households would be between $4 and $22 per week worse off (see Attachment 5).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to understand, however, that it is not just the total CPI increase that is relevant: the distribution of price increases across the basket of goods and services that people purchase illustrates starkly why this is truly a tax on food and clothing, as illustrated so graphically by my predecessor on 19 December 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated price effects (see Attachment 6) of the Opposition package on food products generally will be 8.9% overall (or 9.57% with the effect of road user charges):</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">dairy products will increase by 9.6% (10.4% with road user charges)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">cereal products will increase by 9.2% (9.9% with road charges)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">fresh fruit and vegetables will increase by 10.1% (11% with road charges).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But one supposes the Opposition will proudly point to the fact that, while the price increases of the staple fresh foods are up a bit, soft drinks, icecream and confectionery only rise by 4.3% (or 5% with road charges).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of other basic components of household budgets, clothing would rise by 11.2% (11.8%), electricity would jump 10.7% (11.2%), post and telephone services would rise by 8.1% (8.5%) and health services would rise by 22.6% (22.9%).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Price rises of this magnitude would effect every Australian, and every Australian family, and have their greatest impact on those on low incomes and with families to feed and clothe.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not only the case that the Opposition is promising to deliver inadequate compensation for the inflationary effect of the consumption tax&mdash;it would commit Australia to a permanently higher rate of inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reason for this is simple:  the Opposition has no wages policy. Does it seriously expect low and middle income wage and salary earners of this country to stand idly by while the Opposition under-compensates them while over-compensating high income earners?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because the Opposition has no wages policy, it will have to rely on tight monetary policy to prevent the demands for compensating wage increases from feeding into higher inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the end, there would be no choice. Interest rates would have to increase to stop the consumption tax feeding into higher wages and inflation, in turn feeding into higher wage demands, thus triggering a permanent increase in inflation, not the one-off blip the Opposition claims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Higher interest rates mean higher housing loan rates. If housing loan interest rates increased by 2 percentage points from today's rates, weekly repayments on a $40,000 mortgage would increase by about $13 per week, by about $25 on a $75,000 mortgage and by over $34 for mortgages of $100,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These increases virtually absorb all of the Opposition's proposed tax cuts, before taking account of the effects of bracket creep and compensating for the 15 per cent consumption tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. SAVINGS RATIOS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, I have to mention the use of so-called "cameos" or family snapshots by the Opposition to make the shift from income to consumption tax look beneficial and to personalise the "everyone's a winner" theme. They're worth a close look.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Opposition's package, those families which invest more get higher benefits because their income tax is lower and they pay less consumption tax. So in constructing its cameos, the Opposition has picked examples from the Household Expenditure Survey which have high savings ratios so as to artificially reduce the impact of the consumption tax. Treasury has examined these examples and determined the implied savings ratios:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sue and Con, on two incomes totalling $1,878 a week,  with 3 children, have a savings ratio of 40%</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mary and Greg, on 1 income of $537 plus Family Allowance of $20 a week, with 2 children, have a savings ratio of 38%</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Julie, unemployed, receiving a benefit of $139 a week, has a savings ratio of 26%</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Harold and Dulcie, aged pensioners on $252 a week, have a savings ratio of 47%.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quite obviously, these savings ratios are absurd: in 1990-91, the average household savings ratio was 6.3%. Is the Opposition seriously suggesting that unemployed persons ought to be saving over a quarter of their unemployment benefit?  Does the Opposition really believe that pensioners ought to be saving nearly half their pensions?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9. CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fundamental and unresolved problems of the Opposition's package go, of course, much further than I have described.   There are their defective policies on savings, on superannuation, on micro-economic reform, on wages and on unions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a deeper issue, however, that I now wish to address.  It is the question  any thinking person has to ask.  It is more than a question. It  is the heart of the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the one hand we have in Fightback a package that, does not add up.  That is fact.  It remains fact, however you like to look at it.  That implies that there is something its authors propose to do that they do not want to tell us.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then there is the extraordinary consequence for the community. Instead of everyone being a winner, as we are told, over 70 per cent of wage and salary earning households in this country will be worse off. Over 60 per cent of farm and self-employed households will be worse off. This is the plan that purports to offer people hope.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You can be certain that these features of Fightback will come as more than a shock for most Liberals, and especially Nationals. Come as a shock it should.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The name of the package is Fightback. But the battle, the fight is being carried not to this Government, which is its supposed object, but to the ordinary households of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the banner of giving people more control over their lives, the Opposition package gives ordinary people less. If you have your income diminished, as Fightback promises for the majority, you cannot, I suggest, be having more control over your life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But under this slogan the Opposition package says to people not just that they should look after themselves more. It says something different. It says: They are on their own. They are on their own to negotiate with their employer; they are on their own to insure themselves for adequate health care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are easily identifiable winners and losers in  the Hewson Australia. The losers are the labourers, not the lawyers; the nurses, not the neurosurgeons; the teachers, not the tax accountants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not the way that Australia has won its successes in the past.  It is a way that promises no success for our future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And the point is that, with the exception of its ideological leadership&mdash;the men driven by dogma&mdash;the majority of Liberals and Nationals know that only too well.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They know that their Party can have a durable claim on government only if they have the capacity to govern for all Australians, fairly and equitably; if they can lead a unified people;  and if they can maintain a cohesive society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most serious and the deepest problem with Fightback is that it can claim none of these things.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The saddest thing about Fightback is that the Opposition is now locked so far into something on which it was misinformed by its leadership, from which it cannot retreat.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some in the Opposition imagine that they are on a roll. But  I remind them that even the Gadarene swine thought the going was good, until they were half-way down.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On this side of the House, we aspire to One Nation: a nation which is rich because of the knowledge, skills and values of its people: a nation which prospers and is capable of making its way in the world: a nation which is humane and provides adequately for the needs of all its people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This cohesive nation, concerned for its citizens, is very different from the one which would emerge from the Opposition's ideological experiment&mdash;an experiment designed to prove the superiority of those in the community who already have a head start.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The clearest conclusions to be drawn from the analysis which I present today is that the Opposition's proposals are basically unfair, which is in sharp contrast to the claims made for them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The publication of this material will reveal just how unfair these proposals are and I commend a study of these documents to every member of this House and indeed every citizen of this nation.</PARA>

The tests and assumptions that the Treasury analysis applies to the Fightback package are different from those it uses for costing its own deeply flawed economic statement handed down last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before going into the details of these matters, I will comment briefly on the nature and content of last night's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program on the ABC. I preface my remarks by saying that my colleagues in the coalition will be debating fiercely not only the content of today's ministerial statement and the Treasury basis for it but also the fraud perpetrated on this Parliament by the disclosure to the ABC, in advance of its release to this Parliament, of a document which was the product of a freedom of information request from the coalition and which, of course, should have been released first to the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say something else about the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program televised last night. Rarely has the Australian public been presented with such a blatantly politically biased program. The shadow Treasurer was given approximately one hour to look at the Treasury document before he was interviewed on it. The family studies that were included in the first part of the program were not accurately portrayed at all, certainly in their relevance to the coalition's proposals. The use of Ms Louise Sylvan of the Australian Consumers Association to provide assessments of the packages of consumer purchases is a great testimony to the lack of objectivity and the basic bias in those studies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People should be aware that Ms Sylvan is the Executive Director of the Australian Consumers Association&mdash;the largest consumer organisation in Australia, the largest single component of the umbrella body which purports to represent consumer groups in Australia, namely, the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations. Ms Sylvan, through her position on the ACA, is on the AFCO governing council. During the term of the Hawke and Keating governments, AFCO has received more than $1.8m in direct grants. During the 1987 Federal election AFCO declared, `Consumers should vote Labor'. The former chairman of AFCO, Gary Mason, said of AFCO, `Groups like ourselves are the very things the Labor Party is about'. The ALP policy platform explicitly names AFCO as an organisation to be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AFCO has come out publicly and opposed many of the proposals in the coalition's Fightback package, yet the ABC had the stupidity to get a representative from the main organisation within that peak body, AFCO, and then try to purport to the Australian public that its assessment was objective and unbiased. That is an absolutely stupid thing for the ABC to have done. By doing this, it removed any credibility that the program may otherwise have had; that was limited by that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing to be asked&mdash;and it was asked by Senator Bishop in Question Time, and she got an absolutely unacceptable answer from Senator Button&mdash;is: how did the ABC get this document? It was a document that was to be produced to the coalition under freedom of information. It was, to that extent, a privileged document. We received that document only now in the Senate, formally through its tabling here. It was requested months ago by the shadow Treasurer. It has not been received, as I say, until today. How did the ABC get that document? When did the ABC get that document? Who gave the ABC that document?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understood Senator Button's response to Senator Bishop in Question Time today, Senator Button was `quite convinced it did not come from the Treasury'. Well, there are not too many places that this document could have come from. It could have come from the Treasury, but if it did not come from the Treasury, where else could it have come from? It seems to me that there are only three other places where it could have come from: one, from the Treasurer or his office; two, from the Prime Minister; and, three, if not from the Prime Minister, then from his office. If Senator Button is quite convinced that it did not come from the Treasury, by implication, he is saying that it came out of either the Treasurer's office or the Prime Minister's office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This just reinforces the view that is widespread throughout the community as of now that one cannot trust this Government, that it has no credibility and that it does nothing other than play political games of the most biased nature. I believe that last night's ABC-Dawkins co-production marks a new low in this Government's corruption of our institutions. In complete defiance of convention, as I said, the Government has supplied material to the media before it released it to Parliament and the Australian public. It is bad enough that the Government used the ABC. It is even worse that the ABC allowed itself to be the Government's tool in this exercise, particularly when it had only a fraction of the material. What about the other 160 pages&mdash;indeed, the 400-odd pages that we have now seen today? Why did the Government not give that to the ABC?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the Government trying to hide in all this&mdash;given that the Treasury head, Tony Cole, the current head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and former Department of Finance Secretary, Mike Keating, and even the Prime Minister's own economist, Dr John Edwards, all back a goods and services tax? Treasury and the Prime Minister's Department wanted a goods and services tax back in 1985. There is only one conclusion to be drawn from all of that: the reason why there was a selective disclosure to the ABC last night was that the Treasury in fact backs Fightback, the coalition's set of proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, despite all its biases, conceptual errors and incorrect assumptions, the Treasury analysis contained in the document that the ABC had last night gives total endorsement&mdash;indeed, more than total endorsement if one can have such a thing&mdash;to the goods and services tax and to the measures proposed by the coalition to compensate age pensioners, welfare beneficiaries and other low income earners for the 4.4 per cent, one-off price impact of the introduction of a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document acknowledges that the coalition's compensation measures will be more than what is required to compensate for the one-off price effect. Let us have a look at what that price impact will be. On page 3 of its document, the Treasury says of its analysis of the Fightback proposals:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The analysis suggests that the total CPI impact of the introduction of the GST, the abolition of the wholesale sales tax, fuel excise and payroll taxes, and the changes to health care arrangements, is in the region of 4.6 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>That 4.6 per cent, it says, includes the increased cost of the health care arrangements and the increased cost to smokers of the higher tobacco prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has costed those items into the Fightback proposals, but it has not included them in the 4.4 per cent one-off price impact that we have said will result from the GST package. We have a 0.3 per cent impact on the consumer price index of the higher price to smokers and we have an increase in the CPI effect of 0.7 per cent for the change in our proposed health care arrangements. We admit those; they are said quite openly; we have said quite openly that we have made those changes to change the behaviour of the community by discouraging smoking and encouraging a much greater, more efficient use of the health resources of our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But those figures were not included in our calculation&mdash;deliberately so and openly so&mdash;of the price impact of the introduction of the GST. So the Treasury document of last night is saying&mdash;because those figures have to be taken off if we are going to compare like with like&mdash;that Treasury believes that the price impact of the coalition's proposals will be 3.6 per cent compared with the coalition's own estimate of 4.4 per cent. In other words, it has given us a better mark on the inflation stakes&mdash;the critical aspect that we thought the Treasury and the Government were really going to have a go at us on. We thought they would have said that our price impact assessment of 4.4 was too low. In fact, they are saying that it is too high and that we have dealt ourselves a bad card by saying 4.4. They say that it should be only 3.6. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button got it absolutely wrong today when he responded to Senator Reid's question on the price impact. Indeed, Senator Button's statements today, in his futile attempts to answer questions, were quite extraordinary. He got everything wrong that he attempted to answer. I find it absolutely incredible for Senator Button, one of the key economic Ministers in this Government, to say that he did not know whether the Government had made an assessment of the impact on income distribution of its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> document&mdash;the Government's economic statement of last week. It simply highlights the totally political nature of this exercise so far as the Government is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week's economic statement by the Government was not an economic statement; it was a blatantly political statement designed to try to buy votes before the Wills by-election in a couple of months. It was a desperate attempt by a desperate Prime Minister to claw up some support in the community for a deeply divided, rattled and desperate government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The internal inconsistencies in what the Government is saying are legion. As I have said, last night the Government showed that the Treasury analysis of the GST Fightback package was 3.6 per cent. Yet elsewhere in the document&mdash;and I will come to this a little later&mdash;when it came to try to cost the accuracy of the coalition's proposal to give back to taxpayers any additional revenue that is gained because of the effect of inflation on taxation rates, it used a figure of 6 to 7 per cent as an inflation rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a basic internal inconsistency there. Why has the Government used 6 to 7 per cent in one breath while admitting in another breath that the real figure of the coalition's measures is 3 to 3 1/2 per cent? Why did it use 6 to 7 per cent for this part of its costing exercise when the whole of its own economic statement is predicated on the basis of an inflation rate over the next three or four years of approximately 3 1/2 per cent? Why the different standards? Why the double standards? Again, one can come to only one conclusion: either this Treasury document was politically manipulated from outside or, if it was not, it contains some fundamental flaws that make it internally very inconsistent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key criticisms contained in the ministerial statement about the coalition's Fightback proposals relates to the question to which I have just referred of bracket creep; that is, the additional revenue that governments get because of inflation, taking taxpayers from one income tax bracket to a higher income tax bracket. Indeed, a large part of this Government's expenditure programs over the last seven or eight years has been funded simply through this insidious, unfair and inequitable device of bracket creep. This Government has ripped $22 billion off income tax payers in this country through bracket creep. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, in response to a question from me at Question Time, Senator Button admitted that there is no provision at all in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> document, the so-called economic statement of last week, to hand back any bracket creep at all by this Government. That answer will be in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I do not blame him. If he had not said that, he would have been telling an untruth because the economic statement does not have any provision in it at all for the handing back of bracket creep. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is in stark contrast to the coalition's Fightback proposals which have totally costed to the cent the handing back of bracket creep; it is included as an integral part of the coalition's proposals. We will legislate to ensure that bracket creep, this unfair tax take by the Government, is handed back to the taxpayers at the end of each financial year. What is more, that is fully costed. Indeed, that is another marked distinction between the Fightback proposals and the Government's proposals, because not in any context at all are the Government's proposals actually funded by other tax or expenditure measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasury document shoots down the Government beautifully on this very point. If we look at page 8 of the Treasury document that was used last night on the ABC, we find the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The return of bracket creep is therefore necessary to ensure that people do not pay a greater proportion of their income in tax solely because of inflation.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Treasury is saying that if a government is going to be fair it has to give back, it has to allow for, bracket creep. The Government denies the advice and the clear statement of its own Treasury on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the other area where the Government is totally vulnerable, and rightly so, in relation to its statement last week is in the area of tax cuts. It is absolutely incredible that a Labor government, a government that purports to represent the low income earner in our society, can dare to bring forward a so-called statement of hope for the future, the One Nation statement, which does not allow for one cent of income tax cuts for the 42 per cent of the Australian income tax paying population who earn less than about $20,700. Forty-two per cent of the total population have a taxable income of less than that amount. The Government's tax scales, which will not come in anyway until 1994 and 1996, do not provide any relief at all at that income level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, there is a major reduction in the proportion of income tax that will be paid under the coalition's Fightback proposals by low income earners up to that level, including the very low income earners, where we will raise the minimum exemption level, the minimum threshold, from $5,400 to $7,000, thereby exempting totally from the payment of income tax an additional several hundred thousand people who now pay it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make only a couple of other points because I want to leave time for my colleagues to participate fully in this debate. Back in 1985, the then Treasurer, now the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, made a very important statement. He was then the most ardent exponent of the very proposals that form the basis of the coalition's Fightback proposals, based around, although much wider than, the introduction of a goods and services tax. In 1985 Mr Keating said that the ideal solution in the reform of the tax system of this country would be the replacement of the wholesale sales tax with a goods and services tax and a capital gains tax and effective closure of major avenues for tax avoidance and minimisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cite that latter statement for a very important reason. Ever since Mr Keating was rolled on his goods and services tax proposal back in 1985, he has been trying to rewrite history by saying that Australia does not now need a goods and services tax because the Government has made changes in the capital gains tax area and has closed off other tax loopholes that existed at that time. His own words absolutely destroy that argument because he predicated the whole of his approach in 1985 on those things occurring in any case. One has to look only at the types of statements the very articulate exponent of the goods and services tax made in 1985, namely, Mr Keating, to know that his supposed opposition to the tax today is something that he does not believe in and, therefore, he has no credibility at all in relation to that proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document we have as the basis for our debate today, the ministerial statement by the Treasurer, is based on material supplied by the Treasury which is flawed. It is very surprising to see so many mistakes, both conceptual and otherwise, in a document provided by the Treasury. One can only speculate as to the reasons for that. We have a desperate Prime Minister, a desperate government, trying to rake up every scare campaign, every scare tactic, every mistruth, every misleading misrepresentation of the true situation in a desperate attempt to salvage a government which the Prime Minister himself and the Australian people know is going down the drain at a very great rate of knots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Dawkins, the author of today's statement, but more particularly the Prime Minister, know that they have blown their chance with the economic statement. The statement last week was supposed to give an honest assessment of Australia's economic difficulties and have the courage to make the structural reforms necessary to ensure sustainable growth and jobs. That statement last week showed no courage at all, no such realism, no such opportunity or hope for the future, and failed completely to provide any idea of where this visionless, desperate Prime Minister is trying to lead this country. It was a political statement designed to buy time for the Prime Minister. It was not what it should have been&mdash;a responsible economic statement. No attempt to mislead and deceive the Australian public about the content of the coalition's policies will ever change that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who on earth will believe this Prime Minister, this person who said there would never ever be a recession? He said that two days before the last election, knowing full well that as soon as the election was out of the way the recession would hit. He said in 1988, when he introduced his Budget, that it would not only bring home the bacon but that it would also be `the crowning glory of anything any government has ever produced'. Mr Keating is the man who completely got it wrong over 8 1/2 years as Treasurer. He is the man who produced the greatest misery and hardship for more Australians than this nation has seen in the last 60 years. He is trying now to convince the people of Australia that he has the answers for the future. He did not have the answers in the last nine years. There is no possible reason or expectation that he can have those answers for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This attack by the Government on the coalition's Fightback proposals is not only flawed but is also totally politically biased. I have no doubt at all that it will not stand up because the whole rationale for the attack has no legs, and it will increasingly be revealed that that is the case. Indeed, the extraordinary and very satisfying thing the coalition finds is that, despite the enormous resources the Government has poured into attacking the coalition's Fightback proposal, at great cost to taxpayers, because it is  all taxpayer funded&mdash;all this work, all this modelling that is going on in Treasury is being funded by the taxpayer&mdash;no fault has been found on any single significant count with that package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the Fightback package has captured the imagination of the Australian people. It shows vision, it is properly costed, and it is an accurate statement. As we go to the next election, the Australian people will continue increasingly to see that as the case and will compare it very starkly, and very bleakly so far as the Government is concerned, with that flawed political attempt last week to even the books&mdash;an attempt that I believe has failed quite miserably. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we are debating a ministerial statement from the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) which summarises the analysis by the Federal Treasury of the goods and services tax proposal incorporated in the Fightback package of the Liberals. We are not debating a whole range of side issues or diversions. We are not debating how the ABC somehow got hold of a copy of the analysis or whatever. We are debating what is in the ministerial statement and what is in the Treasury analysis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasury analysis of the distributional effects, the effects on real income distribution in Australia of the Fightback package, are illuminating and highly disturbing. This analysis by the Federal Treasury shows that the Liberal Party package is highly regressive, highly unfair, with the most resources in net terms going to high income earners. I stress at the outset that this study has not been done by the Government; it has not been done by the Executive Government of Australia. It has been done by the Treasury Department of the Australian Public Service. It should be treated on that basis and we should not get sucked into all the side issues, diversions and hares that Senator Short tried to run this afternoon about how the ABC somehow got hold of the contents of this or some other side issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This afternoon Senator Short tried to ignore the devastating findings of this independent analysis by the Australian Public Service, showing, for example, that as a result of the Fightback package of Dr Hewson some seven out of 10 full time wage and salary earners in Australia will be worse off and only three out of 10 will be better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the self-employed category in Australia&mdash;self-employed persons and farmers&mdash;on the Treasury analysis six out of 10 will be worse off and only four out of 10 will be better off. That is what will happen according to this thoroughgoing analysis of all the assumptions, all the underlying parameters, of the Opposition's package. Yet I recall that late last year when Dr Hewson announced this so-called Fightback package he said that everybody would win under it, everybody would be better off. These figures today nail that lie very conclusively indeed. Clearly, Dr Hewson was wrong. Clearly, he was misleading the Australian electorate when he said that everybody wins under the Fightback package. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not have a goods and services tax in our policy. We will get onto the distributional effects of this package in a moment. The reality is that we will not slug the products and services sold in the Australian economy with a 15 per cent value added tax. That is the thing that really creates the massive unfairness, the massive negative distributional effects of this Fightback package that we are looking at today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Hewson tried the old Liberal Party hardy of a fist full of dollars, the idea being that one wins elections by bribing the electorate with massive personal income tax cuts. That is, of course, what Malcolm Fraser tried in 1977. This is the centrepiece, it seems, of the Liberal Party's election strategy for the next Federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, when we look at the figures in this package, when we look at the details, we find that, allowing for the effect of the 15 per cent consumption tax in line with these personal income tax reductions, only households with taxable incomes above $40,000&mdash;and I did not say $14,000; I said $40,000&mdash;receive net benefits from the proposed Liberal Party package. Households with incomes above $40,000 are those which will be better off. In other words, those with incomes less than $40,000 will be worse off. Of course, if the Opposition's consumption tax were ever implemented, we would have to look at the effects of the massive kick start to inflation it would cause by cancelling out the personal income tax cuts for those with a taxable income of more than $40,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the top end of the distribution of income&mdash;say, incomes of $100,000 or more&mdash;we see that persons receiving those sorts of salaries receive double the compensation that they need for the price rises from the consumption tax under this package. The largest benefits go to those on the highest incomes in Australia. Of course, that is no surprise to most of us on this side of the Chamber. We know that the Liberal Party supports the big end of town. It supports those who earn high incomes. They are certainly the people who receive the biggest benefit out of this package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Treasury looked at the fine print of the Fightback package, when it looked at the details and the assumptions, it discovered that the Liberals had omitted some important elements from their own analysis of the impact of the package on the distribution of real income. There were several major areas omitted by the Liberals in this package which impacted significantly on the distribution of real income in Australia. The items that tended to be left out by the Liberals were, in fact, items which most hurt lower and middle income households. They tended to omit from their distributional analysis items in the package which would impact most negatively on lower and middle income households. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer, firstly, to expenditure cuts. The reality of government spending is that high income earners depend less on government spending for their welfare than lower income earners. High income earners do not rely so much on the Budget for their living standards as lower income earners. The Liberals are, in fact, proposing massive expenditure cuts in their package. Prima facie, one would expect that the impact of those expenditure cuts would be on the lowest income earners. In fact, even on the Liberal Party's own costings, some $6.5 billion worth of expenditure cuts has not really been taken into account in its own distributional calculations. Those cuts, essentially, were focused through social security transfer payments&mdash;income payments&mdash;to lower income households. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, of course, the Liberals have not properly costed bracket creep&mdash;the movement of wage and salary earners from one tax bracket into another as a result of wage increases. The actual increase in tax collections is $3 billion, a figure which was not fully taken into account by the Liberals in their assessment of the distributional effects on Australian households. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the individual expenditure cuts which have not been treated fully and significantly by the Liberals in their package, we look at items such as the removal of Medicare bulkbilling for most households. Obviously, that has distributional effects. The Liberals are also proposing a lower family allowance income test. That would have significant distributional effects. They are proposing a family income test for the dependent spouse rebate. Again, that would have an important effect on the distribution of real income in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line to all this is that the Treasury analysis is very conservative. That is the nature of the institution. That policy-making department of the Australian Public Service is, essentially, a fairly conservative institution. It has made a conservative analysis of the effect on Australian households of the Fightback package. The Treasury actually pointed out that its analysis would understate the number of households in Australia that would be worse off under that package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I pointed out at the beginning of my remarks, some seven out of 10 of all full-time wage and salary earners in Australia would be worse off under this Liberal package. What the Treasury analysis shows is that that is a very conservative figure. The figure is probably more than seven out of 10. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speaking before me this afternoon, Senator Short said that the Treasury analysis was flawed. I assume that he was using the word `flawed' with a `w' in it, but I must say, after listening to his speech, I believe that the Treasury document has certainly floored the Liberal Party&mdash;`floored' with a double `o'&mdash;because, clearly, it has set the Liberal Party on a path of running hares and creating diversionary tactics. The Liberal Party is trying to focus this debate on how the ABC got hold of the analysis, rather than on the real point here, which is the effect on the distribution of Australian income between households on different incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very floored Liberal Party we faced this afternoon as it tries to get out from under this assault by the Treasurer on its document, showing how unfair it is in terms of the distribution of income in Australia. We all know that the Liberal Party package is regressive anyway. We only have to look at the consumption tax to see how regressive a proposal it would be. The Liberal Party in this country is proposing a full-blooded value added tax. Nothing less than that; a full-blooded value added tax&mdash;</PARA>

They want a tax on consumption that is tougher than the value added tax that most persons born in the United Kingdom and living in Australia have come to know and dislike. The Liberals' tax proposal is much tougher than the value added taxes operated in countries overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I get onto the specifics of that, I might just point out that the Liberal Party wants to abolish the present system of the wholesale sales tax and then bring in this particular 15 per cent consumption tax. I point out, for example, that the present sales tax is very narrow. For example, it does not tax services. It focuses, essentially, on physical products. It is a selective tax, so that luxuries are taxed at a higher rate than basic necessities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might point out that the Australian Taxpayers Association, with Mr Eric Risstrom as its national director, has worked out that only about $1 in every $4 spent in the Australian economy at present is hit by the current sales tax. That is a fairly simple proposition&mdash;only $1 in every $4 spent in the Australian economy at present is affected by sales tax. Yet these people opposite want a 15 per cent tax on virtually everything&mdash;every physical product, every service, everything consumed in the Australian economy. Those are some of the points that we have to bear in mind when we look at this proposal of the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, the present system is selective to the extent that, since last week, it taxes ordinary passenger motor vehicles at the rate of 15 per cent. It has a selective rate of 30 per cent on luxury motor vehicles. So that tax is quite selective. In fact, it is hardly regressive when one looks at it in those terms. </PARA>

The tax that the Labor Government has in place, the sales tax, is levied at a rate of 30 per cent on items such as processed diamonds, jewellery and furs.

On the subject of food, it is interesting that the Australian Bureau of Statistics every three months monitors the price of 44 staple food items around Australia. It looks at a list of items which are consumed fairly heavily by Australian households. It is very illuminating that only two of the 44 items monitored by the Bureau face a sales tax. Therefore, 42 out of 44 food items which are regarded as key staple items by the Bureau of Statistics do not have a sales tax levied on them at present, but the Liberals would tax all those items at a rate of 15 per cent. It is interesting that virtually all food items consumed in the Australian economy would go up in price as a result of the Liberal Party proposal. There are only a couple of snack foods that would be affected in a different way under that Liberal proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the Liberals want a tax of 15 per cent on all goods and services; they want a tax at each stage of production. They would bring in the first Australian tax of a comprehensive nature on services. They would bring in a tax on gas bills and telephone bills, a tax on hairdressers, a tax on accountants as well as a tax on physical products consumed in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me take a typical telephone bill in my State of South Australia, which is $520 at present. The 15 per cent tax would increase that bill to $598. That is the sort of impact that the goods and services tax would have in the Australian economy. The Liberals are proposing a tax with a very broad base. They would give very few exemptions because they are desperate to maximise the revenue that they want from that tax. Virtually everything sold in the Australian economy would be taxed at a rate of 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting, in view of earlier interjections from Senator Kemp, to look at the Liberals' tax proposals in an international context. The value added tax imposed by the conservatives in the United Kingdom&mdash;the Tories, the ultra-right like Mrs Thatcher in that country&mdash;gave exemptions for food, gas and power bills, bus fares, children's clothes, books and newspapers. All those items were exempted from value added tax under the Tories, the right wing conservatives in the United Kingdom. However, the Liberals would tax all those items in Australia. Every one of those items would be within the tax net under this draconian, non-selective and inflexible proposal brought down by Dr Hewson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberals would tax food, gas and power bills, public transport fares, children's clothes and books and newspapers. Things like public transport fares and children's clothes are significant items in the budgets of lower and middle income households. We are talking today about the effects on the distribution of income and the real impact on household welfare, and a tax on things such as bus fares and children's clothes would impact significantly on lower income households in Australia. That is in the international context, making a comparison with the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at Canada, which is a country the Liberals looked at in coming out with their harebrained scheme. Again, in Canada there is an exemption for basic foodstuffs. The Canadian goods and services tax brought in about a year ago exempts basic foodstuffs. That is one way in which the Canadians have worked to ensure that the impact of the tax proposals on lower income and middle income households is reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us also look at some of the countries in continental Europe such as France, Germany and Switzerland. They do not have just a 15 per cent rate on everything as the Hewson Liberals would have&mdash;an inflexible, draconian, non-selective tax of 15 per cent on everything. In France, Germany and Switzerland the VAT systems have multiple rates, with a low rate on the basic necessities of life, the basic essentials consumed by households, which are often exempt from tax, and higher rates of tax on luxury goods consumed in those economies. But again in the international context we are seeing here under the Liberals a very non-selective, draconian and inflexible tax proposal which would hit every household with a 15 per cent tip for Dr Hewson every time people spend money at a supermarket or at some other shop in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all, it is a tax on spending, because that is what it is all about. Therefore, it hits those families who spend all or most of their income harder than other households. We all know which families spend all or most of their incomes. It is the lower and middle income households in our community. Every time a household is able to save a dollar of income, it is able to avoid the goods and services tax, but those households that spend all their income or more are paying tax on every dollar of that income. It is a much more draconian approach to taxation than is personal income tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very illuminating that low income earners in Australia spend a very high proportion of their incomes on food, clothing and services. That is the reality which is shown by the household expenditure studies and budget studies. But we know that at the moment those areas are tax free. They are free from sales tax.  No sales tax is levied on those areas by the Keating Government. </PARA>

I find it indefensible that the Opposition can propose the same rate of tax on margarine and Mercedes, the same rate of tax on yoghurt and yachts. There will be many complications as a result of the Opposition's proposal; there will be a number of weird price effects if the coalition ever gets into power. The Opposition will create a situation where luxury goods come down in price but the basic essentials&mdash;food, clothing and footwear&mdash;become more expensive for most households in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard the Liberals say, `Oh well, we shouldn't be too hung up on the distributional effects of our package because, after all, we are going to compensate households for our 15 per cent goods and services tax. We'll boost household payments through social security and we'll give personal income tax cuts to compensate households for the effect of our 15 per cent tax'. That is the rhetoric. I find it incredible that the Opposition expects the electorate to believe what it says. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at New Zealand. In 1986 the New Zealand Government&mdash;a Labour Government&mdash;went to the electorate and said, `Look, we need to bring in a 10 per cent consumption tax in New Zealand, but don't worry about it&mdash;we'll compensate you fully; we'll give you an increase in your social security payments. Don't worry about it, trust us. We'll cut your personal income tax if you are in the work force. Don't worry about it, we'll compensate you for any price rises occasioned by these particular taxes'. The electorate was sold that proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three years later the New Zealand Government announced to the electorate that it did not have enough money and that the tax rate had to be increased. The tax rate went from 10 per cent to 12 1/2 per cent in a three-year period. But was there any talk about extra compensation for the population? Was there any pledge by the Government there to increase social security payments? Was there any pledge to further reduce personal income taxes to compensate for the extra price rises? There was none at all. This is the great problem with these taxes: they are brought in as enormous panaceas by conservative politicians but time and time again the rates have been put up with no corresponding compensation for the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the United Kingdom under the Tories. When the value added tax was brought in in 1973 the rate was 10 per cent. When I last looked at the rate it was, I think, 17 1/2 per cent. Senator Kemp might like to correct me on that. My calculation is that in the 18 1/2 years that the VAT has been in operation in the United Kingdom the rates have been put up 75 per cent. </PARA>

I certainly do not believe that the Liberals would not boost the tax rate if ever they got in.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The bottom line is this: one of the differences between the One Nation package and the Fightback program is that we are prepared to cut government spending. We are prepared to cut the overall burden of taxation, which the Government is not prepared to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After we look very carefully at what the effects of the Fightback package will be on ordinary Australians, is it any surprise to find that it will deliver an average benefit of around $30 per week to Australian households? The Government's policies have, after all, been tested. It has been in office for nine years. We find that in this very long period of time it has cut the income of the average household by some $23 per week. We can see precisely what the Government's policies have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other matters raised by Senator Maguire I think merit some response. Australia happens to be one of the few countries in the world which does not have a consumption type tax; 21 out of 24 countries have a consumption tax. I believe that in the next 12 months it will rise to 22. There is a very good reason why this is the case. As Mr Keating pointed out in 1985, it is a very efficient and fair tax. Mr Keating's words will undoubtedly come back to haunt the Labor Party as this debate proceeds in future months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very glad that Senator Cook has come into the chamber. I have tried to have a continuing debate with Senator Cook on living standards of the Australian worker. I have found it very difficult to have that debate. Every time I put down some figures&mdash;I have done that, as Senator Cook would undoubtedly confirm, on a number of occasions&mdash;Senator Cook has chosen not to respond, despite the fact that some years ago he was one of the great boosters of how well this Government was doing to help the living standards of ordinary Australians. It is not only their living standards which the Government's policies have hit; the Keating-Hawke policies have actually taken away a lot of jobs. We now have one million people on the dole and `the recession'&mdash;these words again will come to haunt the Government&mdash;`that we had to have'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of this debate there will be a lot of comment, figures, statistics and assumptions thrown around.

He is a man who has so grossly distorted the truth during his term of office as Treasurer and we are seeing the same old habits again now he has managed to stab Mr Hawke in the back and take over. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's statement is just another piece of orchestration in the strategy of this Government to pretend that there are big differences&mdash;all of a sudden there are big differences again&mdash;between this Government and the Opposition. Mr Keating called it an enormous gulf. It is not true and the similarities are still quite staggering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next prong to this public relations strategy is to convince Australians, especially lapsed Labor voters, that Australia now has a born again Labor Party. We see Senator Button and others foisting the blame for this recession onto bureaucrats and onto Canberra in general. It is a strategy that seems to be working, but it is a fraudulent one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, Treasurer Dawkins released a massive amount of information which purports to destroy the Fightback package. Certainly, it aims to undermine public confidence in the costings and, predictably, the Opposition claims that much of Treasury analysis supports the Fightback policies and therefore its model is vindicated. This orchestrated debate into costings and flawed models will continue until the next election, by which time the community will be even further alienated from an understanding of basic economic process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that recent surveys have shown that the public does not understand the economic jargon in which we all indulge. It has come to dominate the political debate. The community does not want to hear endless technical debates about how packages are modelled or how various outcomes are related to scenarios and not forecasts, for example. Certainly, we do need to test new claims made, but this tendency to engage in this sterile discussion of computer modelling is further dehumanising the economy and the whole political process. It is just more of the pull-the-right-levers model. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst the 12 or so pages of the statement, I was able to glean some useful data. I think the Opposition's proposal for the GST, which will result in an increase in the price of dairy products, cereal products and fresh fruit and vegetables by 10 per cent and an increase in the cost of clothing by 11 per cent, will alarm most Australians. I would like to confirm to the Senate and the Australian people that the Australian Democrats have successfully opposed such taxes on the necessities of life before and we will continue to do so if we are placed in that situation following the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The speech of the Treasurer today correctly points out that the greatest impact of these increases will fall on low income families, and it is for that reason that the Democrats will never support the taxation of these necessities. The Government is also claiming that about three-quarters of all families will be worse off under Fightback. It says that the richest 10 per cent of the community will be better off and the rest of the community will have to pay. Clearly, such an outcome is blatantly unfair, and that is why the Democrats do not support a universal goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what the Government is offering low income earners in its One Nation statement. A member of a family with children will get a one-off bribe to buy a pair of shoes for one of the children and will then be eligible for an extra $3 per week in the family allowance supplement. The Government will provide people earning over $50,000 with an income tax cut of $47 per week, but people who earn under $20,700 will get no income tax cuts. That means that the Government is providing a totally regressive proposal to cut income tax. Where is the social justice for Mr Keating's cohesive nation in this action?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the Government and the Opposition wish to redistribute income towards the wealthy&mdash;Fightback by taxing the necessities of life and granting income tax reductions, and One Nation by granting income tax reductions to all income groups other than the lowest income group. There is no great gulf of difference in those two policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is similar about the two economic agendas? The first similarity is in the area of the financial sector. There is absolutely no difference between the policies of the Government and those of the Opposition in regard to bowing to the wishes of the financial community. Australia is about to have a new round of foreign banks commence business here. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> has already reported that some Greek and Dutch institutions wish to commence operations as soon as possible. Where is the clamour for more foreign financial institutions to operate in Australia coming from? It is not coming from the Australian people; they have little enough confidence in Australian banks after the excesses of the last decade. It is coming from the New Right bureaucracy, which still controls the political agenda in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have asked Senator Button in this place what ordinary Australians will gain from even more financial deregulation. He could not answer, because the answer is clearly: `Very, very little'. The banking issue that most people are concerned about is the totally regressive and unfair fees that are imposed at will by the banks. What do the others say? What do the Government and the Opposition say? They say, `Leave it to the market'. That is just what happened and that is why we are in this disgraceful mess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This secret alliance of similarity of policy extends also to the area of foreign investment. Again, yesterday Senator Button could not explain to the Australian people what the benefits are of the automatic approval of all foreign investment proposals of less than $50m. This is one of the worst decisions of this Labor Government. The history books will record this policy as a key part of the decline in the prosperity of the Australian nation. This decision will allow our rural sector and our tourism sector to become completely foreign owned. Nearly all the profits will flow overseas and we will become completely beholden to foreign landlords. This is the ultimate financial cultural cringe. Why should we not actively support Australian investment in Australia instead of constantly grovelling, cap in hand, to foreign countries?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are so many other areas where ideology is paramount over commonsense. For example, the Government has taken up the basically `open skies' aviation policy of the Opposition. The Opposition is proposing to tighten further the targeting which now controls our social support structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the greatest conspiracy, or the greatest tragedy, the greatest sell-out of the Australian people, is the completely impotent response of both the Government and the Opposition to the extremely serious problem of unemployment, and in particular the level of youth unemployment, which has reached the level of the Great Depression and is over 40 per cent in some parts of Victoria. Both the Government and the Opposition have agreed that these people have to obtain `real' jobs. That means that the Government is not allowed to step in and provide community-based work during the periods when there are no job opportunities in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter is the true tragedy of the alliance of the similarity in policy between the Government and the Opposition. The unemployed will not get any opportunity. The Government is hoping to reduce unemployment to only 7 per cent in four years, and this is based on the ridiculously optimistic assumption of constant growth of 5 per cent over the next four years. The Opposition wants to halve the rate of unemployment by the end of the decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final page of the Treasurer's speech contains a statement which is supposed to sum up Australia after we have all experienced the brilliance of the One Nation statement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition promised that everyone would be a winner out of its so-called Fightback package. We have heard that statement time and time again from those opposite. When one looks at the Treasury analysis that has been presented by Treasurer John Dawkins, nothing could be further from that very simplistic notion and statement. The Treasury analysis shows that those persons earning over $90,000 a year will be between $15 and $105 a week, or $5,460 a year, better off. Persons earning a gross income of under $57,000 a year&mdash;approximately 70 per cent of the population&mdash;will be $8 a week worse off, or approximately $400 a year. So, I reiterate: how is everyone a winner?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite were honest and frank about the issues before us, they would have to admit that it is literally impossible for everyone to be a winner in an economy which is contracting and, even on the Opposition's projections, is likely to continue to have slow growth for the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What interests me in this debate is how touchy those opposite have become. Whilst they touched on the issues from time to time, we have had a tirade against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Those opposite have attacked the methodology that has been applied to the Treasury's study. They have wrapped it up in all sorts of rhetoric about lies and untruths. It just shows how touchy those opposite have become. I think they have finally realised that their arrogance and their assumption that they were a shoo-in at the next election is fast evaporating. One only has to look at their own faces over the last week to realise that they are in for one hell of a fight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this theme, I take up some of the criticisms that Senator Kernot has made. One thing on which we on this side of the Senate can agree with those opposite is that there are some very stark contrasts between the policies that are being presented through the Fightback and One Nation policies. One only has to look at the approaches that we are adopting to taxation reform, superannuation, health insurance and industrial relations. I do not know how the Democrats can maintain that our approaches are similar. That is simply not correct. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a range of other areas, but these are certainly pretty fundamental to the welfare of Australians generally. In terms of the Treasury analysis of the Fightback package, the Opposition has tried a very clever trick, and at last it has been caught. It has tried to convince everyone that they will be at least $30 a week better off. But, of course, what the Opposition is fudging is the fact that, even if people were $30 a week better off, there is a whole range of services that individuals would have to provide for themselves. If we take those sorts of services into account&mdash;such as health insurance, superannuation and bracket creep, which is a major cover-up by those opposite&mdash;as well as the effects of the $6.5 billion cuts in expenditure which are likely to affect those on lower incomes to a great degree, overwhelmingly we can see why 70 per cent of people in this country would be worse off under the Fightback package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cite the example of superannuation. I am the Chair of  the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, which is examining that matter. There is not a great deal of support for two of the principal changes that the Opposition proposes. There is not a great deal of support for so-called voluntarism in superannuation. What is being proposed in the Fightback package is to freeze the compulsory element of superannuation at 5 per cent when, in fact, contributions of at least 12 to 15 per cent are needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Opposition again fudged the issue very nicely by claiming that it was providing incentives for people to take out superannuation by changing the tax arrangements and by allowing a rebate of up to $6,000 a year. But, if one is an average wage earner&mdash;and the majority of the population in this country earns less than $35,000 a year&mdash;and one is hit with a 15 per cent consumption tax, and required to pay an extra 10 per cent of one's income into a superannuation fund to provide a decent retirement income, as well as being required to pay for health insurance, where is the benefit? This is the great con of the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package also makes some other assumptions which are quite clearly wrong. In respect of the inflationary effect, for example, there is an assumption that every business that currently pays wholesale sales tax will reduce its prices by the amount of the reduction in the wholesale sales tax. Who is the Opposition kidding? Does it seriously believe that the business sector will take out the wholesale sales tax component of the prices it charges and reduce its prices? Of course it will not. That sort of factor has to be taken into account when making assumptions on the inflation rate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot's accusation that we are not addressing the problems that lower income families face is untrue. Over the last eight years we have provided significant tax changes for that group of people in our community. In this document we have also targeted special assistance to families. The Government is also proposing, as part of the One Nation package, to tackle the severe infrastructure problems that this country faces in terms of roads, rail and ports. We are also proposing to tackle the significant education and training problems that this country faces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summation, the policy that has been put forward by those opposite is a recipe for disaster. It is a recipe for a divided nation&mdash;a nation where the strong will exploit the weak. It is a recipe for an increase in inflation, interest rates, unemployment and a declining economy, a la New Zealand. We have a perfect working example in New Zealand&mdash;and I use the word `working' very loosely when describing New Zealand because that country's whole economy is falling apart. The Opposition boasts that this is what it wants to introduce into the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, the One Nation package offers us hope. In terms of the tourism industry, which I highlighted earlier, the Government has introduced improved capital write-offs over 25 years, not 40 years. We have extended the structural changes that can be taken into account for improved write-offs to include roads and other areas of infrastructure. We have accelerated the depreciation rate to 20 per cent for fittings, air-conditioning plants and furniture in the tourism industry. So the Government has very carefully targeted an industry that has very substantial long term growth prospects. Along with those measures are our aviation reforms. The tourism industry is a good example of what the Government has been doing and what we intend to do, which is in total contrast to those opposite who intend to absolutely implode the hospitality industry and destroy any job prospects. </PARA>

Fuel excise will be abolished, customs duty phased out, and depreciation provisions reviewed. These policies without doubt plan to create a new business climate where small business is no longer treated by government as a second class citizen.

GST on most business operating costs will be refunded in full. No business input costs will incur tax, and that is a very big break for the business community. Small business will receive significant cash flow advantages from GST funds on business inputs. Tax deductibility on capital equipment because of the GST will be of particular benefit to small businesses who use the opportunity of the tax changeover to upgrade or to move to computer accounting.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us see what Mr Dawkins has to say in trying to bail out his friend Mr Keating, because it is very interesting politics.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us do a quick analysis of how the Treasury has managed to distort the figures in the coalition's tax reform package. I can do no better than quote the Treasury. In document No. 2 there is a long diatribe by Treasury, which says this about expenditure changes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A complete analysis of the distributional effects of the Opposition's package would require that the effects of all the Opposition's proposed changes be distributed to households. That would require that account be taken of&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>inter alia, all expenditure changes, all tax changes, policy changes and bracket creep. It goes on to say that it does not intend to do so. So all the big savings to this nation's economy that the coalition has proposed, all the big savings in cutting $20 billion off taxation in this nation, have been conveniently left out of the Treasury analysis. That is great! That is like starting a 100 metre dash with one leg amputated. It really is quite ludicrous. Then it goes on to say in respect of the other aspects of the expenditure changes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it is not possible to impute to households the impact of all expenditure cuts and revenue measures, the Treasury analysis has taken into account&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and it lists a number, including the introduction of the proposed family income test, lowering the income test threshold for family allowance and so on. The Treasury has looked at all of the ways in which some people may have less money in their pockets and said, `That will be the same for everybody from one end of this country to the other, no matter what sector of the economy they are in'. The Government has amputated one of the legs of the runner and has put a ball and chain around the other, got the gun and said, `Now go'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That will not do. We are all a little bit too intelligent for that. I do not believe anybody in this country will really take this analysis seriously. But in case they do, in case they are foolish enough to believe what Mr Dawkins and Mr Keating&mdash;the failed Treasurer and now Prime Minister of this country&mdash;have to say, let us look at one simple fact. In its analysis of the coalition's package, Treasury has said that inflation between now and the introduction of our reforms will be 6 per cent to 7 per cent. That is very interesting because last week, according to the Prime Minister, inflation was going to be 3.5 per cent between now and 1994. So we have Treasury on one side saying that between now and 1994 inflation will be 7 per cent and on the other side we have the Prime Minister saying, `Listen, I am such a great bloke that between now and 1994 inflation will be 3.5 per cent'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Which one will we believe? Will we believe the gobbledegook from the failed Treasurer and now Prime Minister of this country or will we believe what Treasury has to say? We will believe one or the other, or maybe neither.

That saying applies equally to this Government as it does to all other people who do not wish to tell the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously the Government has to tell us, it has to somehow work out, how to correlate the 7 per cent inflation figure offered by the Treasury and the 3.5 per cent inflation figure offered by the Prime Minister. If the Treasury figure is correct, if 7 per cent is the inflation rate between now and 1994, then every single expenditure item in the Prime Minister's One Nation statement will be wrong as well. It will be wrong by 3.5 per cent per annum, and it will be wrong by 7 per cent between now and 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Clearly the Prime Minister needs to go back and do his homework.

It will be recalled that when the tax reform package came out, the former Prime Minister of this country, Mr Hawke, tried to scare everybody by saying that the coalition would introduce massive road user charges that were not included in the tax reform package. What the former Prime Minister was referring to, of course, was the Government's own proposal for increasing road user charges in this country, which the Government took to the Special Premiers Conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I need not remind honourable senators that the Government is proposing to increase the road user charges on every single heavy vehicle in this country by up to $14,400 per annum. These were the figures that the former Prime Minister attributed to the Opposition. Of course, the fact that that was not the case was totally irrelevant to Mr Hawke, his Cabinet Ministers and the aNiMaLS who ran around the Press Gallery, lying to people. It was also totally irrelevant to Mr Hawke and his Cabinet Ministers and aNiMaLS, who again ran around the Press Gallery lying to people, that the coalition in fact opposed the Government's proposed legislation to implement those increased charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But here is the real rub about the lies from the former Prime Minister. The analysis that the Treasury made of the hypothetical increase in road user charges was based on the false assumption that the coalition  would introduce an increase in road user charges of $2,238 per annum&mdash;a figure plucked out of the air with no basis for it. Even if that analysis were right, there is a huge difference between that figure and the Government's own figure of $14,400 for every single heavy vehicle in this country, a figure which Mr Hawke was touting around the Press Gallery and blaming on the Opposition, while not having the honesty to say that that was what the Government was going to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the model that the Treasury people have put together there are some serious flaws in the way they have calculated the necessity to increase road user charges by $2,238 per annum per heavy vehicle. The major flaw is, of course, that the Treasury people, scratching around desperately to try to find a bit of muck to throw, decided that they were going to blur the distinctions as to how we fund the roads in this nation. They said, `We will allocate a certain amount of money every year to highways and Commonwealth road funding, but that is not good enough for the purpose of this model. We are going to take all the Commonwealth Government expenditure&mdash;which in 1991 was $1 1/2 billion&mdash;and we are going to add to that the $3.2 billion that the States and local governments spend on roads, put it all in one bundle, and say that Dr Hewson and the coalition are going to raise all of that through increased road user charges'. Nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even assuming that that is correct, the Treasury then goes on to make an analysis of the increase in costs to industry from having an increase in road user charges of $2,238 per heavy vehicle. Now, this is the really fascinating stuff. It says that the price of dairy products would increase by 0.72 per cent; the price of cereal products would increase by 0.82 per cent; and the price of meat and seafood would also increase by 0.71 per cent because of transport. What the Treasury does not say is that the Government's own increases in road user charges are three to four times the figures used in this model. If the Government goes ahead with its proposed increases in road user charges, the increase in the price of dairy products will not be 0.72 per cent, it will be 2.1 to 2.9 per cent. The increase in cereal products will not be 0.82 per cent, but will be something in the vicinity of 2.4 to 3.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we can find some truth in the figures the Government has come up with. The only truth in the figures that the Government has come up with is the truth about its shambolical plan to increase road user charges in this nation.

It has said, `Somebody over here is spending money; State governments and local governments are raising money. Let us expect the coalition to have to raise that as well'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason we are here today is to debate the ministerial statement, which I think it is fair to say was brought on because the honourable member for Flinders, my colleague Mr Peter Reith, used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain the analysis by the Treasury of the coalition's Fightback package, which was launched last November and which was so well received by the Australian electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that the reason the Fightback package was well received, and is still being well received, is not that everyone out there in the electorate knows the fine detail of the 700 pages and the substance and quality of the package. They know the broad details, they know that it faces up to the problems we have with our tax system. Not all of them know the fine detail of the package, but what they do know is that Australia is in deep trouble at the moment and that there is a need for a change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also fair to say that the positive response that Mr Keating and those opposite have received for their One Nation statement in the last couple of days&mdash;for example, in the poll published today&mdash;is also a reflection of the deep despair within the Australian community and the yearning for some sort of change. When Dr Hewson launched his Fightback package there was a ready acceptance of a detailed package. To a lesser extent when Mr Keating, the Prime Minister, launched the response, the One Nation statement last week, there was a perception that it had firmed up some support among the hard core of Labor voters who have been very disillusioned with the Labor Party since the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are here today to debate the ministerial statement in relation to the Treasury's analysis of the Opposition's policies. The Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, who was at the table a few minutes ago, asked my colleague Senator Olsen to debate the substance of the proposal. I refer to the statement of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). Page 3 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fightback is like the cities built for Catherine of Russia: all facade and no substance.</PARA>
<PARA>This comes from the Treasurer who is part of the Government which brought us the better cities program&mdash;a program which basically throws money at the cities, a program which is something that the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Howe, thought up when he was in the shower one morning when he was trying to figure out how he could put something into statement No. 18 from this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One only needs to look at the size of the response from Treasury. We are assured that this is not all of the response; a lot of it is still being kept secret from the Australian people, even though they are paying the taxes to fund the Treasury response. It is a document of probably 1,000 pages, if not more. Indeed, it is a document of more substance than the Federal Government's Budget of last year. There are more pages to it than there were to the Budget&mdash;there are certainly more than in the One Nation statement. It is bigger than <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback! </EMPHASIS>itself&mdash;and that is saying something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very size of these briefing papers provided to the Treasurer and the Treasury's analysis of them is of some substance. Clearly, the Government in its wisdom would not waste the resources of Treasury over many months and many late nights, spending many millions of dollars of taxpayers' money, analysing what Mr Dork&mdash;Mr Dawkins&mdash;has referred to as a policy of all facade and no substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> is full of substance because the Opposition parties have faced up to Australia's very real problems. We have heard today that our gross foreign debt&mdash;indeed, our foreign debt problem&mdash;has increased again and that we are going down the Argentine road. As we all know in this chamber, in 1983 we had a debt to the rest of the world of around $20 billion, and as we talk today that debt is over $135 billion. We know that nearly one million people are out of work and there are probably even more people around Australia who would be in the work force if they thought they had any hope. The real unemployment crisis is probably even much higher than that one million figure which the Opposition parties have become used to quoting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that during the Great Depression we had a very severe unemployment problem. The Government assures us that unemployment is not quite as bad now as it was then. If we analyse it&mdash;Senator Kernot referred to this during her contribution to the debate&mdash;youth unemployment, a crisis in Australia because we have disinherited an entire generation, is higher now than it was in the Great Depression. It is worse now for young people than it was back in 1932. I am sure that all of us who went through school and studied the years of the Great Depression and looked at the photographs of it&mdash;some of the people around here may have even lived through the Great Depression, I certainly did not&mdash;could never envisage this great nation ever sliding into the economic malaise that Australia suffered during the 1930s. The prospects for a young person growing up at the moment are worse than they were then. We have those problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As most Australians know, we have a tax system that does not encourage people to work harder. Indeed, the harder people work the more they get taxed and the less they take home. People just give up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an industrial relations system that basically keeps people out of work. We have an industrial relations system which keeps young people out of work. We have an industrial relations system that ensures that wages, salaries and conditions take no account of the conditions at the workplace. For example, an employer in a pub down at Kwinana, an industrial town south of Perth, is forced to pay his workers the same amount that the  Sheraton is forced to pay its people up at the Mirage Resort in Port Douglas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a telecommunications system which the business community knows is very inefficient and overpriced. In a nation as large as Australia we have a telecommunications system which is not world competitive. We live in a region where telecommunications services and the demand for them is rising every day, which has enormous market potential for Australia. Of course, this Government goes from having a monopoly system to having a duopoly and stops competition again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a waterfront that, despite the best efforts of the Minister for Shipping and Aviation (Senator Collins) and this Government to reform it, has done nothing to achieve gains as far as the costs of getting things out of Australian ports and into Australian ports is concerned. We have a monopoly on labour, we have a monopoly on the management of ports and we have a virtual monopoly in relation to the handling of the ships. </PARA>

We must take this debate back to the people, instead of talking about people who are $3 worse off, $5 better off, $15 better off or $20 worse off. The real issue for Australia is how we can get Australia out of the mess that this Government has plunged it into and how we can do that in a way that adjusts what we have at the moment so that people are not dislocated in the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback package does that. It makes reforms to the tax system and compensates people for the dislocation caused by that reform. We cannot move from an old ramshackle tax system where there are winners and losers, to a tax system which is fairer, without having some dislocation. Of course, the Fightback reform seeks to compensate people for that dislocation and seeks to ensure that those who have no way of protecting themselves from those changes are compensated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to what the Government says and contrary to what the Treasurer, Mr Dork&mdash;sorry, Mr Dawkins&mdash;says, the people on the lower incomes, people on fixed incomes, people on pensions are overcompensated. I am sure that my colleague Senator Bishop will reinforce that and, indeed, point to some places in the Treasury analysis that support the Opposition's view in that assumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback package also seeks to make changes in all of these areas of structural reform and micro-economic reform which this Government has been struggling with for eight years and has made no progress on. It does not really matter if we have the shiniest, brand new railway system and the shiniest, brand new rolling stock leading from Brisbane to Perth if the work practices, the business practices and the business tax system are not world competitive. Nothing in the Prime Minister's statement of last week changes anything as far as the efficiency of Australia's transport and telecommunications system is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Government for the changes to the depreciation system. I commend the Government for the progress it has made in some of the areas. We cannot go two paces down the road to reform for Australia because Australia is in a deep mess at the moment&mdash;it needs sweeping reform, it does not need fiddling at the edges. Australians know that. All of the analysis of Australia's economic mess points to one fundamental need; that is, there need to be more exports, more production and less government spending. The Treasury can spend all the time it likes trying to analyse our proposals, looking at the impact of 150 different deciles on all sorts of different people. The bottom line is that our tax reform involves some very fundamental basics that anyone sitting around the lounge room table could work out on the back of an envelope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tax reform should mean that we reduce the impact of tax overall. Our tax reform package moves from a direct income taxation system, which of course acts as a disincentive, to an indirect system. In the meantime, the package also includes $10 billion net in cuts to government expenditure. So overall taxation should come down. That is the bottom line that people need to work out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our package is also pro-business and pro-export. As I have said, Australia needs to achieve some major changes in these areas. We need to ensure that Australia is competitive internationally so that we can export more than we import and provide new job opportunities. I suggest to the Senate that these job opportunities will not be found by bureaucrats sitting in Canberra trying to pick winners in industry. They have been hopeless at doing that in the past. These opportunities will be found by private enterprise in a free enterprise sector that has the incentive to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that Australia has the potential to create the two million jobs, if not more, that the Fightback package allows it to do. We need to ensure that we are pro-development, that we encourage exploration for minerals, that we encourage entrepreneurship and that we encourage innovation in industry so that we can tap into these markets. We need to ensure that we have a tax system that encourages people to do that. The narrow focus of the technocrats and the bureaucrats in Canberra on the details of whether people are $3 a week worse off or $5 a week better off is interesting to those who want to sit in an office thousands of miles away from the unemployed, figuring out which model to use, but bears little relevance to those in need. </PARA>

This compares with Mr Keating, who has made promise after promise to the Australian people and, after hundreds of promises, has broken just about every one of them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to join the debate on our response to the ministerial statement of the man who purports to be Treasurer. Indeed, as we look at the sorts of things that have been said by the Government, there is much to put straight on the public record. A place to begin is to say that the Fightback package had two guiding aims: logic and equity. They are reforms which are designed to make our taxation system logical and to make it more equitable in determining who it affects and the way in which people invest and save. So although the goods and services tax is a central element of the Fightback package, the package has many more elements to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we are having a ministerial statement is that we sought, very properly, to ascertain the documentation on the extent of the work of a party political nature that public servants have been forced to do by the Government. We first became aware of the fact that the Government was forcing public servants to carry out party political work in the Estimates hearings in September of last year. We had the statement from Mr Smith, who is a First Assistant Secretary, dealing with Mr Kerin's instructions to him to set up a new model to test the goods and services tax and other indirect taxes&mdash;patently and obviously political in nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable senators want, in Treasury's own words, a statement of how it is under the thumb of the government of the day, a reading from its own Treasury annual report sets it out very nicely. Under the heading `The Treasury Portfolio&mdash;Role of the Department'it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The corporate role of the portfolio is to advise and assist in the management of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say, under a section called `The Year in Focus&mdash;The Economic Programs':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Treasury's advice to the Treasurer and the Government is to be relevant and timely, the Department needs to have regard to the priorities and policy framework of the Government of the day.This is in the context of the current and prospective economic situation both domestically and internationally.</PARA>
<PARA>So Treasury, in its own annual report, says that it must have regard to the priorities and the policy framework of the government of the day. Then it goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through a combination of factors&mdash;some domestic and some international&mdash;the recession proved to deeper than expected. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Is that not amazing? The basis of the diatribe we have had from Mr Dawkins today is that we are supposed to accept Treasury's assessment as being accurate and impartial. It fails on both counts. On its own admission, in its own annual report, it tells us how it got the assessment wrong and it tells us how it is its job to get it right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let us have a look at the extent of the errors that Treasury made in its advice to the Government which the Government accepted in its projections for the year 1990-91. Then we will have a look at why we use the actual figures for 1990-91 as distinct from any of the Government's estimates. All Budgets are, are guesses&mdash;learned guesses, guesstimates; call them what you will. They are nonetheless estimates and guesstimates. It is not until we get one year's actual figures that we have any hard data to work from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let us have look at how Treasury got it wrong in its own government Budget with regard to outlays and revenue for the year 1990-91. It got it wrong for social security and welfare by 3.4 per cent of Budget estimates; in other words, it got it wrong by nearly $1 billion. It got industry development and assistance wrong by an upward estimate of 49 per cent. It failed miserably on assets sales. It got that wrong by 83.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, the Treasury had a total error of 3.3 per cent in the amount of outlays that it thought it would have to make. That is a figure in the vicinity of $3 billion. With regard to the revenue&mdash;that is, how much it thought it would collect&mdash;it got wrong by 8.1 per cent the amount of PAYE tax it thought it would collect . In other words, it collected in excess of $3 billion less than it thought it would. Other income tax, which largely covers provisional tax, it got wrong by a further 6.8 per cent. These are all expressed as a percentage of Budget figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasury got company tax wrong; it also got wholesale sales tax wrong by a massive 12.2 per cent. Its total error in the amount of revenue it estimated it would receive was 3.1 per cent. In other words, the error it made is large, comprehensive and shows very simply that it does not meet the criteria set down today by Mr Dawkins that we should accept what Treasury has to say because it gets it accurate. Well, it does not, and it admits that it does not. In the overall estimates, expressed as a percentage of total Budget figures, there is an error of 76.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we go from expecting a massive surplus of $8.1 billion and it turns out to be $1.8 billion, we ask ourselves, `Do these people in Treasury really know their business?'. These are the same people who advised Mr Keating that we would not have a recession, that we would have a soft landing, that it was fine to fiddle around with the interest rates policy, as he did, using it in a political way when he saw fit&mdash;like trying to help Barry Unsworth win an election. He could not use any fiscal policy because his hands were bound by the accord with which this Government has been so incestuously concerned over its period in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see that the Treasury meets neither the criterion of accuracy nor the criterion of impartiality. As I said, in terms of its own statement, in order that its advice should be relevant and timely the Department needs to have regard to the priorities and policy framework of the government of the day. What are the priorities and the policy framework of this Government? They are, first, to dissociate itself from its 1985 commitment to introduce a consumption tax; and secondly, to try to discredit the Fightback package, which was introduced last year by Dr Hewson and which has been enormously well received by the people of Australia, who say things like, `I think it's good for the country'; `I'm not so interested in how it is for me individually, but something has to be done'. The way in which the Fightback package has been received is an indication of the sentiment of Australians, who simply feel that they have been done in by a government that has not levelled with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we turn to Mr Dawkins's statement we find that he has made public servants do party political work and that their estimates, just like the estimates they used for the Budget, are capable of being wrong and, indeed, are wrong, as has been shown with its estimate work for the 1991 Budget. Just as that is so, Mr Dawkins cannot even misuse the information with any degree of authority himself. If we compare page 4 of his statement with page 14 of the document used by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I will deal with that in a moment&mdash;called `Distributional Implications of the Opposition's Tax and Expenditure Package', we find that there is a fundamental error in the way Mr Dawkins quotes the Treasury instrument. Table 4 of the Treasury document says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comparison of Opposition's tax cut with true effect of tax scale after allowing for the CPI effect of package and bracket creep: ($ per week)</PARA>
<PARA>It then sets out the figures. Amongst those figures there is an income of $30,000 a year, the Opposition tax cut, the compensation tax cut and the true effect. It then has a note (a), which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This analysis concentrates on the income tax cuts only&mdash;it does not include the effect of increases in the level of transfer payments, changes in the eligibility conditions for transfer payments, or other tax and expenditure changes.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what it says in the Treasury document. What does Mr Dawkins say? Perhaps Senator Campbell is right in saying that he is `Mr Dork'&mdash;Mr Dawkins. In his statement he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, the Treasury analysis shows that, under the Opposition's preferred Scenario C, on the tax measures alone&mdash;that is, not factoring in any other changes&mdash;all people paying tax on incomes below $40,000 a year would not be adequately compensated both for bracket creep and for the price effect of the Opposition's package.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is a fraudulent and false representation of what the Treasury document says. I had a great deal of sympathy for people who worked in Treasury and in the Tax Office during the Estimates hearings when we were asking Mr Smith, the First Assistant Secretary, about the manner in which he was instructed to build this model. I had some sympathy for them because they really did not have any option. They said, for instance, that it was useful that they had done work on it in 1985 and they could re-use some of that information and that Mr Kerin had given them a date of September to have it completed but they really could not match it. Then I found a little note to Senator McMullan saying, `We really haven't got it up and working yet'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short and others have continually asked for an overall costing of what it has cost the taxpayer to do this party political work, with overtime payments made to people in the Treasury Department to feed the Fightback package through the model specifically built for this purpose. Mr Smith admitted that it was a new model; it was not the model used for the 12 March statement. It is not, presumably, the model used for doing the Budget figuring, where I have shown Treasury gets it wrong. It was a very special model built for the direct purpose of trying to discredit the Federal coalition's Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to look at a couple of the quotes from the Estimates hearings. We even got a decent definition of what is a model. If I can find it, I will read it; if I cannot, I will publish it later. It basically says that it is a device which is used to feed in behavioural patterns within an economy. It is this particular device that is then used to project the anticipated costs and effects within the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been much discussion concerning the Murphy model of Access Economics that was used largely by the coalition. There have been some disgraceful statements by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), trying to put into Mr Murphy's mouth statements that he did not make. There has been a concerted effort by the Labor Party to run the great lie. There is that old adage, well used by Senator Walsh for a long time, that if we run the great lie often enough and we have it published often enough, someone might believe it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we come to last night's contribution to the great lie&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program and the ABC. How many honourable senators sitting here remember Senator Evans standing up the other day to dissociate himself from the decision of the ABC to run <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Turtle Beach</EMPHASIS> because it will offend our foreign policy? How many honourable senators remember the number of times he has stood up and said, `The ABC is at arm's length. We cannot influence what it does or what it says'? Yet last night the ABC was used as an instrument of government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I asked Senator Button, the Leader of the Government in this place, whether he would tell us why the document was leaked to the ABC so that it could use it in its scripting; and if he could not explain why and how it was leaked, whether he would give a guarantee that the document did not come from the Government, its Ministers or any of its staff. What was his answer to this significant question? Very cleverly, he said, `I am convinced Treasury did not do it'. Indeed, I think I would be prepared to accept that, because the people in Treasury are decent folk. They do not like what this Government is doing through them, so much so that in the Estimates hearing when I asked for the reports that had been commissioned by the Australian Taxation Office at the behest of the Government to look into the wholesale sales tax system, I expected I would not ever see them.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a period of declining real wages, how far does Dr Hewson propose further to reduce them to enable Australian labour costs to compete with Chinese or Indonesian?

It is of some concern that the Opposition's Fightback package is such a radical document. We on this side of the chamber sometimes become concerned at the radical nature of the proposals made by the Opposition. I think it is that sort of thing that struck Mr Santamaria when he was moved to make the statement he did, which I quoted before the dinner break. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Santamaria's statement arose out of the traditions from which he came and the philosophy he adopted. They are to be found in a number of papal encyclicals. It is interesting to see what they say about unions and the necessity for them. I do not suggest for one minute that the Opposition should rely on statements or philosophies that have the blessing of papal authority. Nevertheless, I think it is something to take into account, for us on this side of the chamber, when we are looking at what ought to be the appropriate direction for this country to take in the future, what sort of policies it ought to adopt and where it ought to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my thinking that the people of Australia will be keen to stick to the traditional ways in which we have conducted the affairs of this nation in the past and which, by and large, have served us well, particularly in that dimension of society where the trade unions have played such a great and mighty part. To use a hackneyed phrase, it is more in sorrow than in anger that we on this side of the chamber note what, in the circumstances, can only be called a vicious attack that is to be perpetrated on the union movement through the workings of the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One hundred years ago Pope Leo XIII, in his encyclical <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rerum Novarum</EMPHASIS>, talked about the benefit of `helpful organisations'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most important of all are Working-men's Unions; for these virtually include all the rest. History attests what excellent results were brought about by the Artificers' Guilds of olden times. They were the means of affording not only many advantages to the workmen, but in no small degree of promoting the advancement of art, as numerous monuments remain to bear witness. Such Unions should be suited to the requirements of this our age&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>of course, this was 100 years ago&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">an age of wider education, of different habits, and of far more numerous requirements in daily life. It is gratifying to know that there are actually in existence not a few associations of this nature, consisting either of workmen alone, or of workmen and employers together; but it were greatly to be desired that they should become more numerous and more efficient.</PARA>
<PARA>I simply point out that this was a very eminent figure of 100 years ago encouraging the increase in strength of the unions, whereas in this Fightback package, this radical document, quite the opposite is proposed. It is a matter of regret that the Fightback package should be so centred upon destroying this great institution of unionism. I think it would be fair to say that Mr John Howard, who is the shadow Minister for industrial relations, does not go as far as his Leader in trying to put down the unions. Nevertheless, the general thrust from the coalition side is to try to break down this great guardian of workers' rights. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that although the expression `garbage in, garbage out' has been around for perhaps 15 years, we find that in this chamber at least and in many of the comments which are made outside this chamber by members of the chamber and, indeed, by many, although not all, of the economic commentators, there seems to be a too ready acceptance that what comes out of a computer is factual and reliable and can be used as the basis of argument as to whose package is the best or whose package will deliver a better result for the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such is not the case. The assumptions which are fed into these computer models are, even in terms of commonsense, manifestly stupid. To argue whether the Murphy model&mdash;on which the Fightback package is substantially based and on which the Government has based part of its attempt to discredit the Fightback package&mdash;will produce 4 per cent, 3 per cent or 2 1/2 per cent inflation so many years out into the future, is simply waving useless words in the air when the assumptions on which the models are based, as I will show, are demonstrably so completely without any foundation at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several of the economic journalists who have picked up the absence of substance in the computer models are Ken Davidson writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> and Peter Hartcher writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. It is interesting that Ken Davidson writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> specifically points to the Murphy model and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The model's architect, Dr Cris Murphy, describes it as short-run Keynesian and long run neo-classical. This means that in the short run, a lift in Government spending can lead to an overall rise in employment and output. But, because in the long run, output is determined by the productivity of the `supply side' of the economy and because general Government spending, even on capital goods, has no impact on productivity,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and note that point&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it can have no net positive impact on output and employment because it `crowds out' an equivalent level of productive private spending.</PARA>
<PARA>So when we turn to the Murphy model&mdash;and I have a copy of a  print out of its results here in front of me&mdash;we find just that: a basic assumption in this model that government spending, irrespective of how it is spent, will make no long run difference to the overall economic productivity of the country.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, that is manifestly stupid and we can go through table after table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will list a few of the items: general consumption, general government consumption, private dwelling investment, private non-dwelling construction investment, private equipment investment, real estate transfer expenses, public enterprise fixed investment, general government fixed investment, private non-farm inventory investment, farm and public authority inventory investment, statistical discrepancy, gross national expenditure, exports of goods and services, imports of goods and services, gross domestic product, public final demand, domestic final demand, private business fixed investment, nominal gross domestic product, gross domestic product deflator and so it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is page after page of indicators all set at zero because the assumption is that, however government spends its money, it will make no difference whatsoever in the long run to any of those indicators. In other words, if the Government&mdash;which it evidently is minded to do&mdash;takes all its money and throws it into the swamp at Gillman, the MFP site, and wastes it totally; or, alternatively, if it spends that money on a better rail system for Australia to improve the efficiency of our rail transport; or if, for instance, it spends that money on a better educational system; the model on which most of the debate is based makes the assumption that there would be no difference whatsoever to any of the economic indicators no matter which of those choices was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, when I asked the question of Senator Button today, not only did he not know that that was an assumption which was built into the computer models and many of the other computer models but also from the loud guffaws that I heard on both sides of this chamber I could only presume that most people in this chamber did not know that that assumption is built into the computer models. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not surprisingly, if one built into the model at the beginning that, irrespective of how government spends its money, it can make no difference to the economic productivity of a country, one will conclude that it is a good idea to cut down on government expenditure. In other words, one will draw the conclusion that there is a direct relationship with the assumption made on the input. As I said at the beginning: garbage in, garbage out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exactly the same sorts of things apply to the extended model which was used by the Government in its econometric analysis. Indeed, Peter Hartcher in his article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> a few days ago made a very telling comment when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If economics is the dismal science, then econometrics is the faintly absurd science. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is the exceedingly absurd science. Anything that claims to be science that makes those sorts of assumptions clearly is not science at all. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . where the unknowable course of our economic future is purportedly rendered knowable in fine and precise detail&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>making the sorts of assumptions to which I have just alluded. He also&mdash;and this is very relevant to the Fightback package&mdash;made a very telling point against the Fightback package and against the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, because he said;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And yet Fightback and its promotional literature offers it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as a promise. If there was a moment, a threshold in Dr Hewson's progress in Parliament, when he ceased being a professor and became a politician, it was this promise. It took him out of the realm of the man who was rigorously, sometimes painfully, honest, into the realm of the professional, full-blooded politician.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paul Keating made that transition long ago.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a great pity that there is not a little more rigour in this place when it comes to debate. If there were, that rigour would indicate that we should shift the argument entirely away from these econometric models which are so deeply flawed. </PARA>

When I was preparing some other work tonight in my office I heard Senator Coulter say that both the Government and the Opposition believe that greed is good.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask Senator Coulter and the Democrats: what is wrong with either the Opposition or the Government trying to put a proposal before the Australian public that endeavours to make Australia more competitive, to give people incentives to try to do something about the problems with our current account, our structural problems with unemployment and a range of other things that need addressing in Australia right now, including the level to which our foreign debt has blown out and its servicing costs?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go over the ground that my colleagues went over other than to say a couple of things about the Treasury analysis that we have had put before us. That analysis is flawed in a number of areas, especially in two of its assumptions: firstly, inflation; and, secondly, transport costs. This will come out clearly in the debate over the next week or so and will demonstrate how clearly the analysis is flawed. There is also a flaw in the One Nation statement on industrial relations. It was remarkable to note the shift in position from the statement that was brought down by the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, in October compared with what we now see in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> document. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak for a few minutes on this report of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Higher Education Funding for the 1992-94 Triennium</EMPHASIS>. In it there is a great deal of extremely valuable information for anyone who is interested in knowing the direction of Australian higher education. However, as I looked through it I did notice something missing from its statement about consultation and its indication of the community activities that have occurred as far as the Department is concerned. The one thing that is missing is the Department's reaction to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, which I chair, and to which a number of members in this chamber belong. I just want to put on record tonight that that omission&mdash;and I am sure that it is not deliberate; it is probably just an oversight&mdash;of the important work that has been done by the Committee is something that ought to be set to rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing that did come out of our report, and that was taken up by the main players in the game, especially the universities, was a symposium which was organised in conjunction with our Committee, and which was held here in Parliament House in the last few weeks of December last year. That symposium was an extremely valuable event to the extent that the criticisms we made in our report about the quality of teaching in higher education institutions had obviously been taken to heart by the academic community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite our criticisms, representatives from, I think, every higher education institution in the country were prepared to join us to discuss where they were going and the problems that they were facing in terms of improving the quality of teaching.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, for one&mdash;and I am sure all members of the Committee felt the same way&mdash;was very impressed with the way these representatives approached this whole issue. They were honest and frank about the weaknesses of teaching in the higher education system. I believe that most of them went away from that symposium with a better sense of where they were going and a better sense of the problems that currently beset them. In a sense they also overcame a certain degree of `whinginess', which occasionally creeps into education and substitutes for action and deep thought in terms of setting directions for the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity of speaking to this report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Higher Education Funding for the 1992-94 Triennium</EMPHASIS>. In doing so, I point out that in Australia's current economic climate, pressures on higher education are likely to increase. Indeed, on page 13 of this report, it is noted that demand from school leavers will increase next year and there will be reduced intakes in higher education due to institutions adjusting for over-enrolment in 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report goes on to note that the 1991 cohort of year 12 students&mdash;which is significantly larger than the previous year's&mdash;will be particularly affected by the cut-back in intakes. State governments have also expressed their concern about the lack of opportunity for this year's cohort of school-leavers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lack of opportunity in education is something that I and a number of my colleagues are constantly hearing about from our constituents but, sadly, it is not the lack of opportunity for higher education. It is far more serious. It is the lack of opportunity to even finish school. We talk a lot about being the clever country. I guess it is a noble objective and one we would all like to see achieved, but it seems to me that there is clearly an inequity in the availability of education. If one lives in Sydney or any of the towns scattered around the eastern seaboard of Australia, one can be the richest person in the world and one's child can walk down the street to high school, for no real charge. It is virtually free education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one happens to live in remote Australia&mdash;in western Queensland, parts of New South Wales or Western Australia&mdash;one cannot do that. In many cases a very high cost is involved in sending children to school. In the name of equity it does not matter how rich we are, we should have that ability to send our children to school at a reasonable, comparative cost and that ability is just not there. Australia's farming community has the lowest level of formal educational achievement among Western industrialised countries. Obviously this is a cause for great concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Statistics compiled by the Victorian College of Agriculture and Horticulture show that less than 25 per cent of the Australian farm work force has secondary education above grade 10. This contrasts with more than 50 per cent in New Zealand, North America and Western Europe, and upwards of 90 per cent in Scandinavian countries. This worries me enormously. Australian rural communities, and farmers in particular, have had an excellent record for productivity improvement in Australia in the past. They have far outstripped all other sectors of the economy. But one of the things that will increasingly hold them back in the future is a lack of preparation at an education level to enable them to meet the challenges and grasp the opportunities of the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Studies in Australia and the United States have shown that higher levels of education and training significantly improve farm productivity. That is important not only for the farmers involved in these tight times, but also for Australia, which is desperately in need of export improvement and enhancement. I think, too, there is a problem with our need to keep young people on the land. That problem is directly related to being able to better equip them to cope with the challenges that confront them. It also arises from having few education opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With economic conditions such as we are now facing, in many cases it is the education of rural children that is suffering. Many on the Government side are ideologically opposed to private boarding schools, but for students in isolated areas of Australia it is their only access to high school education. This fact is recognised by the Government through the payment of an isolated children's allowance. As of January this year, each child who is forced to leave home and study because of isolation and living in remote Australia receives a non-means tested portion of $2,500 to board at a hostel or school. Yet the average cost Australia-wide is estimated at $4,900. So one does not have to be a mathematical genius to calculate that there is a shortfall that parents have to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These costs are horrendous, especially when parents have two, three or four children away at school. I have had a lot of contact with the Isolated Children's and Parents Association about the crisis being faced by farming families in trying to educate their children. I would like to congratulate the ICPA on the work it is doing to improve access to education for students in the isolated areas of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few remarks on the DEET report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Higher Education Funding for the 1992-94 Triennium</EMPHASIS>. The report outlines funding decisions for this period and supposedly builds on the policies and achievements of the Dawkins 1988 White Paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Higher Education: A Policy Discussion</EMPHASIS> and follows on from the policies outlined in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Higher Education: Quality and Diversity in the 1990s</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report labels the 1990s `a period of consolidation' during which we have seen significant changes to the higher education system, the effects of which we are now experiencing. The destruction of the binary divide and the creation of the unified national system have reduced the number of institutions from 76 to 40. The report cites this as a positive step, despite emerging criticisms from academics and students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The year 1992 will provide us with the opportunity to investigate the academic and economic impact of the merger process and to assess the future viability of the unified national system while turning our attention to those campuses that have resisted efforts to merge. The report outlines the impact of over-enrolments on 1992 intakes, believing that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pressures on higher education are likely to increase.</PARA>
<PARA>Where institutions exceeded commencing load targets in 1991, they are now reducing the number of offers for 1992. This has resulted in extraordinary levels of unmet demand, with over 50,000 students nationally missing out on university places this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over-enrolments averaging 7 per cent&mdash;or 23,000 students&mdash;and massive levels of overcrowding have had detrimental effects on the standard of our education system, as admitted in the National Board of Employment Education and Training's advice on planning for the 1992-94 triennium. The Board states that reports from institutions indicated that overcrowding was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . .sufficiently severe as to be seen as detrimental to a proper learning environment.</PARA>
<PARA>These effects include greatly increased lecture, tutorial and laboratory sizes, declining teaching standards and adverse effects on staff-student contact and research. The injection of nearly $300m in capital funding is a welcome measure, but will occur too late to alleviate many of the overcrowding problems of 1991-92 and is of little consolation to students in the system coping with crowded tutorials and decaying buildings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision by the Government to incorporate capital funding into operating grants from 1994 has disadvantages for specific institutions. Therefore, it is important that consultation takes place with these institutions. We look forward to the outcome of this process in a supplementary funding report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report notes that by 1994 the Government will have provided 85,000 new places in higher education over the decade. Increasing access to the higher education system is a commendable objective. However, these extra places have not been matched with additional funding for staffing, infrastructure and capital works. As a percentage of GDP, government spending on higher education has decreased from 1.03 per cent in 1983 to 0.92 per cent in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report points out that students will be paying $2,250 per year in the higher education contribution scheme in 1992.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's purported commitment to access and equity measures is duplicitous when students are forced to pay a rising HECS charge. The $3.9m allocation for equity programs in 1992 and the increase in Aboriginal support funds by 1993 are progressive steps towards encouraging participation by traditionally disadvantaged groups. The Government's recognition that HECS exemption scholarships are an important means of promoting Australia's research effort is a concession that HECS is a financial barrier to higher education for many students, especially post-graduate students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report looks into the 1990s and the outcomes of the Dawkins-led reforms. The legacy is one of declining funding for infrastructure, staffing and capital. It has bequeathed to us forcibly amalgamated institutions which have been pressured to over-enrol as many students as possible in order to get the funding on which they depend. The report acknowledges the importance of a balance between post-school education and training, especially if we are to meet the goals outlined in the Finn review. However, pressing concerns such as overcrowding, the effects of amalgamations, unmet demand and financial barriers to participation still remain and must be resolved if we are to become the clever and capable country. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australia National Audit Office's report No. 19 relates to the Department of Social Security, operational performance security and sickness benefit. This is yet another indictment of the running of the Department of Social Security. It also counteracts the claim that Senator Richardson made when he was Minister for Social Security&mdash;before he did the deal with Mr Keating for his job in communications&mdash;that Social Security had no fat left on it for trimming. He was definitely wrong. Auditor-General's report after Auditor-General's report has shown that&mdash;and Auditor-General's report No. 19 is no exception. Under the heading `Key Findings', the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both departmental studies and previous ANAO audits have indicated that improvements are needed. For example, only some 40% of regional offices were complying with the Department's quality assurance procedures; and when a performance accountability improvement reporting system was introduced, two area offices decided not to follow through with its implementation.</PARA>
<PARA>In speaking to this part of the Auditor-General's report, I wish to refer to the breakdown in operational performance monitoring that occurred last month. To talk about the breakdown of operational performance monitoring may seem irrelevant but was actually very relevant to the 6,000 people whose names, addresses and other details appeared on the backs of letters that were sent to 6,000 other people. Performance monitoring is very important when it comes to issues such as the sending out of letters and other very delicate details and issues that Social Security handles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Six thousand letters were sent to beneficiaries containing the financial details of other people. The error occurred in Sydney during a mail out of those 6,000 letters advising changes in pensions and family allowance entitlements throughout New South Wales. In a letter sent to backbenchers late last month, the Minister for Social Security, Dr Blewett, admitted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, the personal information included on the back of this advice was not that of the person to whom the advice was sent. This information included details of the financial institution account to which the pension or family allowance is paid, together with, in some instances, figures on the personal income and assets against which the person's entitlement should be assessed.</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose it does not matter all that much to Dr Blewett. As far as he is concerned, as a socialist, the interests of the community should come before individual rights. He is on the record as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We shouldn't get too hung up as socialists on privacy, because privacy in many ways is a bourgeois right that is very much associated with the right to private property.</PARA>
<PARA>It fills me with cheer to know that the current Minister for Social Security has that attitude about privacy. I suppose it would not worry him too much, but he had to put out a letter to make it look as though he really cared about the issue of privacy. A departmental spokesman pointed out to the media:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bungle occurred after a laser printer malfunctioned.</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot believe how often we are told in Estimates `Oh, Senator, it was a computer error' as if that is an excuse. I have said time and again in this chamber that a computer error is not an excuse. We find out in Estimates that letters are mailed out to pensioners telling them that they have not answered correspondence which they have never had. They are scared by the fact that they have received a second letter telling them that they have not complied with some instruction from the Department when in fact they never received the first letter. What do the bureaucrats from the Department say to me in Estimates? They say, `Oh, Senator, it was a computer error'. That is no excuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must have checks in place; there must be performance monitoring which ensures that that error does not occur. The Department can stand here and tell me that it sends out so many millions of letters a year. We cannot let computers dominate us. I have said a number of times in this chamber that one of the major issues in the next decade will be that of information storage and retrieval. It is an issue that all of us ought to address. I do not want the next generation to turn around and say, `Why didn't you do something about it?'. Doing something about it is not accepting that computer error is an excuse. The departmental spokesman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bungle occurred after a laser printer malfunctioned. The print run was shifted to another printer&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I presume there was a human being there who shifted it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the new material was printed on the backs of the documents. The Department's system of sampling checks then broke down as well.</PARA>
<PARA>The performance monitoring should be such that that should not happen. The victims of this breakdown were rightly angry. One has already indicated that she will be taking legal action against the Department. Their anger is even more understandable when it is recognised that such errors are not new. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In April last year the same problem occurred in Perth with some 660 people affected. In April there was a similar error. Why was a better performance monitoring check not put in place then? The Department knew that this sort of thing could happen. After the latest blunder the Privacy Commissioner, Mr O'Connor, claimed that he had understood the error was rectified after the incident in Perth a year ago. A departmental officer stated last month:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When it happened in Perth we couldn't pin down what caused it, but we put in a lot of new procedures to stop it happening again.</PARA>
<PARA>But it did happen again. In July last year the then Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson&mdash;before he did his deal and got his job in communications, the little job he wanted before he leaves&mdash;wrote to one of the Perth victims stating that the Department had introduced tighter controls to guard against the problem happening again. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am most concerned about errors of this nature and am satisfied that the Department acted quickly to rectify the problem.</PARA>
<PARA>We now find that the very same problem also occurred in Melbourne only a week before the revelation that it had occurred in Sydney. The bungle had occurred in Melbourne and Perth and nothing had been done apparently to rectify the problem. It is pertinent that in the key findings of the audit report the Audit Office has recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. staff at all levels need to understand clearly the objectives of operational performance monitoring, and have a greater commitment to undertaking it.</PARA>
<PARA>The staff need to be aware that the information they are dealing with is very personal. They cannot afford to make an error; they cannot afford to accept that the computer broke down. They must apply all the principles of monitoring that are in place and maybe even be encouraged to make suggestions about what else could happen to ensure that this does not happen. They should have a sense of corporate responsibility for maintaining that data so that it does not escape in the way it has and so that people's personal information does not appear on the back of letters going to other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department and the Privacy Commissioner have initiated inquiries into this blunder and I eagerly await the expeditious conclusion of these inquiries and the public airing of their findings. This bungle could have been avoided. As I said, it resulted from operational staff not checking computer printed mail closely enough following a computer breakdown. It is a simple enough task to install an automatic checking mechanism after such a breakdown or to direct computer operating staff to undertake a manual check. Minister Neil Blewett stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such a disclosure is a serious breach of privacy, and I have instructed the Department to cooperate fully with the Privacy Commissioner with any inquiries he may initiate.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that this bungle is more than a serious breach of privacy; it is a serious breach of the Privacy Act. Information privacy principle four, relating to the storage and security of personal information, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A record keeper who has possession or control of a record that contains personal information shall ensure:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)That the record is protected, by such security safeguards as it is reasonable in these circumstances to take, against loss, against unauthorised access, use, modification or disclosure, and against other misuse, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)That if it is necessary for the record to be given to a person in connection with the provision of a service to the record-keeper, everything reasonably within the power of the record-keeper is done to prevent unauthorised use or disclosure of information contained in the record.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that in this case it is very doubtful whether the Department of Social Security has ensured that there are reasonable security safeguards in the circumstances to protect these records against unauthorised disclosure. As such, it is quite possible that the victims of this bungle may be able to claim compensation under the Privacy Act. As the shadow Minister, Senator Alston, pointed out in his news release of 7 February:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After investigating a complaint, Section 52(1)(iii) of the Privacy Act 1988 empowers the Privacy Commissioner to `find the complaint substantiated and to make a determination that includes. . . a declaration that the complainant is entitled to a specified amount by way of compensation to individuals for any loss or damage suffered. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Minister Blewett claimed on television:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is most inappropriate that we should provide taxpayers' money as some kind of compensation in this situation.</PARA>
<PARA>That not only shows Minister Blewett's ignorance of the Privacy Act; it also demonstrates his attitude towards privacy&mdash;a bourgeois concept, as he called it. In his letter to backbenchers, Minister Blewett stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department is writing to all the people affected by this incident, firstly to apologise for their error and secondly to seek urgent return of the incorrect advices.</PARA>
<PARA>I have not seen a copy of this letter being sent to these people. However, I have tonight asked for a copy of the text of the letter by way of a question upon notice. I would almost lay odds on that the Department of Social Security has seen fit to inform the victims of this bungle about information privacy principle four and section 52(1)(iii) of the Privacy Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next revelation in this Auditor-General's report relates to the administration of sickness benefits. It is enlightening to read. The Audit Office's findings in relation to the administration of sickness benefits amount to an overwhelming endorsement of the decision in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> to tighten the administration of this benefit. As well, it is a major rebuff for the Department of Finance, which underestimated the savings to be derived from such a measure. In light of the audit report, it is likely that the savings the coalition estimates will be derived from tightening the administration of sickness allowance may be very conservative indeed. In the key findings of the audit report it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An audit of sickness benefit indicated that legislative and procedural requirements had not been followed adequately in that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. a significant proportion of clients in receipt of sickness benefit did not satisfy the legislative requirements of the Social Security Act&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is astounding&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and/or were not processed in accordance with departmental instructions and procedures&mdash;for example, DSS files indicated that medical eligibility was in doubt in 22 per cent of new claim cases and 32 per cent&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>nearly a third&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of continuation cases&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is another interesting fact&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and an Audit Office sample showed that up to 40 per cent of clients had been declared medically fit for light or other work but were still on benefit contrary to departmental instructions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No more fat left in the system! Branded, we were, by Senator Richardson as the people who were going to take money from the lame, the sick and the poor. That is what he said. He cast Senator Alston as the wicked person who was going to come and take all these benefits away. Yet here is the Auditor-General telling us that a large number, a significant proportion, of clients did not satisfy the legislative requirements of the Social Security Act, and that 40 per cent of them had been declared medically fit for light or other work but were still on benefit contrary to departmental instructions. The Auditor-General's report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. reviews conducted by the Department to reassess continuing entitlement were not being processed adequately, and many were ineffectual in result through failure to act on treating doctors' reports, delays in processing review forms, and overlooking cases of possible overpayment.</PARA>
<PARA>No more fat in the system! So lean we could not extract anything more out of it, yet the report talks of `overlooking cases of possible overpayment'. It was also found that, of an audit sample of sickness benefit recipients who had been on benefit for 24 months, none had been selected for review despite the fact that review initiatives introduced by the Department in December 1989 called for such reviews. It makes interesting reading. In our <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document the coalition states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . will ensure that only those genuinely sick and unable to work will receive this benefit. We will introduce more stringent and frequent medical examinations. The Coalition will require certificates from two independent medical practitioners to be provided whereas in the present just one medical certificate is required to receive sickness allowance.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not to try to take away sickness benefits from those who really need them. The more that this is targeted to those in genuine need, the more money, the more cake there will be to give to those people who genuinely need it. This report shows very clearly that there is still a huge amount of slop in the system. In addition, a coalition government will make the three-monthly medical review mandatory, while at six months DSS will have the discretion to direct recipients to be reviewed by a Commonwealth medical officer. The estimated net savings from this tightened administration, as well as extending the waiting period for sickness allowance to three weeks, will be $52.7m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Backing up the coalition's call for tighter administration of medical evidence provided in relation to claims for sickness allowance, the Audit Office recommends:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . medical practitioners and hospitals be encouraged more firmly to adopt the standard medical certificate and to ensure that the required information be provided in all cases.</PARA>
<PARA>In accordance with the coalition's call for improved medical review procedures, the Audit Office recommends:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">steps be taken to ensure the returned review forms be actioned promptly; that continuing entitlement be confirmed; and that all factors affecting the amount paid be considered more closely</PARA>
<PARA>In its assessment of the Fightback document, the Department of Finance claimed that, while it accepted that $14m would be saved from tightened administration of sickness allowance, there would be additional administrative costs of about $7.5m entailed in these initiatives. The coalition does not agree that such large administration costs will be entailed in these initiatives, as the benefit recipient will be required to provide the second medical certificate. The coalition has not provided details in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> as to the percentage of the total net savings of $52.7m which will be derived from tightening administration rather than increasing the waiting period. However, given the Auditor-General's findings, it is reasonable to believe that the net savings which are contained in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> may be very conservative figures indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Auditor-General's report&mdash;thank heavens there is still somebody in this place who can be independent, not sullied by party politics&mdash;has shown that there are still some savings to be made and targeted to the population to which the benefits are directed and that the furphies and the claims made by the former Minister for Social Security that we are out to rip money from the poor and sick are nonsense. He and his Party do not have the monopoly on compassion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we had a system in place where people did not think that computers were gods, where they actually attended to the detail and where they did not use computer errors as excuses, we might find that people's privacy was protected. If the Department took more care to implement the legislation and to ensure that the benefits were targeted to those who were entitled to them, then, as I said, there would be more for those who genuinely needed it and maybe less of a burden for the taxpayer to have to bear, given the current economic climate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's report is very worthwhile reading. I commend the office for the work it has done. I ask the Department to address the issues and not just to say that the changes that were brought in in November 1991, with the sickness benefit being replaced by sickness allowance, deal with some of these issues. I do not think that is the case. The Department should pay very close attention to the report and look to the savings that can be made. </PARA>

<PARA>This report is the third by the Auditor-General on Defence Department activities for the current financial year. It examines eight areas, including personnel and pay systems, an armament stores supply system, Navy victualling, trade repairs by civilian contractors and protective security. Before dealing with this report, I want to register my support for the continuing scrutiny of Defence expenditure by the Australian National Audit Office. There is far too little independent scrutiny of Defence expenditure for the simple reason that it is the one area of public spending which has been regarded as sacrosanct and exempt from the usual questioning to which government programs are normally subjected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the eight areas examined in this report, only two were found to be satisfactory. Significant problems were identified in the remaining six. I shall refer to only four of them by way of example. In examining the Army personnel and pay system, the Auditor found a general lack of satisfactory independent checks of input data relating to pay variations of military personnel. In examining the civilian pay system, the Auditor-General suggested that improvements were necessary to internal controls, including more effective division of duties and control over password security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the armament stores and the computerised supply system for these stores the Auditor-General identified a general need for operational instructions and guidelines and an improvement in system management. In dealing with protective security, the Auditor-General recommended that a number of weaknesses should be referred to the Department for attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that the Defence Department has given commitments to address and correct these problems. However, it gives little cause for comfort that a lack of adequate financial control has been identified in so many areas by the Audit Office.

I am convinced that the Defence Department has been shielded from adequate scrutiny for so long that many more such problems have yet to be brought to light. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments are mainly to make the administration of various Government programs more efficient and cost effective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The addition of new section 20A to the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 will introduce a Ministerial power of direction in relation to the draft Territory Plan where the Territory planning authority continues to object to any aspect of the draft Plan prepared by the National Capital Planning Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other amendments will allow regulations to be made enabling the NCPA to charge fees for applications for planning and related approvals. This power will be limited to the recovery of costs reasonably associated with the application and they must not be set at such levels that they would amount to taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following amendments are made to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">international anti-doping agreements will be recognised    in the Act, allowing greater cooperation between the Commonwealth and other countries regarding the listing  of defaulting competitors;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the reporting requirements as regards negative test     results are widened so as to accommodate sports organisations that have contracted with the Agency that require confirmation of a negative test result prior to recognising records and awarding medals. Competitors will also be advised of who will be notified if they return a negative test result or if they refuse to provide a sample;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Agency will be provided with the standard tax     exemptions granted to Commonwealth statutory authorities;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Agency will be given the power to delegate a number    of its powers under the Act to any of its employees. The Agency comprises a relatively small number of specialist staff, and such a power of delegation is considered appropriate to ensure the efficiency of the Agency's functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981 and the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 will facilitate the giving of evidence by expert analysts and overcome any gaps in evidence in judicial proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Addition of botanic gardens under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 will enable the Norfolk Island Botanical Garden and the Australian National Botanical Garden, as well as any other park or reserve created in the future, to be managed as a botanic garden through a plan of management under the Act. Three international agreements are also added to the Schedule in respect of which the Governor-General will be empowered to make regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the Norfolk Island Act 1979 will permit the Acting Administrator and Deputy Administrator to exercise the powers of the Administrator when the Administrator is absent from duty, for example, on recreation leave, without actually being physically absent from the Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the amendment to the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986, the National Cultural Heritage Committee will be given the power to approve a recommendation or report under section 10 or 10A without the need to convene a meeting. This will enable those members of the Committee who are eligible to consider the issue to accept a recommendation or report by signing a document detailing the terms of their acceptance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will remove any question concerning the legality of a procedure that has already on several occasions been successfully adopted by the Committee, while at the same time ensuring that it can only be adopted if all members agree to the sign the relevant document.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FOREST CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation fulfils an undertaking made by the Prime Minister in the March statement to introduce Forest Conservation and Development Legislation to better protect Australia's native forests and concurrently facilitate much needed value adding investment and jobs in Australia's forest industries. The legislation will do so in a transparent and predictable way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short, this policy initiative is a major reform. This Government is deeply committed to reforms that will produce secure, long term jobs for the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is always possible for Governments to grasp short term expedients in the quest for creating jobs. But these almost always mean the jettisoning of longer term, and often critical objectives, such as protecting Australia's environmental and cultural heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not the way for this Government&mdash;it never has been and never will be.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation is the result of long, careful and hard analysis; of careful consideration of the views of the ACTU and timber unions, environmental and industry groups; and of much consultation with the States and Territories including at the Special Premiers' Conference in July 1991. It has been constructed with our sights firmly set on the imperative of ecologically sustainable development&mdash;the proposition that we can and must reconcile legitimate concerns to preserve the values of our forests for current and future generations of Australians, and the equally legitimate concerns to use those same resources to advance other community objectives, through the development of value adding forest industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry must have&mdash;and I believe to a large degree does have&mdash;the same objective of conserving the value of our forests for future uses&mdash;for without such an active commitment there can be no long term future for the industry itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This constructive balance of what are always competing, if not conflicting, resource usages, is embodied in the legislation being introduced into the Parliament today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now outline the features of the legislation for honourable senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Objectives of the Bill</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal concurrent objectives of this Bill are to provide security and certainty to both the forestry industry, and to the Australian community</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to provide security and certainty to industry so it can make significant long term investments with confidence that Governments of the future will not prevent or obstruct that investment's productive outcome</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to provide security and certainty to the Australian community that all of its interests, whether they be for values that are environmental, cultural, heritage, social or economic&mdash;both for the current and future generations&mdash;are adequately and comprehensively safeguarded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill does not attempt to confer any new powers on the Commonwealth or on any minister; rather it establishes a method of integrating a broad range of processes under existing Commonwealth laws and regulations. At the same time it also provides a mechanism to integrate similar State and Territory Government processes with the Commonwealth's, in a constructive, time-saving and co-operative manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now outline the conditions relating to the granting of resource security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Enterprise</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, the proponent must satisfy the Commonwealth that it has a legal standing as an enterprise in the meaning of the terms of this Bill. That is, the enterprise is a duly constituted company, partnership or a joint venture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have recognised in the legislation that, in particular with large scale investments of the kind envisaged here, it often may not be possible or practicable for a single company to undertake a project. But this should not be interpreted to mean a mere collection of sawmills could club together for the purposes of qualifying for resource security. Because the Government desires to promote value-adding industries, its approach to legislative resource security is based on a project rather than a region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dominant Purpose</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wood Processing Project's dominant purpose must be to make a new investment of at least $100 million to produce goods for export and/or for import replacement. This legislation is not designed to protect the industrial status quo by providing security to any use of wood for any purpose from any region. It is designed to shift the industry towards export oriented, value adding activities and to facilitate large projects of that kind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">World scale pulp mills are, of course, the paradigm case and we want to see such developments at the earliest opportunity. But, again the Government has recognised, and acknowledged in this legislation, the commercial reality that investments of this size may also be made up of a set of integrated activities. This does not mean we would countenance a mere collection of sawmills as being eligible for resource security; we will only consider a proposal if it emanates from a company or group of companies whose activities are genuinely integrated. For example, such a proposal might involve, but not be limited to, a large scale sawmill, a veneer plant, a flitch mill, a woodchip plant to process the residues, and the establishment of plantations as a further resource base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also recognised that significant large scale investments of the type we are endeavouring to encourage, can and do arise when companies expand or extend their existing facilities, perhaps through modernising or upgrading. The legislation enables this type of expansion to be eligible for resource security, provided it involves a substantial increase in the amount or the value of goods produced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$100 Million Threshold</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many detractors of the Bill criticise it for the requirement that a project must cross the $100 million threshold before we will consider its eligibility. Let me remind honourable senators that it was industry that initially sought resource security for major investments&mdash;and investments which at the time were referred to as being in the hundreds of millions, and even billions of dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are determined to focus on investments of this size in the context of this legislation, because what the Government is offering to industry is not being done lightly. We are saying to industry, we the Government of Australia, after conducting a comprehensive integrated assessment, and satisfying ourselves that certain obligations have been entered into by the enterprise and the State Government, that we tie ourselves by legislation  not to use our statutory powers, except in exceptional circumstances. This, for any government, is an enormously important decision. We are willing to take it to facilitate investments of high value in the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not, in producing this legislation, ignored the bulk of the forest products industry. I will return to this theme a little later, however, after I have completed the description of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commercial Plantations</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill gives force to the Government's clear and unambiguous policy of excluding from eligibility for resource security any project whose dominant purpose is the export of logs or woodchips from native forests. As a further concrete way of underpinning this objective, the Commonwealth considers it necessary for industry proponents seeking resource security, as well as the Governments involved, to give appropriate consideration to the establishment, maintenance and use of forestry plantations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a further boost to this policy, we have recognised the need to encourage investment in commercial plantations. Such investment&mdash;for export of woodchips, or to provide resource for downstream processing, or both&mdash;will be eligible for consideration for resource security under this legislation. Where the proposal is to export woodchips we would need to be satisfied they would be surplus to domestic requirements&mdash;that is, surplus to the needs of downstream processing operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consideration of resource security for this proposal would not include any woodchip from native hardwood forests. And, of course, the other criteria&mdash;including the $100 million threshold&mdash;must be met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is expected that together with the Government's other policy initiatives on plantations, this legislation will encourage a significant increase in the area of commercial plantations in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Up-Front Assessment</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real antecedents of this legislation can be found in industry's feelings of uncertainty, engendered by fear of the Commonwealth using its powers to remove significant tracts of forest from productive investments. We do not accept the validity of that perception, but we do accept that it exists and influences investment decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hugely important point for industry that the Government acknowledges in this legislation, is that once a company has taken a major investment decision, following government giving the green light, it should not be for the Government to intervene later to thwart the product of that investment in anything other than the most exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way any government can have the confidence to renounce using its undoubted and legitimate powers, is if it has first conducted a thorough and comprehensive integrated assessment of the project; and in conducting such an assessment, to have assured itself that all matters that fall within its responsibility have been addressed and, where appropriate and necessary, decisions considered and responsibly made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation carefully spells out the nature of that assessment. It after all is the basis on which the Government's guarantee not to use its powers, stands or falls. In this regard the Bill</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">says the assessment will cover all of the values likely to be affected: environmental, cultural, heritage, social and economic</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">says that the Australian Heritage Commission must have a reasonable opportunity to consider and comment on matters that are within its ambit</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">says that all the processes under the Commonwealth's Environment Protection (impact of proposals) Act have to be complied with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The integrated assessment process will also include the application of the World Heritage Convention and the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act, together with provisions under the Aboriginal heritage legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation does not water down the Government's environmental policies or its legislation. To the contrary; what it does do is ensure that environmental issues are taken into account when and as they should be: up-front, comprehensively, decisively, once and for all for the life of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is wrong to suggest as some critics have, that applying the assessment provisions of the resource security legislation up-front, is tantamount to the Government abrogating its responsibility to protect the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side, many industry and some State critics have suggested that such a thorough and comprehensive assessment will be too time consuming and will duplicate State activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make this very clear&mdash;we will conduct assessments as fast as possible consistent with the thoroughness needed to provide the very certainty industry and unions want. There will be no undue duplication either of efforts or assessments between the Commonwealth and the States. It is the Government's intention&mdash;indeed it will be the legal requirement under section 12(4) of the Bill&mdash;that the Commonwealth assessment process must as far as practicable be integrated and co-ordinated with that of the State.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an example of co-operative federalism I am sure this legislation will be outstanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth accepts that, provided all its assessment requirements are met before final approval is given and legislative resource security is provided, the assessment process can take place in two steps if a State wishes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A State may wish to propose that a quantity of resource is required from a particular area of forest for a particular purpose. In the first step the Commonwealth and the State would develop and apply an integrated process to ensure all their relevant respective requirements were met. If, as a result, such a use of the resource were judged by each to be acceptable the Commonwealth would indicate that this is its view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second step would then comprise Commonwealth and State assessment of a specific project proposal. Again in this second step the Commonwealth and the State would develop and apply an integrated process to ensure all their relevant respective requirements were met. Requirements would not be reapplied except to the extent that knowledge of the specific plant and resource proposal, including the linkage between plant and resource, raised issues not covered in the first step consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legislative resource security would follow the final approval of the project upon completion of the second step.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreements Between the Commonwealth, State and Enterprise</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Commonwealth issues a declaration that a project has resource security it will do so on the basis of formal written agreements between it and the State in which the project is to be conducted, and between the State and the enterprise. These agreements will be public and they will be legally binding&mdash;with the sanction against a serious breach being the potential withdrawal of resource security and a return to the existing situation of perceived comparative uncertainty. These agreements, together with the integrated up-front assessment, are the foundation of resource security. They will contain the undertakings of the three parties that will be essential to a successful and ongoing project. These are, in essence</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">an undertaking by a State to provide the necessary volume of resources for the project</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">an undertaking by the Commonwealth not to exercise its powers to prevent or obstruct the project</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">an undertaking by the enterprise in relation to its conduct of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as such undertakings, the agreements will be required to incorporate other provisions or procedures that are critical to all parties having confidence that resource security will work in practice. These include</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provisions requiring the State to monitor and enforce compliance with environmental management practices that the enterprise will be obliged to undertake;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a provision allowing the Commonwealth to monitor the State's compliance with its obligation to enforce any obligations imposed on the enterprise;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provisions requiring consultation on the agreement at any of the signatories' request;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provisions requiring specific cooperation and consultation when the Commonwealth may contemplate using the exceptions provisions; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provisions covering procedures for renegotiation and termination of the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How Secure is Resource Security?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project having been judged eligible, the up-front assessment having been done, and the agreements concluded; just how secure is a project's access to its necessary volume of resources?  Will the Commonwealth really stand back and let the enterprise get on with it?  Won't the Commonwealth dream up new (or revisit old) ways to negate an enterprise's investment decision?  Just how "secure" is resource security?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been repeatedly stated, this government is not in the business of abrogating its environmental (or any other) responsibilities. Of course we recognise&mdash;as do the States with whom we have discussed this issue at length, and as do industry and unions&mdash;that things can change, that events can occur that are totally unforeseen, that exceptional situations can arise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recognising these realities of life, we have stated unequivocally and clearly in the Bill what those circumstances have to be, before the Commonwealth will wish to take a second look at the way a project with legislated resource security is being conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators should be aware that this Bill does not make it easy either for the Commonwealth to remove resource security, or for a minister to exercise a power that has been made dormant by the granting of resource security. The circumstances involved are remote and they are unexpected. And there is nothing automatic about these processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the Government's intention that before any minister can consider whether or not to take any action, consultation will take place not only between government ministers, but also with the parties to the agreements in accordance with procedures laid down in those agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are five potential circumstances set out in the Bill under which ministers might need to reactivate their dormant powers. These are all exceptional circumstances and the Government would not contemplate invoking dormant powers other than for those exceptional circumstances. The five exceptions are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, in order</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to prevent a "major physical impact" on the natural environment or Australia's cultural heritage, or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to prevent a species of flora or fauna becoming threatened, or more threatened, or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to prevent a substantial adverse effect on a "physical feature or thing" that is part of the cultural or natural heritage or national estate, or on a significant Aboriginal area or object</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but only where these circumstances were not foreseen and had not been assessed up-front.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A species will be declared as threatened only after ministers are satisfied that an adequate scientific basis exists and only after there has been appropriate consultation with the States and their views taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second exception concerns the use of Commonwealth powers during the construction or commissioning stages, simply where it was not practicable to do so during the assessment stage (for example to test some part of the plant that by definition cannot be done earlier); this section only relates to powers relevant to the construction or operation of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third exception relates to matters quite extraneous to the up-front environmental, cultural, heritage, social and economic issues assessment, simply to cover such matters as acquiring land for defence purposes, or blocking exports under United Nations' sanctions.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth matter covers failure to comply with conditions or requirements imposed as a result of, during or after, the assessment process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government believes that it is better to spell out with precision what these highly restricted circumstances will be, rather than to leave industry in the dark by the use of a general statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two final matters to bring to honourable senators' attention are;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">this Bill will not affect taxation or foreign investment review powers, and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">this Bill will involve the exercise of responsibilities of several portfolios.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non-Legislated Resource Security</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned before that this Government did not intend to ignore the position of the bulk of the industry's hardwood sawmilling sector. Because of the enormous significance of the Government tying its hands in legislation not to use its powers, Government will only apply the Bill to very large investments of amounts exceeding $100m. Of course the bulk of forest industry cannot be comprehended by the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has approved a non-legislative form of resource security that will go a long way to providing the type of security this part of the industry is seeking&mdash;and at the same time encourage restructuring towards a more competitive industry for the future providing more and better jobs for Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arrangements to be offered by the Commonwealth&mdash;through formal Commonwealth-State agreements&mdash;are similar to the provisions in the Bill, in that they include a comprehensive up-front assessment covering all Commonwealth responsibilities for environmental, cultural, heritage, social and economic matters; intergovernmental agreements between the Commonwealth and State; State-enterprise contracts; as well as provisions to accommodate changing circumstances of an exceptional nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The type of project we envisage could well use these arrangements, is for example a sawmilling enterprise within a prescribed area, such as the New South Wales south east forests.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the enterprise must be willing to commit either to the value adding investment or to industry restructuring</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the relevant State Government must be prepared to offer a longer term, contractually based supply licence for sawlogs to enable the investment to proceed, such as has been the case in Victoria and Western Australia</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the woodchip export company must have invested, or be prepared to invest, in other value adding activities in Australia, either in sawmilling enterprises or commercial plantations and agree that domestic value adding of the woodchips has priority over their use for export.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that the Commonwealth is involved in export licensing in the region concerned, it will offer a longer term export licence up to the year 2000 and thereafter on a case by case basis, on the understanding that if the woodchips are required for domestic use then, subject to market consideration, they should be directed to that end. This should not detract from the Commonwealth's firm desire to achieve maximum domestic processing of woodchips by the year 2000 or soon thereafter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government intends to discuss this proposal now with both the States and industry. We are confident, as I said before, that it will meet many if not all of this sector of the industry's concerns.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Family Law Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1991 No. 447 and made under the Family Law Act 1975, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1991 No. 450 and made under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA>This disallowance motion of the Australian Democrats has been made necessary by the Government's extraordinary attempt to impose yet another cost on people involved in Family Court litigation. The crux of the new regulations is regulation 16A, which provides for the introduction of a $500 hearing fee. This hearing fee has been popularly termed a setting down fee, and I shall use that term. The fee is payable when a court, a judge or a registrar fixes a date for the hearing in the Family Court of an application or an issue or question in an application or an appeal to the Full Court, whether from a decision of the Family Court or from a decision in another court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People do not choose to go to the Family Court; they are compelled to seek a legal resolution of conflicts arising out of a marriage breakdown, which often involves access and custody of children. The Government proposes to burden these people at this most traumatic time of their lives with an extra $500 fee that they cannot avoid and, in most cases, simply cannot afford. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a typical Family Court case, there would be an application for dissolution of marriage which would necessitate at that point an initial $300 filing fee plus, of course, the parties' own legal costs. It has been estimated that the cost of a typical all-inclusive custody hearing comprising only one or two days in court with no complications ranges from $5,000 to $8,000. Hard fought custody cases, involving complicated issues such as allegations of child sexual abuse, might require 20 court days and hearing costs of $2,000 to $3,000 a day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to disputes over matrimonial property, it has been estimated that matters proceeding to trial would have costs ranging between $3,000 to $10,000. Here I am talking of the average, everyday cases handled by the Family Court. We know that of all the divorces in Australia, only about 5 per cent finish up in court. Some States are fortunate to have a much lower percentage. In Tasmania, the figure is only 1 1/2 per cent, due to intensive counselling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not talking here of those extreme cases which have been reported to a number of government and Senate inquiries currently in progress&mdash;the cost of justice inquiry and the Family Court inquiry. Cases have been noted which finish up costing $100,000 or $150,000 and, in one memorable instance, $250,000. I am referring to those cases which involve ordinary people who are forced to litigate their differences because they are not part of that fortunate 95 per cent. They are forced to go to a court to resolve their differences. We find that, in addition to those average costs, which are already an extremely difficult load for them, they are now going to be faced with an extra $500 imposed by the Australian Government. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should note that the Government is surely aware that the legal system in Australia is, at present, undergoing some very detailed scrutiny by those inquiries that I have mentioned. Knowing that, one can only conclude that the introduction of a $500 setting down fee is clearly an intentional abdication by the Federal Government of its responsibility to improve access to justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will, no doubt, say that the exemptions contained in regulation 16(2) adequately cover people who cannot afford the $500 fee. The exemptions do include people receiving legal aid and others at the lower end of the income scale. However, it is important to note that there is a large number of Australians who are unable to meet the stringent legal aid criteria but who still cannot afford the steeply rising costs of our legal system. For example, in the ACT a person with two dependants will no longer be entitled to legal aid if he or she has a gross income of over $283 per week. How can someone on that low income afford an extra $500?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, figures indicate that not only in the ACT, but all over Australia, the number of rejected legal aid applicants has sharply increased. Victoria is one of the hardest hit States, with a rejection rate of over 40 per cent of legal aid applicants. Clearly, this squeeze, due to the rising demand for legal aid services and a reduction in funds available, is reducing the number of people who are able to avail themselves of legal aid and who therefore would fall under this exemption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another provision which the Government will point to. The proposed regulations do permit the courts' registrar to waive the $500 fee `on the ground that payment of the fee would impose financial hardship on the person'. But why should people be subjected to the additional process by having to apply for an exemption to that fee? The individual concerned would face the stigma of pleading financial hardship to obtain what is every citizen's right&mdash;access to the legal system. The registrar is to have regard to the `income, assets and liabilities of the person liable to pay the fee', but there are no other criteria and the discretion is therefore entirely in the registrar's hands, making the litigant very much a supplicant. This is clearly an untenable situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government wants to recover a proportion of court costs I would suggest that it should instead establish a user-pays court for corporations and tax disputes above $5m. This method would be seen as a much more efficient way of recouping some of the expenditure that the Government now has in the court system. I welcome the support of the coalition parties for my disallowance motion, no doubt influenced by the evidence some of its members have received, as I have, in the Family Court inquiry and the cost of justice inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also welcome the coalition parties' support for my motion of disallowance No.4 of the $200 setting down fee in the AAT. Clearly this setting down fee should not apply to a tribunal where approximately 70 per cent of the applications lodged in the 1989-90 were concerned with workers' compensation, social security and veterans' entitlements legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government, of course, wishes to resist the motion from Senator Spindler to disallow regulations which impose certain fees in the family law jurisdiction and in the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. We do so because we believe it is proper that those who approach those jurisdictions make some contribution to the cost of the provision of a way of resolving a matter which has all the sanction, authority and status of a court or a tribunal of such significance as the AAT.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fee is not designed to reduce access to the courts or to tribunals for the resolution of disputes in our society to the status of just another commodity or asset to be bought in</PARA>
<PARA>the marketplace. It does not mean that only those who are wealthy enough can utilise this very important function or power in our society which is exercised by judges or those who sit on various benches and tribunals. That would be totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the motivation for Senator Spindler moving this motion and the Opposition supporting it is that they are of a view that access to justice is too important a matter in our society&mdash;which is governed by the rule of law&mdash;to be left simply to the marketplace to determine who can afford it, I would be in agreement with them. But when we look at the way in which the regulations are structured, one finds that there is indeed no intention on the part of the Federal Government to deny to those who cannot afford to pay the fees which are set down in these regulations access to the Family Court or to the AAT. For example, a person liable, or who might otherwise be liable, to pay the fee but who is a recipient of legal aid is not required to pay the fee. Of course, that is only sensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nor should a person pay the fee who is the holder of a pensioner health benefit card, a health benefit card, a pharmaceutical benefits concession card, or a health care card; nor should an inmate of a prison, somebody lawfully detained in a public institution, a child under the age of 18 years, or a person in receipt of Austudy. Not only are those specific grounds set out, but also, if a registrar, having regard to the income, assets and liabilities of the person liable to pay the fee, is of the view that the payment of the fee would impose financial hardship on the person, once again the fee can be waived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I believe it is important just to point out that we are not trying to create a situation, which would be intolerable in our sort of society, whereby the imposition of a series of fees made it impossible for people to seek the assistance of the courts to resolve a dispute, in the case of the two matters we are concerned with, before the Family Court or the AAT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, without bending the knee or bowing the head to the ideology of user pays unnecessarily, I believe that there is also an argument that it is not unreasonable for those who use these very expensive services provided by society to resolve a dispute by invoking the assistance of this particular part of our social structure&mdash;certainly in the case of the Family Court which has proved perhaps not amenable to counselling, mediation or any of the other means which would allow settlement to be reached before one needs to approach a judge to determine and rule on the disputed matter, whether it be custody, property or whatever&mdash;for the sake of the great majority of other persons in our society who have to pay taxes to uphold these institutions to ask the person approaching the court to make not full payment but a contribution. That is what we have in mind in setting down the list of fees for the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, although this is not the primary motive, if the imposition of these fees leads to some incentive for parties to perhaps think twice about whether they might not be able to resolve the matter before requiring the judgment of the court, that would be a good side effect. But, basically, the fees are being levied in order to assist the Federal Government to discharge its obligation to fund the system of justice, which we are obliged to do if our society is to remain one governed by the rule of law, and the contribution, running into some millions of dollars, certainly would be very helpful in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the question of the amount that people might be required to pay, I think it is worth dispelling some of the more outrageous estimates that have been bandied around in certain letters that have been received by honourable senators. There is no doubt, of course, that the fees will add at least $100 to all applications made to the Family Court, unless of course the parties seek consent orders, in which case no fee is payable. In most cases, it is estimated that the additional cost will be about $200, that being an application fee plus one or two interim or interlocutory applications. In that situation, when one looks at the fees that are paid to the lawyers&mdash;without taking into account GST on the legal fees of course; I am speaking about the present, not some perilous future in regard to the question of lawyers' fees&mdash;the $200 or so is not an extravagant amount to ask people to pay. It is not extravagant when one looks at the total cost that they will be asked to bear in relation to the legal advice and representation they receive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the AAT&mdash;and I think Senator Spindler spoke to this in the course of his remarks&mdash;a hearing fee of $200 is to be payable on the setting down for hearing of an application for a review of an administrative decision. I think it is very important to note&mdash;and I know that Senator Macdonald will have noted this, but I do not know how much weight he has given to it&mdash;that the $200 hearing fee is not payable in those income maintenance matters such as social security matters and veterans' affairs matters. That is a very important and very proper concession. Of course, in such cases we are not talking about two persons in society who are in dispute and seeking the court's resolution of the matter, as is the case in the Family Court; we are talking about a person in society who believes he or she has an entitlement under the laws passed by this Parliament which has been denied by some bureaucratic decision and the person seeks to advance reasons why that denial should be reversed and the entitlement given. In that situation I think it is quite right and proper that the hearing fee of $200 should not be applied, and that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so far as I have been able to discern any pattern in the correspondence which I have received, it is about the impact of the fees in the tax jurisdiction. It is the case that since 1987 when the AAT acquired its tax jurisdiction from the taxation boards of review the number of applications for review has dropped substantially. This may in part be attributed to the cost of making an application, which has increased&mdash;I think it was about $2 back in 1987&mdash;but I do not believe that that is by any means the total story. Self-assessment has also led to a reduction in the number of applications for review of assessments so that now the typical taxation matter involves substantial amounts of money. In that situation we also ought to note that the taxation system is currently being altered to provide for objections to be lodged directly with the AAT rather than by the Commissioner of Taxation. Taxpayers who object to a decision are given a free internal review of the assessment and should proceed to the AAT or the Federal Court only after having had the opportunity to properly assess the merits of their application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I believe that when one puts aside the income maintenance matter&mdash;social security and veterans' affairs&mdash;and simply looks, say, at the taxation matters the problem is not so large that it should lead the Senate to disallow these particular regulations. So the Government, of course, supports those regulations referred to in notices of motion Nos 1 and 4 dealing with the Family Court and the AAT fee structure which are before the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to speak on all four. They all relate to the same sort of matter and it may save some time later if I indicate on behalf of the Liberal and National parties the attitude that we intend to take. We intend to support the disallowance motions foreshadowed in notices of motion Nos 1 and 4, but we will not support any disallowance motions in relation to the other two.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has given very serious consideration to the proposals that the Government announced in the Budget last year to charge a setting-down fee for the Federal Court and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. When I took the opportunity during the Senate Estimates process of pursuing the matter with the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) and officials of the Attorney-General's Department, I was advised that the proposal to introduce setting-down fees arose from a review of fees in Commonwealth courts and tribunals which involved a number of Commonwealth departments and agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to gain some understanding of the reasons behind the decisions to implement these fees, the shadow Attorney-General, the Hon. Andrew Peacock, has asked the Department on a number of occasions since 13 February for a copy of this report, which apparently has the status of an intradepartmental working document. The copy, unfortunately, was eventually provided only late yesterday, and this was some hours after the shadow Ministry had completed its considerations on the matter, and the information contained in the report&mdash;some 38 pages plus lengthy schedules&mdash;was not able to be taken into consideration. Up until that time, the only documentation on the reasons for the decision to introduce setting-down fees has been a press release of the Attorney-General dated 18 December 1991 and the answers to some questions which were raised in the Estimates Committee on 5 September 1991 by me and, Madam Acting Deputy President, by you as well, and you will well recall that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the press release issued by the Attorney-General, the justification for the imposition of these fees is that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They will raise revenue which will return significant net benefit to the justice system.</PARA>
<PARA>In the Estimates Committee we asked the Minister whether these fees were simply a fundraising issue. I understood the Minister or his officials to agree that that was the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Duffy noted in his press release that the total fee revenue covered only a very small portion of the total costs of running the courts and tribunals system. It has not been an easy matter to determine the forums in which the new fees would apply or the amount of the fees. In the Budget Speech, it was simply announced that there was to be a setting down fee in the Federal courts and the AAT of $500. I quote from the Budget Papers, which say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will introduce a new fee structure in federal courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, from September 1991&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is pretty typical of government legislation; it proposes things for September and here we are some six months later still dealing with it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">with the aim of achieving a more equitable fee structure. The major change will be the introduction of a setting down fee of $500 in all jurisdictions&mdash;that is, a fee payable when a matter is ready to be listed for hearing.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, typical of this Government, it could not even get its Budget Papers right. It was telling us in these documents that it was $500 for all Federal courts plus the AAT. It only transpired from questioning in an Estimates committee some 10 days or so later, on 5 September, that the departmental officials then said for the first time that the AAT fee was to be only $200. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, that is typical of this Government. It really does not know what it is doing. It has little idea of how to manage things and how to administer its departments. As I mentioned, it now transpires that it is the Government's intention to have that setting down fee of $500 in the Federal, Family and High courts and a fee of $200 in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the Family Court&mdash;and this comes under notice of motion No. 1&mdash;a variety of fees covering other court services are also introduced in these regulations. The court will be required to impose fees of $100 covering originating applications; interlocutory applications of $50; a full court appeal in child support matters of $500; and appeals from magistrates, registrars and judicial registrars of $100. Similar charges are also made in relation to the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of policy, the Liberal and National parties are of the view that it is of paramount importance to the swift, cost effective administration of justice that the whole Federal system of justice, including the High Court, be managed on sound, cost-disciplined administrative principles. The recent proposed cutbacks outlined in the Fightback package emphasise a streamlining of the administrative and bureaucratic arms of the justice system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has been supportive of the current examination by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into the costs of justice, legal services and litigation. The Committee's terms of reference require it to examine, amongst other things, the management of the courts and the level of government charges which are imposed upon litigants within the court system. The Committee, as you would well know, Madam Acting Deputy President, is yet to report on these topics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it might be true to say that the coalition is not necessarily opposed to some measure of cost recovery where this will enhance sound management of the judicial system, we are concerned that the regulations currently on the table unnecessarily increase the cost of justice and cause significant hardship in some cases. The Law Council of Australia shares this concern and has indeed argued strongly that these regulations ought not be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Duffy, again in typical fashion of this Government, dismissed the Law Society's criticisms in his press release of 18 September. In so doing, he had what I consider to be a fairly cheap shot at the profession. Mr Duffy said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I find it particularly disappointing that a leader of the Australian legal profession consistently calls for more Government funding for the justice system, and yet complains when something constructive is done to providing additional money. The Australian public must be even more cynical about such criticisms when it is the restrictive trade practices and high fees of the legal profession which are the greatest single inhibitor to access to justice.</PARA>
<PARA>With respect, the coalition does not dismiss the Law Council's arguments so lightly. Again, the Minister takes the easy and popular way out by having a shot at the legal profession when he should be looking closer to home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Council's view is that it is the right of all citizens to have access on as equal a basis as possible to the court system provided by the Government. It is the responsibility of the Government to provide a justice system funded from the general revenue of all citizens who may need to use the system at some stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly the case that ordinary Australians may be inhibited by the introduction of the fees proposed in these regulations. For those who do not qualify for legal aid or fall within the list of exempted persons, access to the legal system would be more expensive. It is again the middle Australians who are being squeezed out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Senator Tate does not care too much about the people on lower incomes within Australia. Those receiving under $21,000 did not even feature in the `Dumb Nation' statement that was issued the other day by Mr Keating. The Government has no interest in those sort of people. That is also borne out in its attitude to these fees. It is more related in that instance to the middle income Australians&mdash;those who do not qualify for legal aid and yet are not in the wealthy bracket of the members of huge corporations and the big business people, the super rich people, who were so prominent in the Labor Party in the 1980s. It is that middle income group that miss out in this justice system. It is those sort of people who are hurt most by these fees being imposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tate mentioned in his speech that section 16 provided that certain people were excluded from the fees. I acknowledge that that is correct. But, again, those people on welfare benefits and in receipt of pensions and legal aid are affected. As Senator Spindler pointed out, one really has to be almost a pauper to receive legal aid these days. Since being in office, this Government has continuously forgotten about middle income people&mdash;the ordinary people of Australia; those people on $25,000 or $30,000; families with one person working and a couple of kids which are struggling to make their way. This has happened again with respect to these regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument that some form of cost recovery is appropriate in the case of the High Court and the Federal Court can be more tenable than it is in relation to the Family Court and the AAT. This is due to the nature of the cases heard in these forums and the type of applications involved. We accept that in these cases it is appropriate that a small proportion of the total costs of running the justice system is recouped from the users of the system. The imposition of a setting down fee may also quite properly, as you would appreciate as a practitioner, Madam Acting Deputy President, act as a disincentive to the parties to signify readiness for hearing when in fact they are not prepared. If it does act as a disincentive, this will assist the courts in case flow management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Liberal and National parties are concerned that significant hardship could result from the imposition of a setting down fee in the Family Court and in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This concern in relation to the Family Court is shared by the Law Council of Australia and by the Chief Justice of the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A range of applications arise in actions in the Family Court which would be subject to the new fees. Examples of where such payments would be inappropriate include instances where a child is at risk of being snatched and taken interstate or overseas; action to gain proper access to a child where access is being refused by a vindictive custodial parent; action to vary an unreasonable assessment of child support under the Child Support Assessment Act; or action to remove a violent or abusive spouse from the matrimonial home. There are literally dozens of other examples in which the imposition of a setting down fee would be unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw to the attention of the Senate the information given, I think by the Law Council of Australia, as to the typical case costs that could apply with the new fees in a typical Family Court case. My understanding is that these fees are quite relevant and not outrageously exaggerated. An initiating application would be $100; a subsequent application for property settlement would be $100; problems with child custody and access would be $100; an application for discovery would be $50; and a setting down fee would be $500&mdash;making a total of $850. If we then add to that the cost to which you, Madam Acting Deputy President, have drawn a lot of attention in the Estimates Committee of obtaining a transcript&mdash;taking three days as the length of an average trial, 120 pages per day at $6.50 to $8.50 per page, the cost being $780 to $1,020 per day for three days, making the cost of the transcript alone about $8,000&mdash;we are looking at about $8,850 just in court fees paid to the government before we start to look at the fees the lawyers will charge. This might even be amusing when we consider that the Family Court was first introduced as a court where no fees at all were payable; where justice could be obtained quickly, inexpensively and without all the rigmarole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I refer again to the AAT. We agree that the regulations in relation to that tribunal should also be disallowed. That is on the basis that, with the nature of the tribunal and the often smaller claims involved, it would seem absurd to charge a setting down fee even at the reduced rate of $200 and even with a proviso that it would be refundable to successful applicants. The fact remains that if one is dealt with capriciously by a government department one would not be able to proceed with one's AAT hearing unless one comes up with the $200 fee to have one's case set down. Whilst Senator Tate says that there are not quite so many tax applications now, as I raised in the Estimates Committee, one does on occasions have the need to appeal tax decisions. They may not be for very large amounts, but if one is forking out $200 every time one wants to have an assessment looked at it certainly provides a huge disincentive to proceed to try to obtain justice in relation to one's taxation matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For these reasons, the coalition will be supporting the disallowance of regulations which impose a setting down fee on the Family Court and the AAT, but we will not be supporting the disallowance of those regulations which establish a setting down fee in relation to the High Court and the Federal Court of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Macdonald in his remarks and make a few brief remarks of my own. These regulations were gazetted on 19 December and are due to take effect on 1 April of this year. Perhaps that date is rather significant. This fee increase arose from a review of fees in the Commonwealth courts and tribunals by a number of departments and bodies, including the Attorney-General's Department and the various courts and tribunals. However, I will contain my remarks specifically to the Family Court of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act, I find the issue of increased fees quite inappropriate. Senator Spindler is on that Committee and I note that in his press release put out the other day he challenged the Opposition parties to support him. I do not quite know whether we are supporting Senator Spindler or he is actually supporting us in a couple of parts of the disallowance, but in his press release he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Exemptions in the regulations do cover people receiving legal aid and others at the lower end of the income scale. However, that does not cover the large number of people who do not meet the stringent legal aid criteria but still cannot afford the steeply rising costs of our legal system.</PARA>
<PARA>I think Senator Macdonald has also alluded to that. Although a Senate committee is investigating the cost of justice, quite large numbers of people have also seen fit to raise the issue of fees in relation to family law with the Committee looking into the interpretation of the Family Law Act. A very common story, which has been repeated everywhere we have convened in Australia, is that so often the value of the property of a marriage is totally or largely eroded by the paying out of quite extensive legal fees, let alone now putting fees into instruments in the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the Federal Labor Government at this time of severe recession to attack those who are least able to afford to pay the increased fees is totally inappropriate. The fees imposed in the Family Court include $100 for originating applications; $50 for interlocutory applications; $500 for full court appeals in child support matters; and $100 for appeals from magistrates, registrars and judicial registrars. These fees will all come on top of those charged by legal counsel engaged by the applicant for divorce. I know that Senator Macdonald gave a couple of examples where it would be clearly inappropriate for fees to be paid by a litigant in the Family Court. I mention several more examples: enforcing proper access orders being disobeyed by a custodial parent; determining what is in the genuine best interests of a child; stopping a child from being physically assaulted; preventing sexual interference with and abuse of a child; and obtaining urgent maintenance for a child or spouse. I believe it is totally inappropriate, particularly at this time of economic downturn with record numbers of unemployed and a rising divorce rate, to talk of increasing fees at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition to the new fees does not just come from the politicians; the Law Council of Australia is also totally opposed to them. It is of the view that it is the right of all citizens to have access on as equal a basis as possible to the courts provided by the Government. The Law Council argues that it is the responsibility of the Government to provide a system of justice funded from general revenue for all citizens who may need to use that system. The family law section of the Law Council and the Chief Justice of the Family Court have been particularly concerned about the impact of these new regulations. Divorce is difficult enough without making it an option purely for the financially able, as Senator Macdonald alluded to a little while ago. Justice is supposed to be available equally to all, and clearly this is not the case with these regulations which make justice affordable only to the better off in society. That is not justice and that is not equitable. On those grounds, the regulations as enunciated by Senator Macdonald ought to be disallowed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, with your indulgence I will be brief and general in my comments. I support the comments made by my colleagues on the disallowance regulations in respect of the AAT and the Family Court. I have long held the view that the general principle that courts of law ought to be available to all citizens is one that is frankly not true in Australia now and nor has it been for a very long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The capacity to get justice depends upon the capacity to pay. There are a number of reasons of course for that, but it is one of the great inequities of modern Australian society that if one finds oneself tempted to be involved in litigation one inevitably has to ask how much it will cost, what capacity one has to pay and what capacity the other person has to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one takes action against a very wealthy corporation or a very wealthy citizen, inevitably and invariably the advice one receives is to try to settle out of court. That is simply because one does not have equal access. In this day and age one does not have to go to the High Court; one could find oneself in either a district court or the Supreme Court. If a QC is involved the costs could be at least $25,000 a day. If one wants the best advocates, that is simply what one has to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are probably many reasons for that, but on the question of access to legal advice itself I think it was the Chief Justice of Western Australia who said that the price of justice is way beyond the scope of many Western Australian citizens and that lawyers' fees contributed significantly to that. Many of the larger law firms had geared themselves for business with large corporations. They structured themselves in such a way&mdash;offices and facilities&mdash;that their hourly costs were driven up and, therefore, an ordinary citizen had to share the burden of those costs if he or she wanted proper access to that firm's advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought that Senator Tate was a man of the people until he was elevated to his present position.

<PARA>The arguments about the personal hardship due to high legal costs and the consequent denial of access to justice apply also to the new $500 fees the Government seeks to impose in the Federal Court and High Court. For example, some people wishing to appeal decisions in the freedom of information, broadcast, customs and social security areas may find that the $500 fee prevents them from bringing such an appeal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example would be an application by an aggrieved individual taking on a corporation under the Trade Practices Act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the High Court any matter before it has to be one of public importance. I would argue that it is against basic principles of social justice to impose an additional $500 setting down fee on individuals already facing enormous fees for the determination of a matter which has importance for both the individual and the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret that the coalition parties are not supporting my disallowance motions to disallow the regulations imposing fees, or seeking to impose fees, in the Federal Court and High Court.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again I briefly thank the coalition for supporting my motions of disallowance of those regulations&mdash;in particular, Senator Brownhill, who I know, as he sits with me on a number of inquiries dealing with these matters, is particularly concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the motion to disallow certain fees to be paid in relation to matters in the High Court and the Federal Court, as already alluded to or indicated in Senator Spindler's speech, it is possible&mdash;and no doubt the Opposition is relying on this possibility&mdash;to distinguish between the general run of those who might come before the Family Court or the AAT and those who pursue a matter before the High Court or the Federal Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks again at the very generous description of those who would not need to pay the fees that are sought to be imposed by this particular regulation, one can see that it is framed in a way which does not do what people would rightly be able to object to; that is, deny access to these important courts in our Federal system for those who need to have a particular dispute resolved with all the full authority and status of a judge of the Federal Court or a justice of the High Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect Senator Macdonald was right to indicate in his remarks that a small proportion of the costs&mdash;and it is a very small proportion of the costs&mdash;of providing for the operation of these courts ought to be recovered from those litigants before either of those courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also interested in some earlier remarks made by Senator Spindler to the effect that he could support the idea that in those cases where, for example, one has two major corporations seeking to carry a major battle over boardroom control into the courts, or a major taxation matter involving a huge corporation with plenty of resources, a case could be made out, as Senator Spindler was beginning to, that one could even have full cost recovery in those cases so that where the courts are utilised in that way by those major corporations to resolve disputes, which is another way of trying to resolve the dispute, they could make full payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thinks of the new arbitration arrangements that are emerging, and I know Senator Durack has taken a keen interest in that. I think Sir Laurence Street, in relation to commercial arbitration matters both within Australia and internationally in our region, has been at the forefront of those who have sought to provide a system for resolving disputes that does not require an exercise of the judicial power but rather some sort of arbitration between the parties concerned. No doubt they pay very fully for the opportunity to use that particular way to resolve the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I might take Senator Spindler's hint. I might further build on the fact that Senator Macdonald has said that some small proportion of the total cost is properly recoverable. How small or how large a proportion is something that could be the subject of further discussion. I do believe that the fees set down here were arrived at in the context of setting down hearing fees for Family Court, AAT, Federal Court and High Court matters. It may well be that $500 for a hearing in the Federal Court of Australia when one is paying thousands of dollars a day for counsel is not an extravagant amount at all. It could well be increased to help defray the costs which are otherwise borne by the ordinary taxpayers of Australia. I am sure they would not quibble with the provision of the Federal Court and High Court of Australia, but perhaps they would rightly feel that if major corporations were to make use of these social institutions to resolve disputes, they ought to pay a very considerable amount towards the cost of operating those particular social institutions to help them conduct business in what they judge to be their interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do believe that these particular fees to be imposed in relation to those who can afford to pay in the Federal Court and High Court should be supported by the Senate. I believe it is no great imposition. It is certainly not a denial of access to justice, and I believe, at least in this instance, that these particular regulations should be supported and the motion to disallow should be opposed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) There are no plans to increase the number of migrants from the former Soviet Union simply because of the prospect of a terrible winter. However, to ensure the fairest access to Australia's migration programs for citizens of the former Soviet Union while also making provision for repressed minorities, who may need our assistance, the Government has undertaken two things this year. One is to provide a share of places among the 4,000 the Minister recently announced under the new Special Assistance category for people who are members of ethnic minorities in the former Soviet Union. The Special Assistance category was created in recognition of the continuing strong community support for the humanitarian component of our migration program and is designed to ensure that Australia can respond to special circumstances without being constrained by problems of definition. The disarray in government services delivery within the new republics makes Special Assistance numbers from the former Soviet Union this year uncertain. However, the selection of people under the new category will target those in greatest need of assistance. It will focus on the degree of distress an individual has suffered as a result of severe civil disorder or violence or because he or she is a member of a disadvantaged or repressed minority, and also on the extent of the person's links with Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second Government initiative this year has been to set up a travel loan fund to help up to 6,000 migrants come here from Eastern Europe (including the former USSR), who meet normal selection criteria for the Independent Category. The Minister announced last year that the travel loan fund scheme will operate for a three year period and that migrants will be expected to repay loans over a two year period starting six months after their arrival in Australia. The travel loan fund was set up in recognition of the serious practical barriers currency restrictions in the former USSR and other East European countries impose on skilled migration from these countries and to ensure that Australia is not denied access to a highly skilled group of people being actively sought by other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Between 1945 and 1955 approximately 457,000 European migrants (excluding those from the United Kingdom and Ireland) arrived for a permanent or long-term stay in Australia.</PARA>
