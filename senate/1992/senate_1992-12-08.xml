Many of these documents are from the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories and affect my portfolio responsibility. I am very disheartened by this lumping. I have received a note from our Whip saying that this situation is understood. I discussed the matter with our Leader, who was not aware of any problem with my raising it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The reason for the bunching up of these reports is that, when the extra week and extra day of sitting were arranged, there was no allowance made for reports to be dealt with. The provisions of the resolution determining what business could be constructed on those days excluded reports, hence the bunching up now. We will have only 30 minutes to speak to these documents today, but any of them can continue through to the extra half hour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a desire, perversely, to get some of these matters dealt with this week and not next week because the real complaint was that there is more rushing in the last week. There are still quite a few departmental reports to come in, mostly because they are awaiting certification from the Auditor-General, which has held them up. The Government acknowledges that it is not desirable to put down 42 reports in one go, but a lot of the build-up has been because they were precluded previously under the order of business for the extra days. I do not know whether there will be a lot tomorrow or the next day. If not, the Opposition can work its way through these over the next two or three days.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tabling of this report, A Review of Australia's Efforts to Promote and Protect Human Rights, is a significant event for the Australian Parliament. It is the first comprehensive report on human rights to the Parliament and, as such, recognises the growing importance and the growing acceptance of human rights as a central issue in both domestic and international politics.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a good deal of rhetoric around on this subject and like all things there can be a danger of overkill. I would hope that this will not be the case with human rights because in the end our adherence to the principles and our promotion of those principles, are a measure of our civilisation. Human rights are central to the purposes of government&mdash;the purpose of providing a rule of law that is just and fair, not arbitrary or partisan; that substitutes for the raw and violent use of power institutions which will peacefully reconcile conflicts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If human rights are about the provision of laws that are just and recognise the intrinsic dignity of people then they are a noble pursuit of great importance to this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was Amnesty which perceived the need for a more focused and formalised reporting mechanism on human rights issues. They wrote to the Committee in September 1990 proposing that some mechanism be established whereby the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade should provide an annual report to Parliament on his Department's work in this field and that this report should be referred to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for examination. The intention was to `expand parliamentary responsibility and community support for the continued development of human rights protection'. The emphasis was to be on the record of the Australian Government in its activities to promote and protect, not an examination either of individual cases or of the human rights records of other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Human Rights Sub-Committee was established in May 1991 as a permanent Sub-Committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Its first reference received in May 1991  was to inquire into and report on Australia's international efforts to promote and protect human rights. In November 1991 the first annual report on human rights was received from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. This became the basis of the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry generated wide interest and the Sub-Committee itself has quickly become the focus of attention for many groups in Australia who are concerned, often because of ethnic ties, with the many human rights abuses in the world. While this was not intended to be the central work of the Committee and, in many ways it is not equipped to deal with the volume of material that is provided to it, it is probably an inevitable extension of its work and recognises an earnestly felt need in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry received 89 submissions many of which contained voluminous and comprehensive information about human rights situations around the world. Public hearings were held in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra between December 1991 and June 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Central to the inquiry has been an examination of the ways in which the Federal Government has incorporated its human rights principles into policy and practice at an international level&mdash;the incorporation of human rights into foreign policy, defence cooperation and aid policies. The Committee looked at the international structures established by the United Nations to promote human rights and examined Australia's relations with these organisations and our ratification of and compliance with the international human rights treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry was told in no uncertain terms that Australia had failed in significant areas by placing reservations on a number of articles in important human rights Covenants and Conventions. These articles relate to the passing of legislation outlawing racial vilification, the separation of adults and juveniles in gaols and those articles which allow individuals to make complaints to the various human rights committees. The failure to ratify these articles has detracted from our position on human rights, it reflects weaknesses in our record and may inhibit the full exercise of rights within Australia. If we are to speak with any authority on human rights these omissions should be rectified. The Committee recommends that this is done without delay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most critical and controversial question that arose in the inquiry was whether there should be a linkage between aid or trade and investment and the human rights records of recipient countries. Australia has taken the view so far that this issue should be decided on a case by case basis because the circumstances are complicated and the results of such linkages hard to govern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has not been unsympathetic to this view for a number of reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is very aware of the trend, since the end of the Cold War, of increasing linkages between human rights and aid. However, many of the countries which are making the link do so from a position of strength where the impact of such a link is substantial. The European Community through the European Council has a common cultural history which makes consensus, and therefore concerted action, a relatively easy task; the United States can make unilateral decisions on aid and human rights and often has done so with great effect; Japan is currently in a similar position of strength and has recently developed guidelines for the relationship between military expenditures and aid donations; the multilateral banks&mdash;the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and also the United Nations Development Program are all talking of setting a ratio of military to social expenditure as one of the criteria for assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would support such linkages in principle and indeed where international action can be achieved Australia should support it. However, Australia is in a unique position vis a vis the implementation of such policies. We are not a large power easily able to make an impact through the withdrawal of aid or the imposition of trade sanctions, nor have we found it straightforward to find regional support for the human rights principles we wish to promote.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless we should not sell ourselves short. The Australian economy, measured in the size of GDP, is in the top 20 nations of the world. Moreover, recent initiatives such as APEC, the peace settlement in Cambodia, the Chemical Test Ban Treaty, the Cairns Free Trade Group and its consequent impact on GATT and the Antarctic treaty have established for Australia a credibility which can be used to raise human rights issues effectively with other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would seem imperative for us to seek to build regional consensus on what constitutes good governance and to do this either informally as at present through dialogue and representation or more formally through a regional forum which would be able to keep the discussion going with a view to developing a regional understanding. No doubt within the terms of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the major human rights covenants and conventions there is room for discussion which could produce a view of human rights applicable to this region. The Committee recommends that the Government explore the possibility of establishing such a regional forum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the meantime, the Committee supported the view of many submissions that the aid program could make contributions to better observance of human rights through a proactive policy within the aid program. Many of the suggestions were innovative and practical.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first public hearing of the Human Rights Sub-Committee was held on 2 December, made necessary by the tragic situation of the massacre in Dili on 12 November 1991. On that occasion the Committee took oral evidence from Mr Bob Muntz, the Community Aid Abroad worker who was injured during the shooting in Dili, written evidence from Russell Anderson, Amy Goodman and Allan Nairn, three other Western eyewitnesses to the killings, as well as statements from Amnesty International and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This hearing was an unusual one created by unusual circumstances. The intention was not to conduct a definitive inquiry into what happened in Timor but to place factual information about the events of 12 November 1991 on the public record. The Committee does not expect to conduct hearings of this kind into the many and dreadful human rights abuses that occur in the world. However, it may from time to time have such hearings on matters of public interest to Australians. Timor fell into this category because of its proximity, its historical links with Australia, its sizeable refugee community living here and because of the interest that exists over our policy regarding Indonesia. The Committee was able to send the evidence collected that day to the Djaelani Commission investigating the incident in Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further eyewitness account was given to the Committee by Major-General Chamlong Srimaung, the leader of the pro-democracy forces in Thailand. The Major-General was arrested by the military government during the demonstrations in May 1992. He spoke to the Committee about the demonstrations and the shooting of civilians by the army. On 14 May, Lyndal and Sophie Barry and Patricia Garcia gave first hand accounts of the refugee situation on the borders of Burma.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All other hearings were conducted in response to the submissions received. A very great volume of material was received by the Committee on the human rights abuses that are occurring in many parts of the world. We were overwhelmed by the extent and range of the problems described to us. Neither the resources available to the secretariat nor the time frame set for the inquiry has allowed the cases to be examined comprehensively. Nor has the Committee been able to seek information on situations which we know are occurring in other parts of the world, which are as severe as those presented to us, but which for one reason or another were not formally brought to the Committee's attention. Therefore, there is an ad hoc list of situations dealt with in the last three chapters of the report. However, given the very great concern of very many people who put this material to the Committee, we have been at pains to portray accurately what has been told to us and to set out the requests for help and the recommendations for action that have been made to us. We do not pretend that this section of the report represents the final analysis of the last year's human rights situation for the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is very aware of the delicacy and sensitivity of the issue of human rights. We had to hold a number of hearings in-camera because the evidence being given would have put people at risk. This brought home to members that human rights is still a matter of life and death for many people around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important function of the Human Rights Sub-Committee is, through debate, to clarify and enunciate the nature and role of human rights in international relations. With the establishment of this Sub-Committee, human rights are on the political agenda and that is important.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to thank the Members of the Committee for all the time and effort spent on this inquiry. Finally the Committee Members extend their appreciation to the members of the Secretariat, Denise Picker for her work in the organisation of public and private hearings, Margaret Brown for her assistance in the preparation of the report and in particular Margaret Swieringa, the Secretary of the Sub-Committee whose work in compiling this report has been invaluable.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I point out to the Senate that this Government claims that the local capital works program announced in the Budget will create 13,000 jobs, but it has absolutely no way of proving that figure or of ensuring that the funding it has given to local government under this program will actually be used to create jobs. Estimates Committee B was reconvened to look at the expenditure by the Government under Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4 of 1992. Under these Bills $55m is allocated to the local capital works program which was announced in the Budget. When announcing this program the Government stated that it would generate 13,000 new jobs over the next two years. This statement was a misrepresentation of the truth, to put it politely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Committee hearings coalition members questioned the Government and the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs on the progress of the local capital works program to date, in order to justify the additional expenditure on this program under these Bills. The result of the questioning was far from satisfactory, as we expected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government made this $345m program the centrepiece of its job creation program in the Budget. The Government stated that the program was a genuine attempt to address the problems of serious unemployment in regional areas. However, a major fault of the program is that it is not a requirement for councils to employ people who are currently unemployed. This is where the Government has deceived the unemployed people of Australia. It is not the fault of local councils; it is the fault of this ALP Government. By trumpeting during the Budget debate that 13,000 jobs would be generated under this program, the Government gave hope to the unemployed that 13,000 fewer of them would be struggling on the dole queues. This was not to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When questioned on the exact number of previously unemployed people who had acquired a job under this program, the Department replied that it could not provide such figures because `it was not an employment program', and it did not see such figures in relation to unemployed people being taken on. Clearly, therefore, the Government has misrepresented this program to the Australian people. This misrepresentation has given false hope to many of Australia's unemployed. A typical case was presented in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> on 30 November this year under the heading `Job Sham'. The case which was highlighted in the article was that of an unemployed 20-year-old, Ben Sullivan, of Byron Bay. The Byron Bay Council was given $1.2m under the local capital works program. It has spent $400,000 so far, but not one new job has been created from this expenditure. The money has been spent on the reconstruction of a footpath in the main street using council labour. When Ben Sullivan was asked whether his predicament had been eased by the money received by the local council, he is quoted as saying, `What money? I didn't realise it was money meant to create jobs for us'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Byron Bay example appears to be typical of the expenditure under the local capital works program. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> reported on 1 December 1992 that a similar lack of job creation had occurred under this program in the Hunter Valley. The Lord Mayor of Newcastle was quoted as saying that there was no guarantee that the work created under the program would go to the unemployed in his area. Singleton Shire said it would be using no unemployed people in spending the $400,000 grant that it had received&mdash;neither will Dungog Shire, when it spends its $200,000, nor will the Port Stephens and Muswellbrook local council areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this is the case across Australia, and I very much suspect it is, it is clear that the Government's statement that 13,000 jobs will be generated is a complete fiction. It must be remembered that it is not local government that is at fault here; it has been spending money allocated to it in ways that are perfectly justified under the guidelines to the program. The problem lies with the fact that sufficient guidelines have not been laid down by the Federal Government under this program to ensure that the $345m is being spent in the way that the Government originally intended. The Government should be wholeheartedly condemned for leading the Australian people on with the hope that something was actually going to be done about the 13,000 people on the dole queue and the opportunities that they may have to get into productive employment when it was never going to be the case&mdash;nor did the Government have any intention that it would be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the first three of the four Bills in this package&mdash;that is, the Sex Discrimination and other Legislation Amendment Bill 1992, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 and the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Amendment Bill 1992&mdash;and to basically put down the Opposition's position in relation to these pieces of legislation. I understand my colleague Senator Short will be speaking to the somewhat unrelated matter of the Commonwealth Superannuation Schemes Amendment Bill 1992, which is being debated cognately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These three Bills might be described as part of Labor's agenda on equal opportunity and affirmative action. There is much in the package with which the Opposition agrees; unfortunately, however, the Bills do not address what we think are the major concerns of women in the Australian community at the moment. The major interest of women at the moment is in fact to get employment, as many have suffered within the overall figure of a million Australians out of work as a result of Labor's policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly my colleague Senator Newman, who will be addressing this package also, in many ways is better qualified from her considerable dialogue with women around the country to report directly on the expressions of women to her, but I am sure that at the moment the first consideration of women out there in the community is the lack of work, the lack of job opportunities for their spouses and the lack of job opportunities for their children. They will be particularly worrying about the school leavers that will be coming on to the labour market in such desperate circumstances in only a few weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beyond that, women will talk about their concerns regarding a lack of appropriate education, particularly skills and job training both for themselves and, again, for their families. They will talk about their difficulty with child-care, the lack of child-care opportunities and the fact that such opportunities seem, unfortunately under this Government's program, to go to the better off, particularly in cities such as this one. They will talk about their worry about not being able to pay for private health care when they see that one of their first responsibilities is to ensure the provision of adequate health care for their families. They will talk about their frustration in not having the same superannuation opportunities as men within the work force, despite all the reforms we have seen in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They will talk about the fact that so many small businesses&mdash;a third in fact&mdash;are run by women and about their frustrations within small business: the lack of demand for their products because of Labor's recession and their frustration and disappointment at having made a commitment to their small businesses only to find them failing under the economic failure within the country as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We speak to rural women, who have found the going particularly difficult in recent years. They have worries for their children's schooling as they see schools disappearing from the farming areas of the country, and about insufficient recognition of the cost burdens and the social stresses of having to send children to cities for education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Migrant women are concerned about the difficulty of getting language training. Older women are worried about health care and about the fact that they did not have the superannuation opportunities that men did and therefore are concerned about how they will maintain themselves during their senior years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These, I think I can say confidently, are the issues that will be raised by Australian women before the issues that are encompassed within these pieces of legislation. I do not want to start this brief presentation by being particularly critical of Labor's priorities because some of these packages in relation to sex discrimination are very important, but I think, when we look at the overall record of 10 years of Labor government and how it has affected women, we will see that the areas of frustration and disappointment that I have outlined and that Senator Newman will enlarge upon are those that women will put as their first priorities. It is that distorted priority that is so disappointing after 10 years of Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to Labor's agenda&mdash;that is, the package of reforms that is before us for debate today. I will start with the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Amendment Bill 1992. We will not oppose this Bill. The Act requires employers to introduce affirmative action programs and procedures designed to promote equal opportunity for women in the workplace and to eliminate discrimination against women in employment matters. The Act has, of course, been subject to a number of recent reviews, including one by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which entitled its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS>. That Committee strongly endorsed the concept of equal opportunity for women in the workplace. Of course, that is something which is also strongly endorsed by the coalition parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Government's response to the report, a commitment was given that the Government would legislate to give the Director of the Affirmative Action Agency the power to vary reporting requirements where organisations have demonstratively complied with the Act over a period of time, and to extend the operation of the Act to cover voluntary bodies employing 100 or more people. The present exclusion for voluntary bodies is removed so that organisations, such as private schools and charitable institutions, which employ 100 or more people will be relevant employers and will be required to develop affirmative action programs. We are not opposing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill varies the status of the Affirmative Action Agency. That is an aspect which we are unhappy with. We do not think that it needs to be structured into a statutory body with defined functional responsibilities. We believe that those responsibilities can be more than adequately handled either within the Attorney-General's Department or within the Department of Industrial Relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned about the proliferation of new structures of statutory authority and, therefore, although this may give the Government some sort of additional rhetorical armament, we think that it does not advance the interests of women any further. The third change, which gives the Affirmative Action Agency the power to waive the public reporting requirements&mdash;which I mentioned a moment ago&mdash;where there has been reasonable compliance with the requirements of the Act for at least three years, has our support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said a moment ago, I want to stress that whilst we have had reservations about aspects of this legislation over the years&mdash;I mentioned a reservation about this Bill in itself&mdash;nevertheless, the coalition strongly supports and is committed to equal opportunity for all people in the workplace. We intend to use the opportunity of a second reading amendment to reiterate that commitment. That amendment, which I understand has been circulated and which I will move, reiterates our support for the concept of equal employment opportunity for all employees. It also calls upon the Government to support the recruitment, training and promotion of all employees solely on the basis of merit. I trust that the Government, even within its philosophical constraints, will feel that it can support that amendment. We would like to think it is something that would be supported by all Australians. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At end of motion, add ", but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)reaffirms its commitment to the principle of equal opportunity for all employees; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)calls on the Government to support the recruitment, training and promotion of all employees solely on the basis of merit".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second piece of legislation is the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992, which we are supporting. It consists of amendments to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act and also to the Sex Discrimination Act. In relation to the former, it provides for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner within the Commission. This was one of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. As you may recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, we generally welcomed the recommendations of the final report of that Commission and the Government's response thereto. We specifically support the recommendation to establish this Commissioner. We hope that the Commissioner will be able to better serve the interests of that particular community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment proposed by the legislation is the elimination of discrimination involving the dismissal of employees on the ground of family responsibilities. I understand that this is in line with International Labour Organisation convention 156. This convention, which covers equal opportunities and equal treatment for men and women workers with family responsibilities, was ratified by Australia in 1990. Although the coalition has reservations about some of the ILO's conventions, this convention and the content of this amendment are very much in line with the coalition's attitude towards families and our responsibilities to families. In that the amendment makes it unlawful for discrimination on the basis of family responsibilities, we are pleased to support it. It is consistent with our fundamental view that important factors in employment such as talent, ability, diligence and family responsibilities are just as relevant as other factors such as race, gender and marital status.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third Bill in the package is the Sex Discrimination and other Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. The majority of the changes within this legislation are also supported. Let me briefly deal with the important parts that we are supporting and then I will touch upon our few concerns. The first amendment seeks to broaden the definition of sexual harassment. Whilst we understand the Government's motivation, sexual harassment will now be defined to mean `an unwelcome sexual advance, an unwelcome request for sexual favours or other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature in circumstances in which a reasonable person would have anticipated that the person harassed would be offended, humiliated or intimidated'. We put on the record that we are concerned that this is a very vague definition. When rights and responsibilities flow from definitions, we strongly hold the view that it is important that definitions be precise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have noted that there has been particular concern expressed by such bodies as the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It has said that it would prefer to see a definition which specifies that conduct amounts to sexual harassment where a reasonable person would have found the conduct grossly offensive, humiliating or intimidating, or if the conduct satisfies a disadvantage test. That argument is somewhat persuasive. But having expressed reservations, we are not going to vote against the extension of this definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment which we support is designed to help people who have made a complaint under an anti-discrimination law and are then victimised. Not surprisingly, we strongly oppose victimisation that might follow from the making of such a complaint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area in which we will not be opposing the Government's proposals is in relation to the enforcement of a determination of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Again we have some reservations in this regard. It is a move away from the conciliation process, which was the basis of the legislation, to something much more legalistic and provides for appeals to the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not oppose this proposal on the basis that the current requirement is that if one is dissatisfied with the Commission one could start the process again in the Federal Court, which would simply lead to a repetition of the hearing. So, on balance, we will not vote against it. But we express the reservation about heading down the strict legal path as opposed to the commonsense conciliation approach, which was very much the spirit of the initial legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are two areas which we cannot accept in this Bill and which I indicate at this stage that we will oppose. The first is the extension of the Bill to cover Federal industrial awards. At present, the Act does not apply to an act done by a person in direct compliance with an industrial award. This Bill introduces a new section designed to extend the Act to cover such awards. The new procedure will involve a person's complaining to the Sex Discrimination Commissioner that a person has committed a discriminatory act under an award. Unless the Commissioner is of the view that the complaint is frivolous, vexatious, misconceived or lacking in substance, he or she must then refer it to the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are of the view that it is inappropriate for the IR Commission to deal with this question of discrimination and that it is inappropriate for this legislation to be expanded in this way. If one has a complaint about discrimination the remedies, as we know, are already in existence in the legislation. It is unwarranted to start trying to blend together the two responsibilities of the IR Commission and the Sex Discrimination Commissioner. In other words, we do not think a case has been made by the Government for this claimed reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also be opposing the provisions in respect of representative complaints. We believe that the further extension is unnecessary. Coalition members who were parties to the House of Representatives report on the subject, which I mentioned a moment ago, put in a minority report on this matter. You may well be aware of that, Mr Acting Deputy President. The Opposition is consistent with the view that was expressed at that time. You would know from recent experience with other legislation the concerns that we have had about the Government's design for representative actions, which we believe are basically heading in the wrong direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we will support most of the reforms the Government wants to introduce. As I said, there are a couple that we cannot support and there are a couple about which we have reservations. However, I finish where I started: the major problems faced by Australian women are not those included within this package; they are out there in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge Australian women to take the opportunity to read the coalition's Fightback program in relation to women. See what we say about providing them with the jobs that they are not getting at the moment; how we can improve the education opportunities for women through our programs; how we can particularly help rural women and migrant women who are discriminated against within our community, especially in relation to language; how we can give support to women in small business who have worked so hard but have suffered under this Government; and how we can provide another $90m for child-care opportunities for women who want to get into the work force but find that they cannot afford to, whilst at the same time providing the type of child-care they want for their children. If they read that package, I am sure they will agree with me that there is a better opportunity for them out there. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report reveals that women's wages in Australia are currently, on average, 87 per cent of average male wages; women make up only 13 per cent of government representatives in Australia; since the inception of the Australian honours system in 1975, women have received only 24 per cent of all awards and they generally have been in the lower orders; more than half of the women in the paid work force in Australia earn less than $21,000 a year, while two-thirds of men have incomes greater than that figure; Australia has one of the most sex segregated work forces in the OECD countries; and there is the infamous `glass ceiling' which is demonstrated by the fact that Australia's senior business managers, public servants and professionals are five to 10 times more likely to be men than women. So, as the Committee noted, the battle for equality is far from being won. I think it is important to keep in mind that the changes we have before us today are directed as much towards cultural change as towards remedying specific problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main changes introduced by the Bill is the extension of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to Federal industrial awards and certified agreements. At present, discriminatory actions carried out in accordance with the terms and conditions of an award are exempt from the Sex Discrimination Act. Under this Bill, a complaint alleging discrimination under an award may be lodged with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it appears to the Sex Discrimination Commissioner that the act is a discriminatory one, the Commissioner must then refer the award to the Industrial Relations Commission. The Sex Discrimination Commissioner is then given standing as a party as the award is reviewed. If the IRC finds the award is discriminatory, it must take the necessary steps to remove the discrimination by setting aside or varying the award. However, the IRC is not required to take action which it believes would not be in the public interest. The Australian Democrats welcome these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also widens the current definition of sexual harassment, and there have been many concerns expressed about this, with some people claiming that it could be rather subjective or open to abuse. I do not pretend that this area is not a very difficult one. We certainly are aware of the difficulty involved in sorting out truth from fiction when there are allegations of sexual harassment. Basically, it comes down to the word of one person against another but, more often than not, unfortunately, it is the word of a woman who is claiming to have been harassed against the word of a man denying the allegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few things have to be said about these situations, and they are the exception to the rule. They have been given prominence by some recent very public cases such as the specific case of Thomas v. Hill in the United States. Despite all the hysteria that tends to be generated, particularly by the critics of this type of legislation, these situations are not the most common. Of the many complaints made to the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, the vast majority are settled by conciliation. In other words, there are very few cases where the two parties remain intransigent and hold their line right to the wire, and where there is absolutely no supporting evidence from anybody else. This is, in part, an unforeseen reflection on the environments in which sexual harassment occurs because such harassment rarely goes totally unnoticed by anybody; in fact, it is frequently the subject of office gossip&mdash;sometimes people are prepared to do something about it; sometimes they are not&mdash;or it has been observed by others who might find it very embarrassing or humorous. Perhaps people are reluctant to speak up because they are worried about their position in the office, a promotion or are afraid of losing their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fairly rare, as is the experience of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, to have a case where nobody saw, heard or knew anything of the case and where it comes down to the word of one person against another. Such cases do occur and they are the ones that make the public arena. They are also well-publicised. We must be sensible and realistic about this: they are not common and they can occur in any jurisdiction, not just this one.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not mean that it is the fault of the jurisdiction or the legislation; there is simply very little we can do in any jurisdiction to stop people being vindictive or vexatious in their dealings with one another if they are determined to behave that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Critics of this legislation also like to imply that it means people cannot banter or flirt with anyone of the opposite sex without being accused of sexual harassment. If we read the legislation, we find that to be rubbish&mdash;and they know that it is rubbish. I am not going to say that there are not occasionally double standards as we have all heard stories about that. Those attitudes are not very helpful. Most people, and certainly most women, know the difference between banter and harmless fun or sexual harassment. Most women can deal with what I would call mild harassment. They may find it irritating and juvenile, but they can deal with it. We know the difference between that annoying level of behaviour and the sort of behaviour which is designed to offend, humiliate or intimidate us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also the case that harassment is generally linked to power, and this is again where women do have some difficulties. This power difference is highly relevant&mdash;for example, a woman might be able to stop harassment from a fellow employee, but when it comes down to an employer or someone in a senior position it can be very difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill says that harassment must, firstly, be an unwelcome sexual advance or an unwelcome request for sexual favours or other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature and, secondly, that that sort of conduct must occur:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in circumstances in which a reasonable person, having regard to all the circumstances, would have anticipated that the person harassed would be offended, humiliated or intimidated.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats think that this is a fair test and will be supporting these changes. Another measure the Democrats support is the extension of the application of the Sex Discrimination Act. I will go very quickly through the way in which it is extended. It is extended to the provision of goods, services and facilities; to clubs; to the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs; and to dealings in connection with the land and the provision of accommodation. The Bill also makes changes in the area of representative complaints. The Sex Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and the Disability Discrimination Act are all amended to make it easier for a representative&mdash;or class&mdash;complaint to be commenced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several preconditions for making a representative complaint. The Commission has the power to reject such a complaint. The Opposition is opposing the representative complaint provisions, basically because they do not seem to support subsuming individual rights into class rights. The Australian Democrats will not be supporting the Opposition's amendments. I think there are instances where a group action would be more cost effective for all concerned but we particularly need to look at taxpayers as well as individuals. It makes little sense to have several individuals pursuing very similar, if not the same, issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I realise the class can be very broad, although I note that any determination as a consequence of such a complaint must describe or identify the class members to which it will apply. Of course, there will be some problems with the opt-out system, but ultimately it is more practical than the other way around. I believe the provisions under which the Commission can reject a representative complaint provide a more than adequate protection for ensuring that ridiculous or vexatious actions do not get up as representative complaints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most important things this Bill does is set up a mechanism for enforcing determinations made by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner. Until now, a complainant wanting to enforce a Commission determination had to take action in the Federal Court. This has been the subject of a great deal of criticism from just about every organisation and individual with an interest in the operations of the Commission. It has been a waste of resources and a totally unnecessary duplication which has resulted in increasing costs for all parties, as well as encouraging some respondents to adopt a rather cavalier attitude to the decisions of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new mechanism provides for a determination of the Commission to be registered in the Federal Court. It will then take effect as if it were a Federal Court order. This is a sensible and practical move which is welcomed by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to mention briefly our support for the Commonwealth Superannuation Schemes (Amendment) Bill. Basically, this Bill brings the Commonwealth schemes into compliance with the anti-discrimination legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1984-86 sex discrimination legislation there was a blanket exemption for all funds. In 1991, this total exemption was narrowed down to four. They are: conditions in a fund based on actuarial data, for example, recognising the difference in longevity between the sexes; lesser death and disability benefits being provided to single people relative to those provided to people with dependants; provisions concerning vesting and preservation of portability; and, finally, protection of the existing expectations of members of discriminatory schemes. Currently, the Commonwealth schemes are exempt from these provisions. This legislation brings the Commonwealth schemes into compliance. The Democrats support this move. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our record on matters of importance to women is a good one, ranging from having had the first woman member in each State and Federal Parliament of this country, the first woman Minister in the Federal Parliament, and a long record of supportive legislation over many years. I emphasise that it was a coalition government which in 1980 signed the Copenhagen Convention outlawing all forms of discrimination against women. The three Bills before us today were based on that landmark Convention and our support for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot help but be cynical about the presentation of these Bills today because they are really part of a bigger game plan. Although we support most of the amendments in the Bills, as Senator Hill said, there are some about which we have a few concerns. The real concern is why the Bills are being introduced. We believe they are part of a bigger effort to try to refine the image of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) with women. The Prime Minister hired a consultant, Dr Anne Summers, believed to be at a cost of about $80,000 of taxpayers' money for five months work, to do a facelift on the Prime Minister&mdash;his attempt to woo the women voters. She has tried to make him out as a caring human being. The only trouble is that women have seen him in other guises over many years, often operating like a back street spiv in the gutter.

The images which Australian women have of the Prime Minister, however they are described in this place, will remain in women's minds and cannot be overcome simply by a PR campaign devised at taxpayers' expense.

Unless those feminists are wearing party political specs, they are not going to be fooled by the image makers, either. Both of these attempts by Dr Summers are too contrived and too far from the very real image of the Paul Keating who has strutted the political stage for a couple of decades.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation being amended today is the Sex Discrimination Act, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act and the Affirmative Action (Equal Opportunity for Women) Act. These amendments represent only a handful of the recommendations of the report of the joint parliamentary committee into equal opportunity and equal status for women in Australia. Almost all of the recommendations of that report received all-party support. Yet has Mr Keating committed himself to implementing that report? The answer is no. The major issues remain untouched, despite the fact that that committee recognised what were the important issues that need attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Lavarch, reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 22 July, blamed the slow pace of reform on Ministers, claiming that, while many introduced women's programs with fanfare and publicity, they often lacked the commitment to follow their rhetoric through. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> goes on to say that his claims contradict the recent assertions by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, that the Labor Government had greatly improved the lot of Australian women during its 10 years in power. That would be my view as well. I have no doubt whatsoever that the Chairman is right. There have been great flourishes, great rhetoric and PR claims, but not a lot of action. The issues that the committee was dwelling on were issues of employment, industrial relations, taxation, retirement income, health, education and the needs of rural women, non-English speaking background women and Aboriginal women. Are we seeing any of that in this legislation today? No. But those are issues which are addressed by Fightback. That is why I am very proud to claim that Fightback is pro-women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the Government's record on employment. The Government will claim that it has been good to women because there has been a growth in women's employment. If the Government were not so confined to its ivory tower it would realise that many of those women&mdash;not all&mdash;work because their family's standard of living has been so reduced during the reign of this Government that they need extra financial support. Many women claim that they have lost the right to choose. I consulted with women's organisations around Australia for a year, as a result of which <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Women Speak</EMPHASIS> was produced. Let me quote a couple of women's comments from that little book. Comments like these were made everywhere. One woman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to see a situation where we don't say you're lucky to be able to afford to be at home.</PARA>
<PARA>Another woman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be your right and your choice, your true choice, not denied to those who don't have enough money.</PARA>
<PARA>Even those women who are in the work force have been suffering. We all know of the desperate growth in the unemployment of women. Nearly 400,000 women now show up on the unemployment lists. About 100,000 women are described as `discouraged job seekers'. Nearly 600,000 women are described as having a `marginal attachment' to the work force. One of the alarming pieces of information I was given the other day referred to English language studies. I was told that only 17 per cent of referrals by the CES for English language studies were women. When I asked why there was such a low percentage of women, I was told, `We believe it is simply because women are not registering with the CES'. First of all, they do not believe that the jobs are there to be had and, secondly, if their husbands are in the work force, there is not much point in applying for benefits so they do not bother with the CES. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not forget the impact of payroll tax on employment. The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, is on the record as having said that about 200,000 jobs would be produced if payroll tax were abolished. Only this year it was reported that, for the first time, superannuation costs in the private sector surpassed payroll tax as the major component of labour costs other than earnings. The cost of superannuation cover in the private sector was up 29.5 per cent to $1,140 in 1990-91, compared with $992 an employee for payroll tax. These are the disincentives that keep people from getting jobs. These government imposed taxes, levies and charges are taxes on jobs. There are measures that this Government could take action on to improve the employment opportunities of all Australians, including women. Why does the Government not do so?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have underemployment. Many women in the work force in Australia are in part time work, particularly because it suits those with family responsibilities. What is not showing up in those awful statistics is the fact that for many of those women the hours of their part time work have been considerably reduced. That can have a terrible effect on those families where the spouse has lost his job, especially in those families where that part time work is critical to their well-being. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has failed to take meaningful action on industrial relations, an area which is very important for women. Industrial relations changes will mean flexibility in working hours and conditions, which is extremely important. We hear the Government talk about workers with family responsibilities. There has been no action from this Government on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many recommendations in the Lavarch Committee's report on industrial relations which have not been addressed by the Government's response. This is really important action that would make a big difference to the lives of many Australian women in the work force. Our industrial relations policy allows for negotiations which are important and very valuable to women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need for changes to the taxation system, yet the One Nation statement delivered earlier this year gave no tax support by way of reductions for those earning less than $20,700 a year; 42 per cent of all Australians earn less than that amount, about two-thirds of whom are women. So much for this Government's concern about women. Where it really counts&mdash;in their pockets&mdash;they get no help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the tax threshold were raised from $5,400 to $7,000, as proposed in Fightback, something like 320,000 Australians on low incomes would no longer pay any tax at all. A heavy proportion of women are in that number. In Fightback women also benefit from the doubling of the family allowance for those families which have under $30,000 in family income. Where is the Government's action to help people in those circumstances?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think one of the greatest failures of this Government in terms of women is its sexist superannuation policy. There is no coverage for women with broken work patterns, those caring for children at home, or those who are volunteers in the community. The majority of people in those situations are women. In Fightback the superannuation entitlements for people in that position are wonderful. For the first time there is a real opportunity for those who are not in the paid work force to have access to some form of retirement income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Has this Government done anything about freeing up the retirement age? No, not at all. Fightback will abolish compulsory retirement and allow people to work past retirement age and receive a bonus pension. For every year that they do not retire when they are entitled to a pension, they will be entitled to an 8 per cent larger pension. For the couple of years that people stay on with a work force wage, their pension eventually will be 16 per cent greater than it otherwise would have been. For women&mdash;who have a long life expectancy&mdash;this is a very important and practical measure, the need for which the Government has totally ignored. Yet it brought out a brand spanking new superannuation policy in June this year which condemns women to remain on the pension because it makes no provision for the large number of women who go in and out of the work force continually. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final evidence of the hypocrisy of the Prime Minister is his endorsement the other day of the National Strategy on Violence Against Women. There are very important questions which demand responses from this Government about the strategy. The strategy says that, in order to relieve the oppression of women and to improve their status, discriminatory conditions in superannuation schemes must be removed. Why then has the Prime Minister not done anything about his sexist superannuation policy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategy says that women of non-English speaking backgrounds who are victims of violence are disadvantaged through their lack of knowledge of the English language and a shortage of specialist interpreters. Why then has the Labor Government neglected the needs of migrant women exposed to violence by closing off the options for migrant women to learn English after three years here? Currently around 70,000 people are awaiting vacancies in the programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national strategy says that all governments in Australia must ensure the further development and effective implementation of guidelines for video material which portrays, condones or incites violence against women or degrades women. Why then has the Labor Party refused to foster a community in which women are safe&mdash;firstly, by not acting on the recommendations of the 1988 report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material; secondly, by not supporting Senator Walters's private member's Bill, the Regulation of Video Material Bill 1988; and, thirdly, by not supporting the debate of her Bill currently before the Senate? Why the inconsistency? Why the hypocrisy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national strategy says that income security is essential if a woman is to live free from fear, threat and actuality of violence. Why then does the Labor Party still have no credible policy for long term sustained employment when the record unemployment levels show that nearly 400,000 Australian women are looking for work? Why is it that we have this legislation before us today, important and useful though it may be, yet no attempt has been made to deal with big issues such as retirement income, the choice as to whether young mothers can stay home with their children, violence and economic security? They are the important questions; yet this Government is trying to buy an image for the Prime Minister by responding to just seven recommendations out of the 79 from the parliamentary committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will list some of the recommendations of the Committee. It said that there should be some proposal whereby superannuation could be used to purchase a home. That is in Fightback, and that is a recommendation of the Committee. Another recommendation is that there should be adequate resources for TAFE. Fightback makes major changes and improvements in resources for TAFE. The Committee says that there should be subsidies for petrol for pensioners in rural areas. I draw the Senate's attention to Fightback's removal of the petrol excise, which will allow people in rural areas to access all sorts of services they currently cannot afford to access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommended that there should be qualitative assessment of the Affirmative Action Agency reports. This is very much an issue which the Opposition agrees with. The Committee recommends that there should be help for sole parents through training to get work. Fightback provides for that too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have talked about what Fightback proposes for superannuation, and that is also referred to in the Lavarch Committee's report. I have spoken also of the resources for English language training. Over and over again, Fightback covers those issues and makes proposals to deal with those needs. This Government has been in office for 10 years, and it is still failing to deal with those important issues that are so vital to women in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government seems to be pretty much on one track when it comes to dealing with issues concerning women. This procedure is not confined to women; it is quite normal for this Government. Firstly, if it wants to be seen to be doing something, it hires a consultant. Secondly, it has a conference or two to make it look as if it is doing something. Thirdly, it produces a strategy and has a Minister announce it with a great flourish. Fourthly, it has a busy and expensive media exercise, thanks to the generosity of the taxpayer. Fifthly, it rests on its laurels. That is this Government's five-point plan for trying to deal with anything. It makes it look like action, but, as Mr Lavarch said&mdash;and as I quoted earlier in my speech&mdash;`The rhetoric is better than the action'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Prime Minister believes that women are taken in by this procedure, he is sadly mistaken. They know what the big issues are. They know whom to blame for their problems and for the pain that they and their families are suffering. They know that PR campaigns fix nothing. Sadly, although the Opposition is prepared to support this legislation, we do not do it with great enthusiasm because of the failure of the Government in so many areas of importance to women which affect every part of their daily lives. This is, in a sense, window dressing after the Government has spent 10 years ignoring the very big picture. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the Bill seeks to protect workers with family responsibilities against discrimination by the employer and, as I said, in particular against dismissal by the employer. The provisions cover a situation where an employee has responsibility for the care and support of a member of his or her family. Taking account of changing family patterns, the Bill covers, apart from the obvious dependent child, spouse, and immediate family members&mdash;defined as an adult, child, parent, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling of an employee, or his or her group&mdash;a definition of spouse, which is defined as a former spouse, a de facto spouse, and a former de facto spouse.

I note that, in providing these amendments, the Government has not specifically stipulated that they are based on the implementation, under the external affairs power, of ILO convention 156.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Superannuation Schemes Amendment Bill amends the following superannuation Acts: the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973, the Governor-General Act 1974, the Judges' Pensions Act, the Parliamentary and Judicial Retiring Allowances Act 1973, the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948, the Superannuation Act 1922, and the Superannuation Act 1976. The main change involves removing discrimination between legally married spouses and de facto ones. The Bill will define the criteria for spouse, which will replace the term `widow' or `widower'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will broaden the eligibility for qualification as a spouse. The amendments will also remove the different treatment between a nuptial and an ex-nuptial child for the purposes of revisionary benefits. As I said a few minutes ago, whilst the legislative amendment is expanding the definition of spouse to include de facto relationships, it will not be expanded to recognise same-sex spouses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the points of concern that I have&mdash;and I want to spend a few minutes on it this morning&mdash;is the cost and financial impact not only of this Bill, but the financial impact of unfunded superannuation liabilities as they apply across Australia and across the world. This is a problem that needs to be addressed at all levels of government in Australia. Again, the Bill gives us an opportunity to debate this growing problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has not provided any costing of the financial impact of the amendments, even though it claims that the cost will be very small. I am not in a position to argue that, but it does raise the very important question of unfunded liabilities. We need go no further to find recent comment on this matter than the excellent report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation chaired by Labor Senator Nick Sherry. On page 24 of the third report of that Committee, some statistics are drawn together from across Australia on the liabilities accruing in the various Commonwealth and State superannuation schemes. It is important to know the definition of an unfunded liability&mdash;and that is provided in paragraph 74 of that report. It is basically where pension payments pledged by government to retirees are made from current revenue and where no fund exists to fund those future liabilities as they fall due. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of the problem accruing in Australia is becoming quite alarming. At this stage, the Commonwealth unfunded superannuation liability is in the realm of $33 billion; in Victoria, around $18 billion; in New South Wales, $14 billion; in Queensland, $3 billion; in Tasmania, $1.8 billion; in Western Australia, nearly $4 billion; in South Australia, nearly $3 billion; and in the Northern Territory, $0.4 billion. Across Australia, the size of this unfunded liability problem is now in the realm of $88 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the Senate that, if action is not taken to address the problem of unfunded liabilities at State, local and Federal government levels, there will be a big price to pay in future generations. It is always very easy for governments to come to terms with their current year financial considerations and keep putting off these problems year after year but, as we all know, if we keep doing that, sooner or later a crisis develops. There is very good evidence across the world now that, if governments do not come to terms with these unfunded superannuation liabilities, a crisis point will be reached. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation found that the crunch will come in Australia a lot sooner than most of us would like to think. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the Commonwealth Public Service, the current cost percentage&mdash;that is, employer financed costs of superannuation as a percentage of salaries&mdash;in the year 1984-85 was 12.5 per cent; in 1987-88, it was 16.9 per cent. By the year 2010, that is expected to rise to about 18.9 per cent to 19 per cent of salary. So the cost is getting quite enormous and quite out of hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The experience internationally is quite similar. Only a few countries have actually taken remedial action on this unfunded superannuation liability question. I think Great Britain and Denmark are the two best examples, but France, Italy, most of the European countries, and even Japan, have a rapidly rising problem. Indeed, there was a White Paper tabled in France recently which showed that contributions to its state pensions would rise from the current 19 per cent of payroll to between 31 per cent and 42 per cent by the year 2040. If payroll contributions to superannuation increase to between 31 per cent and 42 per cent within 40 years, then it is an enormous problem which needs to be addressed now; the problem certainly needs to be addressed in Australia before it gets much bigger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point worth noting is that, when international ratings agencies and financiers start to focus on the unfunded liability question, they would be sensible to take those into account when they are determining the risk associated with lending to the Government or the private sector. When that focus begins to take place, it will place pressure on interest rates and the rate on sovereign debt. So Australia's current $88 billion problem, which is rising rapidly at the moment, will become an enormous problem as the baby boomers begin to retire in the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The international experience was very well pointed out by Mr Brian Russell, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Steering Committee on Local Government Superannuation, who addressed a conference in Canberra a couple of months ago. One of his more interesting statements, which I will share with honourable senators, was that if we do not face up to the problem of unfunded superannuation liabilities and just continue with pay as you go&mdash;that is, funding people's superannuation payments by taxing the young to pay the old&mdash;we will be faced with a major problem. Mr Russell, whom I had the pleasure of meeting while he was in Australia, said to the conference in Canberra:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If countries fail to learn from them,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the funded schemes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">they will find themselves staring down into a yawning, unfunded, abyss with mounting debts and an over-burdened work-force, which has diminished at the worst possible moment.</PARA>
<PARA>There are a number of remedial actions that can be taken. Because the unfunded superannuation liability question is a matter which will affect the lives of every single Australian as we move towards the year 2000, it is certainly something that requires a non-partisan approach. I hope that the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation&mdash;or some other committee that is set up to do so&mdash;will do more on this question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another action that could be taken is to investigate the usefulness and the appropriateness of setting up notional funds&mdash;that is, a fund that is designed in a notional way to fund those superannuation liabilities as they fall due. They are not proper funds; they do not actually include any investments. They are a book entry where the funding requirements into the future are assessed and a notional investment fund is established: it is an artificial arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do not have some thorough, well-considered assessment of the funds' requirements into the future&mdash;such as through a notional fund which could be regularly scrutinised by actuaries and auditors&mdash;then we will not know the size of the problem. It would then become a focus for public attention. The size of the problem would become more a day-to-day focus for the people and it would not then be so hard politically to convert that notional fund in steps into an actual fund&mdash;they may be small steps&mdash;to actually begin to fund those superannuation liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, if we do not face up to the funding of these superannuation liabilities as the baby boomers start to retire in the year 2000, then we will have an enormous problem which will make our current debt problems pale into insignificance. This is an appropriate time to raise this matter as this Bill extends the benefits to a new range of people and, according to the Government, no cost has been associated with these new provisions. The coalition will not oppose the Commonwealth Superannuation Schemes Amendment Bill 1992; we support this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Good! Splendid! What a good reaction straight away. I just refer to Mr Howard's document&mdash;I do not even remember its name. Was it called Future Directions, the Back to the Future document&mdash;the one that did not know how to spell `women' and devoted two column inches to child-care? That was the Liberal Party's document on women. I do not know, but I suspect that Senator Newman may have contributed to this within that Party. But the Liberal Party has finally found women to be something else besides barefoot, pregnant and in the kitchen&mdash;although that is to quote their National Party colleagues, and I have never heard any of them deny it. It has an interesting history. Someone in the Liberal Party who was interested in women's issues and rights might have despaired by now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember the debate in this place about the sex discrimination legislation, and it makes terribly entertaining reading, mainly because of the `beyond farce' contributions from many members of the Opposition, certainly in this place, and in the other place. I think `barefoot, pregnant and in the kitchen' probably was said by one of the Queensland members of the National Party as a contribution to that debate. In fact, it is nice to reflect on what happened with that legislation. Some people in the Liberal Party crossed the floor to support the Government on it, and what happened to them? If one were interested one could ring Ian Macphee and ask; or one could ask Kathryn Sullivan where her career went because she supported women&mdash;to name just two. The Opposition does not like the cause of women. Women had to be in their place&mdash;at home, domesticated, married, dutiful and submissive. It has taken a long time for the Opposition to recognise, firstly, that women who have votes are worthy of being taken notice of but, more importantly, and less cynically, that women also have rights. So I find it entertaining today to listen to Senator Newman telling us how she has just discovered women; she has been talking to them for the last year, she said&mdash;that is a breakthrough, I suppose. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government put sex discrimination legislation in place. It took a long time and it took a few things that really matter. Proposing and promoting anti-discrimination legislation requires a combination of special characteristics. It requires political will; it requires serious commitment to the issue. One needs to be prepared to stay in there for the long haul&mdash;and, if one is concerned, one could ring John Stuart Mill; he would have a story to tell and so would his wife. One needs to know that it takes commitment. All of those things characterise the Government's record on sex discrimination legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome to the chamber the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Gareth Evans&mdash;a strong proponent of sex discrimination legislation and the rights of women, and certainly one of the people who have joined this Government's fight to see that those anti-discrimination measures were put in place. It is this Government that has put anti-discrimination legislation on the statute books, and it is this Government that is known and acknowledged for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women of Australia recognise their rights. This is no longer the 1970s or 1980s. Ten years of Labor government has changed a lot of things in this country, particularly the perception women have of their own selves and how they are valued&mdash;and there is no going back on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this package of legislation, this Government has added some further amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act. The one in particular that I would like to briefly comment on is the changes to provisions on sexual harassment. I have heard, and I suspect in the further contributions in this place today we will hear again if one is minded to listen, some very strange claims about what will happen to the world if we introduce the sexual harassment changes that are proposed in this legislation. We are really only bringing the Commonwealth legislation into line with the legislation that has been in South Australia for a few years and the legislation which, as I understand it, is now in Queensland and the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is actually a continuation of what the sex discrimination legislation says. It says that one is worthy of respect. Essentially that is what anti-discrimination legislation is about. It says that this society and this country will not go on allowing harassment, particularly sexual harassment. That is what this Government says to the people of Australia. It says that women can expect under the law to have an opportunity to bring a complaint and seek redress, and for men it says, `Don't do it. It is not legal. It is now illegal to behave in those ways that might have been a distraction or something that people thought was okay some time ago'. Sexual harassment is not acceptable. Women will say that it has never been acceptable. They have never liked it and they are very interested that the law has finally caught up with their view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also interested to note&mdash;I find it curious to put it this way, but I think it is true&mdash;that the sex discrimination legislation and the sexual harassment amendments are not about protections for women, although of course the majority of people who have brought complaints have been women and the majority of people who are discriminated against in sex discrimination terms are women. It is certainly not the case that this legislation is specific to women. I suppose most of us would have noticed&mdash;certainly I did and I suspect other honourable senators would have&mdash;the complaint of harassment brought by a man against his employer not too long ago. The claim was that favours were sought and, in colloquial terms, the hard word was constantly being put upon him. That is the nature of sexual harassment. It is apparently a legitimate complaint if a man brings it. I think it is about time we recognised that it is a very legitimate complaint for women to not want, or to protest against, harassment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I particularly like about this legislation is that the definition of sexual harassment is no longer tied to detriment in employment. That has not brought the South Australian Government to its knees; it has not wrecked Queensland or the ACT. It is merely saying that if we are serious about anti-discrimination legislation, if we are serious about saying to women, more particularly, but also to men in our society, that they should feel free not to be attacked or harassed, then we will legislate for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very interesting challenge, and a question that is often asked, is: if one knows of discrimination&mdash;and I suppose a lot of us can recognise it&mdash;what does one do about it? That is the question that one is faced with. The minute one takes steps to remove discrimination one is open to the charge of a different sort of discrimination; that is, positive discrimination or discrimination in favour of. But I do not worry too much about the abuse that is hurled at me if I stand in support of anti-discrimination, whether it is anti-race discrimination, anti-sex discrimination or whatever sort of anti-discrimination, because I am of the sort that believes that, once it is recognised, steps should be taken to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole affirmative action program was to address the question of not dealing with discrimination by introducing a further discrimination. It took a long time for those of us who were concerned to work through that proposal to make sure we were not replacing one discrimination with another. It is the easiest and cheapest form of criticism of any changes to discrimination legislation. I do not find it persuasive. I believe that if one recognises discrimination, or harassment in this case, one must take steps to do something about it. As the community has seen what the legislation says, it has very quickly understood that it is a protective mechanism; it is an ensuring and a protection of rights. It is about saying to people in the society that they ought to know that those rights actually do mean that they can expect protection and that they can expect not to be discriminated against. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For women it has been a very long wait, but I can tell the Senate that for many women I know it is extraordinarily well valued. I particularly like the story of three young Aboriginal women, two of whom worked with the Public Service, who went into a bar in a hotel in South Australia some few years ago. They were in their early twenties and they asked for a drink. One of them actually used to go quite often after work with mates to drink in this hotel so she was particularly surprised when she was, with her colleagues, denied a drink in no uncertain terms. I think the man behind the bar probably was never more surprised than when those young women said, `You can't do that to us. We know the law. We know it protects our rights. We know how to complain about you. We know where to go. Do you want to reconsider whether we get our drink?'. I am sure they said it somewhat differently, but that is the sense of what was said. They did know that the law protected them, they did know what to do about it and they were confident and able to say what the law was on their behalf. I suppose it is probably the very best story I have about the benefits of anti-discrimination legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator has what is called a very selective memory. Would Senator Newman like to compare the number of women completing education to year 12 now with the number way back then? The general retention rate of school children in this country was around 36 or 37 per cent when we came into office and it is now around 70 per cent across the country. From the last statistics I heard, more than 50 per cent of those retained year 12 students were girls. In tertiary education, in excess of 50 per cent of students going into universities now are women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anybody who has actually trawled over the history of the last century in this country and knows the fight women have had to get access to tertiary education should find the achievements in the last 10 years for rights for women to enter university, for access and opportunity for them to get into universities and for TAFE training, a matter of the greatest joy. Here is another sort of right for women: the right to actually have an education&mdash;a right that was denied them by tory governments for centuries. It has been the battle of women to get those rights&mdash;the right to an education and the right to a tertiary education as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Newman was selective about another claim. She did not actually say that she will tell the women on the campaign trail that she knows that under Medicare they were relieved of the burden of worrying about whether they could pay when they went to the doctor or took their families to the doctor. But she has a special project: under Fightback, they will have to pay at least $5 per head each time they visit the doctor. And that is if they have taken $6 a week gap insurance&mdash;which would be $312 a year&mdash;on top of the $5 to cover them for the gap from 75 to 85 per cent of the rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a good little package. Why does Senator Newman not tell the women of Australia about that? Why does she not tell them that when they are sick and have to go to the doctor or have to take a sick family to the doctor she has a project called `whack'em with at least $5 every time'? She is shifting the cost of health to the benefit of the specialists, the private hospitals and the AMA, rather than the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Newman should tell the women of Australia that when they are sick they will have to pay more to see the doctor. She should also tell them that she is going to force them, encourage them or coerce them into buying private insurance so that the specialists' fees listed on the AMA schedule will be even more expensive. She should tell them that every time they want some meat or some clothes they will be hit with that whacko con vivo GST. I am sure that the women of Australia will be very pleased to know that when they go to the supermarket Senator Newman's 15 per cent GST will make everything cost at least 10 per cent more. That should win their hearts and minds. Why does she not tell the women of Australia that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable senator trawled through a very selective list. The women of Australia will be able to make their decision at the next election. They will be able to say that they were quietly winning under the awards and the Industrial Relations Commission.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I claim to have been misrepresented by Senator Crowley and I wish to make a personal explanation. It is very difficult to know quite where to begin because Senator Crowley has spent the entire time misrepresenting both my Party and me. I can now respond only on the basis of her misrepresentation of me. She suggested that I had only newly come to the issues of status of women and that my interest in women's issues was of very short duration. I point out that I first became aware of the problems that women face in our community back in 1961 when, as a Commonwealth public servant, I married and found that I could no longer be a permanent public servant, leading through to problems with obtaining finance without my husband's guarantee. Then practising under the Family Law Act, I saw many women in real difficulties because they had nowhere to go to escape an abusive husband.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose I was sensitised by all these issues, and in 1972 I joined the Women's Electoral Lobby to fight for more women in parliament and to make sure that the men in parliament were also sensitised to the needs of Australian women. Through the 1970s, I was the convener for laws and the status of women with the National Council of Women in Tasmania. I was a founding member of two women's refuges to protect women who needed refuge from domestic violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have debated issues of importance to women as well as issues relating to defence, education, veterans affairs, et cetera, in this Parliament over the 6 1/2 years I have been here. I undertook my consultations with women, which I referred to in my speech and which Senator Crowley referred to slightingly in her speech, as a shadow Minister as part of Dr Hewson's consultation process with the Australian people&mdash;the Australia 2000 process. This led to the establishment of Fightback. The words, aspirations, hopes, dreams and even the fears of Australians were incorporated in Fightback to make Australia a better place to live for all of us and for our children and grandchildren in the decade ahead. Those consultations with women's organisations led to my editing the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Women Speak</EMPHASIS>, which I referred to in my speech. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak on the package of Bills before us: the Sex Discrimination and other Legislation Amendment Bill 1992, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992, and the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Amendment Bill 1992. I listened with interest to Senator Crowley's cynical contribution, in which she said that she was proud of her Government's efforts in the area of sex discrimination and equal opportunity for all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to highlight some of the failures of the Government's efforts in these areas, particularly in the area of women's health, which is a favourite subject of Senator Crowley's. I am sorry that she is not in the chamber to hear this. I would also like to repeat the comments of Mr Michael Lavarch, when he talked about the Government's failure to tackle the problems with serious policy options. Mr Lavarch blamed the slow pace of reform on Ministers, claiming that, while many introduced women's programs with fanfare and publicity, they often lacked the commitment to follow their rhetoric through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to highlight the Government's failure to implement a lot of its important policies to help Australian women after 10 years of empty rhetoric. I would particularly like to outline its failure to provide adequate health care and services to Australia's rural women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Health issues are clearly of major importance to women because they are the major users of the health system&mdash;not only for the usual illnesses and traumas, but also for services and illnesses that are particular to women. The Government has made many promises to improve women's health services. It has even put aside large sums of money to back its promises, but in many cases the money simply has not been spent and the promises have been broken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has failed women in four specific areas in health. Firstly, osteoporosis costs the health budget between $200m and $500m each year. Yet the Government has failed to provide Medicare benefits for bone density measurement&mdash;a simple preventative measure which could save the Government millions and millions of dollars. The second area is contraception. There have been no new contraceptive pills made available in Australia since 1981. The third area is breast cancer. This Government failed to live up to a March 1990 election promise to spend $64m over three years on the national program for early detection of breast cancer. In total, the allocation, including this year's estimate, is only $33.6m. The fourth area is the Government's failure to fund adequately specific women's health programs. In fact, five women's health programs suffered a drop in funding in 1991-92. These five programs, as contained in Appropriation Bills Nos 1 and 2 of 1991-92, show a total shortfall in funding of over $4.5m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this is bad enough in itself, but spare a thought for some rural women who in the 1990s are supposed to receive not only the same treatment as men but also the same treatment as their city sisters. They have always suffered from abysmal health care. Rural people are actively discriminated against and are candidates for rural poverty, yet the services they need access to have been taken away from them. If for no other reason, rural women need ready access to doctors and health services simply because of the enormous stress they are under. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this comes on top of an increasing workload for rural women. They have always worked full time on farms. They have done things such as bookkeeping, farm work and domestic work, as well as bringing up children and looking after aged relatives. The rural decline has added to this work because women are now taking the place of hired workers whose wages many primary producers can no longer afford. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same factors are stopping rural women taking part in social activities. A community nurse in a town in north-east Victoria contacted by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Healthsharing Women</EMPHASIS> journal in 1991 said that the people in the district were not visiting each other or attending social functions as much because of the cost of petrol. She described it as a `social health consequence of the economic downturn'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet despite all this, the Government has been exceptionally slow in providing rural counsellors; and those counsellors that do exist simply cannot cope with the existing workload. A 1989 study has shown that of the 72 types of social and community services available, less than half are available in rural areas. The most marked differences in services available in rural and non-rural areas occurs in the areas of counselling, medical specialists, alcohol rehabilitation and disability and women's services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Private, public and bush nursing hospitals across rural Australia have been downgraded and closed. Local GPs have packed up shop and moved to larger cities and regional centres. As a result, rural areas have significantly higher `population to general practitioner' ratios than urban areas. In the city it is one GP per 156 people; in the country it is one GP per 434 people. In addition, child-care facilities are not available, the high cost of petrol makes trips to see a doctor very expensive and there is no adequate public transport. Many rural families now cannot afford private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we combine all of these things, there can sometimes be unfortunate or tragic results. One example, quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Healthsharing Women</EMPHASIS> article on `Women, Health and the Rural Decline', is of a Victorian woman with an 8-month old epileptic baby. The woman wanted to know where the nearest support group was. When she found out it was two hours' drive away, she said she could not go&mdash;she simply could not afford the petrol costs. What happened to this woman and her epileptic baby? Has she got the information and the support that she needs? Is she coping well or is she not coping at all?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the Labor Government's rhetoric on human rights, equal opportunity, sex discrimination and affirmative action when it comes to health services for women in rural and remote areas? I do not know where it is. But what I can tell the Senate is that the first thing we need to do is get the wealthy off our public hospital queues by encouraging more Australians to take out private health insurance. In 1992 only 44 per cent of Australians were privately insured. In fact, between 20 and 25 per cent of Australians earning more than $50,000 do not have private health insurance and take their places alongside the poor and the elderly in our public hospital queues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's plan to improve health services, and health services to rural women in particular, includes improving access to health services, especially with mobile units providing mammography and bone density testing in rural areas. It also includes providing health insurance subsidies for those on incomes up to $30,000, and those aged over 65 at various rates depending on incomes. This will be of great benefit to rural women, particularly those living on farms, because farm losses will currently ensure that they are entitled to the maximum subsidy. The coalition's plan also includes retaining Medicare for the genuinely needy; increasing the remote area allowance and zone rebates by at least 25 per cent to ease the disadvantages experienced by women in remote areas of Australia; and reducing petrol costs, which will reduce the cost of travelling distances to hospital and specialist medical care services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will ensure that women of all ages, and from a variety of backgrounds, whether living in the city or the country, will have ready access to general and specialist health services. In the 1990s it is simply not good enough that women die and suffer from easily preventable illnesses and traumas. The coalition will not shirk from the responsibility to bring Australia's health policy for women into the 1990s. Fightback provides the means to bring about a fundamental change to our health policy for all Australians; and we will fight to bring Australia the fair, equitable and quality health service it deserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in the context of the Commonwealth Superannuation Schemes Amendment Bill 1992, I would like to make a brief comment on women gaining access to superannuation. Under this Government's policy, people who are outside the paid work force are discriminated against when it comes to providing for retirement because they are unable to contribute to a superannuation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, people who work only part-time or casually are unable to provide adequately for their retirement. This is because the Government has based its assumptions on a full-time worker earning an average of $30,000 a year over 40 years, who can then generate around 40 per cent of average weekly earnings in retirement compared with the age pension which equates to only 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. But, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, only 30 per cent of the 5.3 million workers in 1989-90 were women. In addition, 25 per cent of our work force is part-time or casual, and 75 per cent of these people are women. Also, 50 per cent of taxpayers earn less than $20,700. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government's scheme is a narrow occupational based scheme and therefore affects a disproportionate amount of women who will be unable to provide for their retirement. By contrast, the coalition's policy extends superannuation to spouses and partners, which will make a dramatic difference to women, both in and out of the paid work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the means by which superannuation will be extended to women is by allowing universal rebates of 25 per cent on contributions up to $6,000 a year for individuals and $12,000 a year for couples. The coalition estimates that superannuation will be extended to two million women outside the paid work force. For the first time, men and women who do not work or who are in part time or casual employment or with broken work records will have access to security in retirement. That is what equal opportunity is all about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the Bills before us, the Affirmative Action (Equal Opportunity Employment for Women) Amendment Bill 1992, is to amend the Affirmative Action Act. One of the purposes of the Bill is to extend the application of the Act to voluntary bodies which employ more than 100 people and also to unions and to group training schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also establishes the Affirmative Action Agency as a statutory body and gives it discretionary power to waive the current reporting requirements under the Act. In its current form the Affirmative Action Agency has been a great success. But now is the time to recognise that, if we as a community are serious about the principles of affirmative action, then the agency needs to be independent of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and to become a statutory body in its own right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principles of equal employment opportunity and affirmative action need a strong body not only to monitor their implementation but also to spread their application even further. In 1991, 83 per cent of respondents to a workplace attitudes survey felt that affirmative action for women was necessary but an almost equal number felt that the majority of employers paid only lip-service to the program and were not moving beyond the bare minimum requirements of the legislation.The recent review of the agency indicated that the status of the agency, as an appendage of an appendage within a government department, was an inhibiting factor in the progress towards true integration of the principles of affirmative action into workplace reform strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present the agency is forced to operate in a volatile political environment with a fluctuating level of commitment. At present it is constantly having to prove the value of the affirmative action legislation while being hamstrung by a lack of status and resources. The need for affirmative action strategies which go further is becoming greater with the advent of enterprise bargaining in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women now make up 42 per cent of the paid work force and the majority of the unpaid or volunteer work force. Forty-five per cent of women with children under the age of five are also in paid work. But there is still a significant amount of gender segmentation, with women clustered in a small range of occupations with limited advancement opportunities and reduced pay scales. I note that the Government is bringing on a package of reforms to the Sex Discrimination Act at this time which will attempt to address some of these inequities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on for some time listing the obstacles which women face, including the fact that at the closing end of this century, which has seen so many changes in the workplace, women still do not actually receive equal pay for equal work and have less access to award rates, bonuses and overtime. That is the difference between the rhetoric and the application. An affirmative action program with a strong agency to enforce and encourage its implementation is necessary to change the model of the family and the woman worker which now still holds back workplace reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to use enterprise bargain agreements to their fullest potential, we need to ensure that they are made with the principles of EEO in mind. An ideal enterprise bargain could well include flexible working hours; pro-rata award benefits; work related child-care, something in which I have had a particular personal interest in for some time; and it could also establish workplace environments which are non-discriminatory and not ruled by prejudicial behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With scarce resources, the focus of the agency has been on reporting and compliance of existing requirements, rather than actively pursuing its strategic policy objectives. The amendments give the agency the discretion to waive reporting requirements under the Act and to concentrate its resources on achieving what should be its unanimously supported vision of increasing the acceptance, understanding, implementation and extension of the principles of EEO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agency has a hitherto undeveloped role to play as an educational and advisory body as well as a policing body. In my interpretation, this Act enshrines the principle that there should be one rule for all, in that unions and voluntary bodies of considerable size must also comply. It also acknowledges that, despite the achievements of the agency so far, there is still much work to be done. The Democrats will be supporting this package. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a qualitatively different objection to the proposed sexual harassment amendments to the HREOC Act. These amendments propose that anyone who claims to have been offended, humiliated or intimidated by alleged sexist remarks will be able to complain to the Sex Discrimination Commissioner. If conciliation fails, HREOC would be able to award substantial damages against the respondent&mdash;damages which would be legally enforceable unless overturned in the Federal Court. This, of course, would require the respondent to have enough money to take the matter to court. Not many people have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previously, or more accurately, under the existing provisions, a complainant is required to demonstrate disadvantage before receiving damages, and awards are not legally enforceable unless the complainant secures an order of the Federal Court. Legal onus of proof, therefore, under the proposed conditions is thus transferred from the prosecution to the accused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, the concepts of offence, humiliation and intimidation are entirely subjective. How would anyone prove&mdash;even in a real court&mdash;that a complainant was not offended, humiliated or intimidated? How much harder would it be to prove in a kangaroo court in which evidence is not necessarily sworn and proceedings are not necessarily conducted in public?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any system which provides an opportunity for an individual to receive monetary damages obviously offers an incentive for exaggeration, if not the outright falsification of evidence. In a real court, or other procedures in which sworn statements are mandatory, the risk of perjury charges is a major deterrent to that sort of behaviour. But if these amendments are passed that deterrent will be watered down to the point of insignificance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments have been incestuously conceived by a group of activists citing and recycling each other's reports and opinions in a round robin process.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I speak on these Bills, I would like to respond to some of the comments made by Senator Crowley earlier in this debate, in particular her gratuitous insults of the Liberal Party in general and Senator Newman in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Senator Crowley said about the Liberal Party's attitude to women was just a clear nonsense. She said that the Liberal Party took the attitude that women should be barefoot and in the kitchen. Obviously anyone who says that has not met up with the luminaries in the Liberal Party, in particular Senator Bishop in this chamber and, in the New South Wales Parliament, the Hon. Marlene Goldsmith, the Hon. Virginia Chadwick and the Hon. Helen Sham-Ho. These are people who have, over the last few years, shown that they can make a tremendous contribution to the cause of women in the Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley is probably also totally unaware what an affirmative action party the Liberal Party was as far back as 1940. When the Party was established it set up in its constitution the provision that women should take particular places. For example, in New South Wales two of the four vice presidents must be women. In the State Executive, of the 12 country and city representatives, at least four must be women. If men achieve a higher vote than women, as I did on one occasion, they get passed over because there is a requirement that at least four women must be in these positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously Senator Crowley, in terms of her Liberal Party history, has no idea of the fact that this has been an affirmative action party for many years. I would like to compare our record, and the special position these women hold, with that of the Labor Party and its treatment of women within its party ranks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought Senator Crowley's comments on Senator Newman were absolutely disgraceful. Senator Newman pointed out her very long and distinguished track record on women's issues within this Party, which goes back to 1970 when she joined WEL. She has been a very keen advocate for women's causes and has shifted party policy in the direction that assists women. So to say that Senator Newman has had an interest in this area only over the last year is an absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Newman pointed out, in the production of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia 2000</EMPHASIS> document, which I will further allude to later in my speech, she was responsible for producing <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian women speak</EMPHASIS>, which targets the particular aspects of Liberal Party policy as it affects women. She has a very distinguished record in this area. It certainly does Senator Crowley no credit to take such liberties with the truth in relation to the Liberal Party in general and Senator Newman in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to these specific Bills that we are considering today in the Senate. In looking through this legislation I find it truly disappointing that the Federal Government has really failed to implement some very important policies which affect Australian women. I believe this stands in very stark contrast with the policies of the coalition which have been developed with women's issues particularly in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to point to the impact this policy will have on women in the education area. I am well aware that over the last 10 years this Labor Government has severely damaged the education sector. This impacts quite dramatically on women and on their chances for an education, work and a decent future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we turn to the various sectors of education, we see that in post-secondary education over 50,000 school leavers, over 50 per cent of whom are female, are denied access to higher education. The Labor Government has neglected the area of further education and vocational training by turning away up to 140,000 people each year, again more than half being women. After 10 years of allowing the sector to languish, this Government has finally been prodded into reforming the technical and further education area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More specifically, the Government has failed migrant women in Australia with cuts in the adult migrant education program. The Federal Government has shown a very blatant disregard for child-care, which is often so critical for women participating in education. These areas of education are absolutely critical to Australian women trying to regain access to the work force. After 10 years in office, this Government should be condemned by its record across the various sectors of education that I have alluded to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The views of Australian women were very well considered by the coalition parties during the formulation of the Fightback program. One of the seminal documents in terms of forming this policy was a program that we ran across Australia called Australia 2000. This was a political, grassroots consultation program that gave many people their first chance to express their opinions and to become actively involved in the design of their country's future. The findings were printed in a document called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia 2000</EMPHASIS>, and a subsequent report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian women speak</EMPHASIS>, specifically targeted the findings to the needs of women. This report was mentioned by Senator Newman earlier in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Australia 2000 program the importance of education in enhancing the self-esteem of Australian women was constantly emphasised. The encouragement of women to engage in education was seen as crucial to their future career opportunities. But the need for equal opportunity in the workplace for those who look for career advancement remains unchanged. To women in the paid work force who at the same time are trying to maintain the responsibilities of a family, issues such as child-care are absolutely critical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is something of which I personally have a lot of knowledge from my own family situation. My wife of 25 years and I have six children. Throughout our marriage my wife has been a full time home-maker, a part time employee and a full time employee. We are very aware of the issues concerning women who try to move in and out of the work force in response to changing family economic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having experienced this through the seventies and eighties, and now into the nineties, I can assure the Senate that it is extremely difficult for women. A lot more government focus is needed on the whole crucial issue of child-care. It was frequently stated during the Australia 2000 program that the provision of quality child-care on an affordable basis&mdash;including long day care, occasional care, after school hours care and holiday care&mdash;was imperative for women undertaking careers outside the home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This comes into particular focus with the Christmas holidays approaching. There are situations in many homes in this country where both husband and wife work and where children have to be cared for over a very long period of time. Society has not responded very well to this need, and in many cases we have the situation where there is no supervision at all for children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the coalition policy we have put aside funding of up to $90m for this area of child-care over and above what the Government is currently proposing to spend. It came home to many of us last year, when we were conducting the adult and community education hearings in the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, that this was the crucial issue for women. As we moved around Australia, we realised that there were many women who, through no fault of their own, had missed out on education and needed to catch up. Many of these women had been out of the work force for many years because they were in a full time child-care role and they wanted to come back into the work force. Yet they were often blocked, not only because there was inadequate access to courses but also because there was inadequate access to proper child-care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our Fightback policies we have addressed the question of additional funding for child-care and also the question of additional funding for education. In the Fightback document, the area that does best in terms of additional funding is education. This is of great benefit to women. We will spend another $945m over the next triennium on the expansion of vocational education and training, providing over 220,000 new training places. This funding commitment is an increase of $225m over the Keating Government's recent TAFE allocation increase. This massive injection of new funds into TAFE, plus the extra funding for places in tertiary education, will give women a wider range of better quality education and training opportunities. With these new skills, women will achieve the important first step towards re-entering the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our commitment to women does not just show through education policies. Equity considerations are built into all aspects of the Fightback policy, which is truly the most comprehensive and all embracing policy package presented by any political party in Australian history. The policies for women in Fightback are many and wide reaching. Under Fightback, the creation of two million new jobs by the end of the decade will provide unemployed women, women who are discouraged job seekers and women with a marginal attachment to the work force with either full time or part time employment and will ensure that these women no longer remain vulnerable members of our society. Increased funding for child-care support under Fightback by $90m will help women  who have found that the high cost of child-care fees has precluded them from the paid work force in the past to get jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A suitable system of family support has also been provided under Fightback. Family allowances will be doubled, which means an extra $1,500 per year for a three-child family. The dependent spouse rebate will also be increased by $300. We will introduce a $1,500 superannuation rebate for a non-working spouse, and an additional 320,000 families will pay no personal income tax because we will be lifting the minimum tax threshold. These policies, combined with the coalition's encouragement for employerassisted child-care, will provide women in the paid work force with greater access to child-care and give women in unpaid work better access to occasional child-care facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Fightback women will also benefit through our policies regarding industrial relations and superannuation, and there are benefits for older women, Aboriginal women, migrant women, career women, and women in rural towns and small business. Time precludes me from going through all the specific ways in which women will benefit from those policies. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I support the legislation for its equal opportunity provisions and other measures to correct the imbalance against women in our society, I recommend that, for women to benefit more fully in our society, the Government needs to adopt the complete policies of the Fightback package. After the next election I am sure that they will have the opportunity to do this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the time available to me is brief. Other than for the fact that I had the dubious distinction of hearing Senator Crowley, I probably would not bother to rise. I make but one simple point. I believe that there is an absolute gulf of difference between anti-discrimination and affirmative action. Affirmative action, by its very nature, is discrimination by one group in society against another group and inevitably at the expense of that other group. Employment based on sex or gender is discriminatory by its nature. It is reasonably argued by the more balanced, sensible women in the community that in the past there has been discrimination against women on the basis of their sex and that very often their talents and abilities have been overlooked. Senator Crowley and others in the Labor Party obviously actively support the proposed quotas, which will have the effect of discriminating against people in society on the basis of sex or gender, and prevent them from realising their full potential.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two other aspects. If we allow appointments to be made on the basis of gender and not on ability, it reflects poorly upon those people who have, by dint of their natural ability and talent, been promoted because they fall within the general category of people who have been promoted on a basis other than ability, and it detracts from their natural talent. A problem for American negroes is that they have become the lost class in middle management; because of the quota system, negroes have been promoted to a category and then shuffled sideways. They have simply been put there to fulfil the social engineering aspirations of a section of the community. We have human rights and equal opportunity legislation which ought properly to accommodate areas where there is discrimination against women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me, on the statistics that I have looked at, that between 1976 and 1983, when the coalition was in government, there was a fall in the percentage of women in employment positions which have been their traditional role. Since 1986 to 1992 there has been a rise. So the Affirmative Action Agency does not appear to have had any marked statistical effect upon the occupations and the roles which women fill in society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make one or two points in the general debate and some on the specific Bills: the Sex Discrimination and other Legislation Amendment Bill 1992, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 and the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Amendment Bill 1992. I was disappointed that Senator Crichton-Browne, in his remarks just now, chose to raise the old bogey of quotas in the context of the affirmative action legislation which is being amended here today, and amended to advantage. In my view that argument is a furphy. It always has been a furphy in the context of this Government's affirmative action legislation, legislation which I have always supported. I have supported its being strengthened along the way, as it is being strengthened again today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a furphy that is also raised in the Opposition's second reading amendment&mdash;but more gently than Senator Crichton-Browne raised it&mdash;which I viewed as perhaps a last gasp, a final go at raising that old bogey, which in past years has been insisted on very strongly by the Opposition. I am sorry that it has raised its head again. I thought the Opposition had realised by now that affirmative action legislation is just that. It does not interfere with employment or advancement on the basis of merit; it simply seeks to ensure that that merit is seen, is acknowledged and is then able to be acted upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also raise my voice in opposition to the coalition's policy to abolish the Affirmative Action Agency and disperse it throughout a range of other agencies and departments. I believe that equates to dispersal of the impact of the Affirmative Action Agency&mdash;an impact which I think has been clear over the years and will be improved by the amendments before us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted the lack of a definite proposition in Senator Hill's contribution as to what would happen with the role of the Affirmative Action Agency. I welcome the moves to cement the independence of the agency represented in this package because I believe that may, as is the Government's intention, retard that intention of the Opposition should it come to government after the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the present context, and in the possible context of a change of government, I believe that Liberal and National industrial relations policies, as implemented in my home State of Victoria&mdash;with the prospect of implementation federally&mdash;are harmful to women. The removal of overtime and penalty rates from awards, or their being tossed into a basket for negotiation, is of particular concern and disadvantage to women. I have my own reservations about the enterprise bargaining system put in place by the Government in that same context. Because of the constraints of time, I will not go into this matter in detail; I simply want to put it on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many times in debate on these Bills, contributors&mdash;when speaking on these Bills and on general issues of equal opportunity and sex discrimination&mdash;have referred to the proposition that legislation is important in moving our society in enlightened directions in these areas but that legislation is not the complete answer. I thoroughly agree with that proposition. We cannot necessarily legislate to change public attitudes. Nevertheless, as legislators we have a responsibility to play our part in shifting community attitudes and responding, in our responsibility to changing laws, to attitudes in the community which are already changing ahead of the legislation and ahead of the laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see that measures taken in a bureaucratic sense towards affirmative action do not always work to improve the role and opportunities of women. Perhaps the best example of that was brought to our attention through Senator Tierney's contribution to this debate in which he pointed out the many provisions that exist in the Liberal Party's arrangements to advantage women. Yet the role of women in the Liberal Party, particularly in past times&mdash;with the possible exception of those in this chamber&mdash;has not been a strong one when it comes to the elected and decision making positions. We know that legislation, bureaucracy and those sorts of processes do not always work, and it is important that community attitudes are moved by other means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very good to see the debate on women's issues and policies for women that is so much a part of this election campaign, which we seem to have been engaged in for many months already. This debate has been noted, and participated in, by members of the press. I think it is useful in advancing the interests of women. Women, by their voting patterns, have given increased significance to the issues that they want addressed. As former Senator Susan Ryan has said, the women's vote is now volatile and hard to win. That is why the respective contenders for government, some of whom we have heard in this chamber today, are engaged in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this debate&mdash;as noted in a major article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> by Margo Kingston&mdash;it appears that the Liberal Party is trying to persuade women that the Labor Party's approach to women's policies is tired and that women are no longer victims needing protection. The Liberals are changing their approach as well. Something has been said about this matter in the chamber already this morning. Margo Kingston contended in her article that the Liberals now say, in a switch of rhetoric, that women are the same as men. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Treating women as women almost by definition implies that women are different. Treating women as people means that women and men by definition start on equal footing.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, that is not so, even though it is probably the basis for the approach that the coalition is taking. We do not have to go very far to see that men and women are not equal or even that they do not start on an equal footing. That is why I am concerned, in relation to industrial relations processes&mdash;whether they be coalition processes of individual contracts or Government processes of enterprise bargaining&mdash;that we should not take this approach or start from the mind set that women are equal or start from the same position. Some are, but too many are not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable senators flick through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS> report, which forms the basis for most of the amendments in this package of Bills, as I did in my office a few minutes ago, they will find information on issues such as women in the paid work force who have family responsibilities. On page 30 of that report, Helen L'Orange, First Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, when speaking at a women and employment seminar, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, many employers still take the view that women employees have the primary responsibility for finding solutions to family problems. There is little recognition of the fact that these problems result often from a work environment designed around a family structure which consists of dad going to work and mum staying at home full time with dependent kids.</PARA>
<PARA>There is any amount of statistics, many of them in this report, that indicate that gender segregation in the work force still exists. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS> report there is a great deal of evidence of the position of women in academia being far from equal. For example, there is an under-representation of women in senior academic positions, a low representation of women on academic staff and a clustering in junior academic positions. Page 59 of the report refers to the Public Service. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If women and men with the same qualifications and length of service had reached the same levels, there would be about 60 per cent more women in the ASO6 to 8 level and almost twice as many in the Senior Executive Service as at June 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>On page 163, referring to women in politics, Maxine McKew, the ABC's senior political journalist, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The dominant ethic in politics is still overwhelmingly male. Women have undoubtedly influenced the agenda, but they have not yet managed to change the rules of the game.</PARA>
<PARA>Attitudinal change is important. In spite of all the legislation&mdash;and I acknowledge the amount of legislation regarding equal opportunity and anti-discrimination that has been passed in the last decade in this place and which is improved on in this package of Bills&mdash;community attitudes remain a problem. Since in this debate a good deal of emphasis is put on the fact that there is an ongoing responsibility for women, which many women choose, of full time home making for at least part of their life&mdash;in my case, for 20 years of my life&mdash;I think it is to that area that we can and must look. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> in June of this year, Bettina Arndt made some very important comments on that issue. I commend that article to my colleagues. She drew together a great deal of research, all of which makes the same point: in spite of legislation and in spite of rhetoric, the burden still falls most heavily on women within the home&mdash;and, of course, it becomes the double burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This conflict in attitudes is vested on children, and this is borne out by Sydney sociologist Hugh Mackay. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Boys are confused by the messages their mothers are giving them and the contradictory role model their fathers are providing. </PARA>
<PARA>We need to look at the approaches that are taken in legislation that has already been passed and in amendments that we are passing here today to see whether, in each of our lives and in the lives of our community generally, we are really moving in directions which confirm the sorts of changes which we are trying to implement. We have a responsibility to legislate for these changes, but as individuals we should also see whether we are playing our own roles, as we should, in the attitudinal change of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of observation is referred to in the Bettina Arndt article. She explains that when mothers pick up their children from school, the boys automatically hand their school bags to their mother. In the handing and the receiving of the school bag there is a quite strong social statement. That might seem to be a small thing, but it equates with picking up dirty socks and a range of other things which we need to think twice about before we do. I do express a word of sympathy for women described in the Bettina Arndt article as having a double burden. Despite their good intentions it is often hard to summon the energy to fight the fight over school bags dropped in the hallway, unemptied dishwashers, unfed dogs, wet towels on the floor and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly support this legislation to the extent that it can make some changes that are necessary in the lives of men, women and children in the community. It goes far beyond legislation, which we all agree with; we all have a role to play, both as legislators and as individuals, in advancing the interests of all people for equal opportunity and non-discrimination in our society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are today debating a series of Bills. The first three Bills are the Sex Discrimination and other Legislation Amendment Bill, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Amendment Bill. Lumped with those Bills is the Commonwealth Superannuation Schemes Amendment Bill. Some honourable senators have spoken to that Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate on the first three Bills has been quite wide ranging and I refer to one aspect of it. In a debate of this kind it is inevitable that a number of issues will be brought up. The Liberal Party has been discussed by at least two senators on the other side of the chamber. They have substantially indicated their ignorance of Liberal Party policy and in particular their ignorance of the role that Senator Newman has played during her life with respect to the advancement of the cause of women. It is in addressing that matter that I will take a little time of the Senate. I think it is better that this be done now, rather than the matter being left on the record as it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tierney spoke briefly of the record of the Liberal Party and women. I shall not go through it all because it is on the public record in each of the six States of this country. The first women elected to any of those parliaments, starting with Edith Cowan in 1921, were from non-Labor parties such as the Nationalist Party and the United Australia Party, which was the predecessor of the Liberal Party. In each of the six States non-Labor women were the first women elected. This is also the case with Dame Enid Lyons in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go through the record of the Party in the Parliament and the organisation. It is my view that the strength of the organisation is very important indeed. It is there that women have played a very important role. Joy Mein used to be President of the Liberal Party in Victoria and other women have been presidents of divisions since that time. Women have played a prominent role in that respect. To suggest, as one Government senator has, that the Liberal Party had just discovered women flies in the face of the facts. One will find this if one takes the trouble to read the history of the Liberal Party, inquire about the way it is structured at an organisational level and find out about the opportunities that there are for women to a play a very meaningful part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in the area of policy initiatives that the record needs to set straight. Suggesting that we had only discovered women in the last year or so almost implied that nothing had ever been done previously. I will run through some of the issues of importance, starting with the Child Care Act of 1972 introduced by the McMahon Liberal Government. Family allowances were introduced in 1976-77, being paid directly to mothers in whose care the children were. That rate was raised in 1981-82 by 50 per cent for larger families and by that much in 1982-83 for the first and second children. The allowance was debased quite soon after the Hawke Government came to power because it did not increase those amounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Women's Advisory Council was established in 1977 following a national inquiry into the role of women. The Human Rights Commission was established by the Liberal Government and Dame Roma Mitchell was appointed its first chairman. The Office of the Status of Women was established after the establishment of the Office of Women's Affairs in 1976. The Women's Welfare Issues Consultative Committee was appointed in 1976 to advise the Social Security Minister on issues relating to the special welfare needs of women. The Office of Child Care was established within the Department of Social Security in 1976. I remind you, Mr Deputy President, though you would need no reminder of it, that Dame Margaret Guilfoyle was Minister for Social Security in those years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1976 the Superannuation Act gave equal treatment to female public servants in the area of superannuation&mdash;one of the areas dealt with in the Fightback package. There are many areas of Fightback which are of benefit to women, and they have been spelt out. Superannuation is one area where we stress that there is a need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor has made a number of changes to superannuation in recent years. Nobody could possibly have kept count of the number of changes that have been made. Never once has the Labor Party made a change which has recognised the right of women to have meaningful superannuation. Women have never been able to have a superannuation scheme which can be paid into whether they are in employment or not at any particular time. At no stage has this been recognised by the Labor Party. It has failed women badly in the area of meaningful superannuation and retirement income. To be doing that at a time when we know that the population is ageing and there will be larger numbers of women retiring as the years go by is criminal neglect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1980 the Liberal Government established the Institute of Family Studies. It was a Liberal Government that signed the United Nations Convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women and moved towards the process of ratification. The shopfront information services were established in the ACT in 1978 by the Office of Women's Affairs as collection points for women's ideas on government plans and policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party established the Women's Film Fund to support production of films for and about women. We extended rehabilitation services to housewives in 1978. We extended the eligibility for pension health benefits to single parents and dependants in 1979. We increased the child allowance for pensioners by 25 per cent in 1980. In 1983 we developed the family income supplement scheme to assist low income families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other matters that I could go on with; those  I have mentioned are some which should be placed on the record in this debate in view of the comments that senators on the other side have made.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Government I wish to thank those honourable senators who have contributed to the debate on what is an important package of Bills dealing with the status of persons in our Australian society.

I believe that this is an important further reinforcement of a cultural reform that has been undertaken for many years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge Senator Newman's point that when one looks at the history of the women's refuge movement, one will see many of the bases and foundations for a new attitude in Australian society to the status and plight of women in our society, whether one is looking at the particular issue of criminal violence in the home or household&mdash;sometimes euphemistically referred to as domestic violence&mdash;or in these wider matters of discrimination in regard to employment opportunities, education opportunities, the right to participate in a non-discriminatory superannuation scheme, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to Susan Ryan, a former Senator, who has already been mentioned in the debate. Many of us who were in the Senate chamber in the very early days of the Hawke Labor Government can recall endless weeks of debate. It was her fierce determination, her strong-willed perseverance and her particular role then with the basic statute&mdash;which was subject to a lot of misunderstanding and misrepresentation in the community, and perhaps even some of that crept into the chamber&mdash;which put that initial statutory framework into place. We have been building on it ever since, and this afternoon is no exception. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major elements of this Bill have already been well-rehearsed in the course of the debate. In regard to the Sex Discrimination Act, the Bill will focus on the question of sexual harassment. This is a situation where a person need not suffer any particular disadvantage as a result of the unwelcome sexual advances made by another person. The fact that he or she is subject to such advances and feels humiliated and offended by such unwelcome conduct will be sufficient to ground the processes provided for in the Act, provided that there is also an element of a check on the mere assertion by somebody of perhaps very sensitive or tender sensibility that they have been offended or humiliated by some course of action by the person about whose conduct they are complaining. It will be necessary for the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to conclude that a reasonable person, having regard to all the circumstances, would have anticipated that the complainant would be offended or humiliated by the course of action engaged in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is also very important to notice in this Bill&mdash;as will become clear in the committee stage&mdash;that we are providing a mechanism so that, when we move into this current phase, and even more strongly enterprise bargaining and certified agreements between employers and employees, there will be a mechanism which will allow a person to bring to the attention of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission an allegation that there is discrimination under the award, which will include certified agreements. If that is the case in the view of the Sexual Discrimination Commissioner, then the Commissioner must refer the award to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in most circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a hearing to review the award and the Industrial Relations Commission will, with the benefit of the Sexual Discrimination Commissioner appearing before it, determine whether there has been a discriminatory clause inserted into the award and, if so, take whatever action is necessary to remove the discrimination, unless it believes that that variation from the award or certified agreement would not be in the public interest. We believe that this is just a simple mechanism to permit that course of action to take place to reinforce the situation which, as I understand it, is pretty widespread in the workplace now under awards. A lot of what once might have been regarded as discriminatory provisions five or six years ago have been progressively eliminated, and one does not want to see them creeping back under the pressure of enterprise bargaining and the certified agreement process. They are perhaps the major matters within this Bill of a substantial nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the question of the way in which a determination by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission&mdash;the disability discrimination legislation is also relevant, not just the Sex Discrimination Act or the Racial Discrimination Act&mdash;might be enforced. At the moment a complainant who wishes to enforce a determination of the Commission must bring proceedings in the Federal Court. The Federal Court virtually has to start from scratch. This is at considerable expense to the complainant. It is proposed that a determination will be registered in the Federal Court. It will have effect as if it were an order of the court, unless the respondent to the determination applies to the court within 28 days for a review of the determination. In the absence of such an application, action can be taken through the usual processes of the court to enforce the determination. I believe this will greatly strengthen anti-discrimination laws within Australia, and that is to be welcomed as a mechanism to help achieve that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the package of Bills before us we also have the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Amendment Bill 1992. It seeks to further strengthen the status of the affirmative action provisions that are already in place and operating in the Australian community. The legal status of the authority, the Affirmative Action Agency, as a statutory body is achieved by means of this Bill.

Indeed, it is extremely pleasing to see that in relation to such voluntary bodies such as major education providers, including the Catholic schools system, over the signature of the Reverend T.M. Doyle, Director of Catholic Education in Victoria, there is a very clear indication that the Catholic schools system will be pleased to cooperate with the provisions of this Bill.

<PARA>One can see very considerable cultural and social changes occurring in Australia, which are there given support in an area which is sometimes wrongly stereotyped and caricatured as being hostile to this type of advance.

This is done either by not recognising them at all or by placing a qualifying period or dependency test on the de facto spouse, modified in a way which brings the Commonwealth schemes into line with the way in which the private schemes that we dealt with before will be required to operate from, I think, 25 June 1993. </PARA>

I remind the Minister that the figure of 160,000 is in fact taken from Labour Force Australia, October 1992, by the Australia Bureau of Statistics, so it is not our figure. The question I asked the Minister is: in view of the low growth rate, does he rule out a further rise in unemployment with school leavers coming on to the market? As there are 164,000 teenagers underemployed, does he rule out a further increase in that group also? Furthermore, in the light of these appalling figures, when is the Government going to address employment policies that will give these young people some hope?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 2 December last, the Prime Minister and I announced our intention to encode in Australian legislation the principles of the United Nations labour agency, the ILO, and its conventions on matters of minimum wage, equal pay, unfair dismissal and redundancy pay. We said that we would do this using the external affairs power of the Australian Constitution and that this would ensure that we were putting together a safety net, taking as our bible the International Labour Organisation and its declared international standards. Honourable senators will know that the World Health Organisation, for example, of the United Nations sets international health standards. The ILO sets world labour standards and they will be the standards that we will use.</PARA></TALK.START>

It did so to the extent that yesterday the head of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry criticised the Kennett amendments as being too hasty, containing too many errors and denying a number of reasonable possibilities, and asked for them to be stood aside. So the leading spokesperson from the employers was critical yesterday of the Kennett manoeuvre to rush industrial legislation.

In the Senate Estimates Committee B hearing last Friday, the Office of Local Government could not provide details of how many people had found jobs under this program because `it was not an employment program, we did not seek figures in relation to unemployed people'. However, the Treasurer states on page 79 of the Budget-related paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working for the Future</EMPHASIS> that the local capital works program `will focus on those local government areas which are experiencing higher than average rates of unemployment'.

So in the very example that the honourable senator has brought forward, I understand that there will be instances of day labourers receiving employment opportunities that otherwise they would not get.

I have made repeated representations through our Jakarta Embassy and here raising the Australian Government's concerns in connection with the detention of both Xanana and the others I have mentioned.

As the representative said in a radio interview this morning, the findings of the ICRC do remain confidential in accordance with its terms of operation in Indonesia and, indeed, in many other parts of the world. However, it can be said that Indonesian authorities, in allowing the ICRC to visit Xanana without witnesses, have complied with an important condition of access set by the organisation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The conclusion we could draw from the article by Adele Horin, a correspondent for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, is that the individual work contracts policy of the Kennett Government&mdash;the same policy that has been adopted by the Opposition federally&mdash;is anti-woman worker. It works against the interests of women workers because it does not provide protection from exploitation and it provides no regular safety net. To see this we need only look to what the Kennett Government did to nurses in Victoria when it unilaterally reduced their income per week by between 25 per cent and 30 per cent by virtue of the removal of weekend penalty rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article by Adele Horin says that many women in the clothing, food processing and retail industries lack bargaining power at the best of times&mdash;and when the economy is like this their lack of bargaining power is even more pronounced&mdash;and that that enables them to be exploited. It leads to their being put in a situation by unscrupulous employers in which they are required to sign whatever work contract is put to them or face dismissal from employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Ms Horin has said in her article is exactly right, in my view. It sets out the reasons why the Government will not introduce an industrial relations policy that is as unfair and as lacking in principle as the industrial relations policy of the Kennett Government and of the Federal Opposition. Among the observations that Ms Horin makes are that, under a system of individual employment contracts, many women will be forced to accept big cuts in their take home pay; that young women are particularly vulnerable and could be forced to work for only $3 an hour; and that women with children could also be forced to work 60 hours a week without overtime rates or penalty rates or to work 12-hour shifts on the weekend even though they have no time to mind their children. These observations constitute a number of reasons, on the grounds of fairness, why the Government will not act to produce an unfair effect on living standards of women workers in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise that women workers and others are vulnerable and need a safety net to protect them. That safety net is the institution of an Australian award as a product of a fair and independent industrial relations system. We believe that this system offers all the flexibilities necessary for employers, and there is enough evidence to demonstrate this. Yesterday I referred to two significant agreements which demonstrated workplace flexibility to the level that anyone could ever want. The flexibility that it does not provide is the flexibility to cut wages.</PARA>

That is an example of the ill-informed approach by the Opposition on this subject&mdash;or the misleading approach, if I am being generous by saying `ill-informed'&mdash;in talking down the very real benefits of waterfront reform to the economy. Independent research by the Prices Surveillance Authority under the chairmanship of Professor Allan Fels has shown that the savings to exporters and importers by greater efficiencies on the Australian waterfront were of the order of 25 per cent; a reduction in charges by the stevedoring companies of around 25 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth regards the title or status of Queens Counsel as anachronistic. It comes from a time when certain senior counsel would be available at first call to the Crown and, for a modest fee, would provide some advocacy service. That convention has long since died, and certainly the convention of a small fee for QCs died a long time ago, as I think Senator Cooney's committee looking into the cost of justice will have discovered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not believe that there is any need for the Governor in Council to add what is really a fictional gloss these days to the status of senior members of the Bar. No doubt, with the sense of theatre and deference to hierarchy which characterises the legal profession, some other substitute recognition will evolve within the profession, but without that imprimatur of a Governor in Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed that yesterday in Perth most State governments and Territories agreed to no longer appoint Queens Counsel, choosing instead to allow the legal profession to take over the process of appointing a more senior level of barristers. I understand that the Chief Justice of the Northern Territory very successfully argued that the appointment of QCs was an outmoded, archaic and anti-competitive practice which, he said, increased the cost of legal services. I believe that that matter is already well in hand in those jurisdictions where it is important. At the Commonwealth level, it is not a matter of great importance. I think only two QCs have been appointed by the Commonwealth, one being Dennis Rose; I forget the name of the other one. That is only two over the whole history of the Commonwealth.</PARA>

Then in response to my protestations across the chamber, he said, `Well, it may have been that those allegations were found to be false'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that those allegations were never made. Four years ago the Government introduced the licensing of migration agents to deal with business migration. It changed the whole way in which business migration applications were processed through the Department by licensing private agents to virtually approve them&mdash;a policy the Government has subsequently abandoned because it was proven to be quite inadequate and quite unsuitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that was raised at that time was whether a firm in which I and other partners had an interest was an appropriate firm to be granted one of those licences, having a member of parliament as a partner in that firm. There was never any suggestion made at that time, nor could it have been made, that that business was being operated from an electorate office. Other people were involved in the business. It was operated from completely separate premises. So the allegation that Senator Bolkus made across the chamber was false in the extreme. That ought to be understood and recognised. Of course, one can debate the other issue as to whether a member of parliament ought to be part of such a firm which is licensed by the Government. </PARA>

In terms of a policy matter, I am very glad that it has been abandoned because it was a very poor policy to have been introduced.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Point of order: The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Hill) raised a point of order to the effect that Senator Collins had provided an answer to the question rather than an explanation of failure to answer it, and therefore Senator Chamarette was not in order in moving to take note of an explanation.</PARA>
<PARA>Then under the heading `Ruling of Deputy President' the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Journals</EMPHASIS> state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Deputy President (Senator Colston) indicated that, having examined the information provided by Senator Collins, he concluded that it was not in the nature of an explanation of failure to answer the question, but was in the nature of an answer. Therefore he ruled that Senator Chamarette was technically not in order in moving to take note of an explanation, but could seek leave to make a statement.</PARA>

Mr Deputy President, whilst I recognise that you are, of course, being constructive, I do not think you are interpreting this provision correctly.

It seems to me that on a normal commonsense interpretation of this provision, if the answer is provided the opportunity for debate on the explanation for not providing it is overtaken.

I asked him again about another of the depressing statistics that are before us, namely, the number of young people&mdash;the 15- to 19-year-olds in this country&mdash;who are out of work. According to the figures of the Bureau of Statistics, at the moment in Australia 160,000 are looking for work and unable to get work. That is an enormous figure. And they are about to be joined, regrettably, by many thousands more school leavers who are finishing their secondary education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is only half the story because other research tells us that another 160,000 teenagers are part employed when they are seeking further employment. So this is the fact of underemployment on top of existing unemployment. In relation to young people in this country there are around 330,000 underemployed or unemployed with further numbers, regrettably, about to join them. This is happening because this Government's economic policies are not resulting in a growth level in our economy that is sufficient even to maintain the current level of employment. The Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, acknowledged that in an interview on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> when he was asked, `What hope is there for school leavers coming on the market with growth levels of 2 per cent?'. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not. It will not even maintain the current level of employment. Even the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, understands that. People are coming onto the employment market at a rate in excess of the growth in the economy. I would have thought even Senator McMullan could understand that. But he is typical of his Government: rather than face up to the responsibility and put an alternative program before the Australian people that can give hope to all young Australians who are suffering, he sits here and says that there is not a problem. That is the fundamental error before us: this Government does not acknowledge the problem, no matter how great it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem does not relate only to youth unemployment. Look at what we had last week. For the first time, foreign debt in this country is in excess of $200 billion gross. That is ten-fold what this Government inherited. Senator Button says that that is not really a problem. The current account is blowing out again: Australia is sucking in imports even though the growth level is so low. We are hardly out of a recession, yet we are again sucking in imports. For nine months the trend has been upwards. Last week we received the highest figure in the last three years, but this Government says that is not a problem. The growth figure indicates that the level of unemployed will not be absorbed and that there is no hope for the unemployed in what we are getting from this Government at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until the intervention of the Victorian issue, the best we have been able to get is that the Government will stand on its record. It offers Australia no plan at all. Its political strategy has been to simply attack the Opposition for its plan or talk about what is happening in Great Britain or any other irrelevant matter. It will not face up to the Australian people with a plan or a program that will demonstrate how it can bring the Australian economy out of the mess it created and how it will give people in this country some hope for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has created a mess. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) acknowledged when he was Treasurer, this was the recession we had to have. His strategy was to push interest rates up to try to dampen demand. However, the result was that he put good Australian businesses out of business; bankruptcies soared; many people went out of business forever; and people found they had no alternative but to import goods. More jobs went as a result. So this downward spiral continues. But this Government will not acknowledge it; this Government will not face up to it; and this Government will not put an alternative set of policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Independent commentators are starting to recognise that there is this policy vacuum and this failure on the part of the Government. I think it is worth quoting Ross Gittins, a respected economic commentator, who on 23 November said that Labor does not deserve to be re-elected, has nothing positive to offer and that since February Paul Keating has done `nothing but hope like hell the economy would recover in time for the election' and `as to what he'd do if he wins the election, his mind's a blank'. That is the future the Prime Minister offers for Australia: his mind is a blank. A day or two after that Terry McCrann, in somewhat dramatic terms, although I do not think he overstated it, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we have a Prime Minister determined to win the coming election, to win the coming election at any cost&mdash;and that cost is the future of Australia. With utter and almost clinical cynicism, he will do anything to court short-term popularity. Now we have a government ruthlessly feeding on our fears and uncertainties about the reforms we desperately need.</PARA>
<PARA>What a sad commentary about this Government. But how this Government deserves it. With the misery it has inflicted on so many Australians and its unwillingness to face up to its economic failure and to provide an alternative program, it certainly does not deserve re-election at the forthcoming election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact there is no agenda was confirmed by Peter Hartcher, who is the last of the three commentators I will mention, when in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 13 November&mdash;Peter Hartcher has good sources in the ALP; he snooped around looking for the Labor Party's fifth term agenda&mdash;he came up with:</PARA>

Out of that statement, we can see another aspect of the Prime Minister's approach to politics&mdash;that is, building up false expectations. No matter the harm that might be done, the Prime Minister always overstates his position in the hope of short term political gain. We saw it with the now infamous One Nation speech which is typical of Mr Keating's exaggeration. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor's plan for the next four years will create over 800,000 jobs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>since making that speech, unemployment has gone up by some 37,000&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">without increasing the current account deficit&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>last week we had the highest figure in three years&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and at the same time, return the budget to surplus and Australia to growth.</PARA>
<PARA>The Budget deficit is skyrocketing. That is the record of this Government. In February 1992 he had no sound basis at all for making that statement. But that would not worry him. A month later, in March, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As it starts to move, we push the extra stimulus of One Nation into it, which will then see the Government spending between about March and Christmas and June of next year which should push the economy along quite nicely back to growth, back to employment growth and back to lower levels of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to talk about the Government hitting its straps. The record since One Nation has been appalling&mdash;unemployment has gone up, the growth figures are depressed&mdash;and there is no hope coming from it at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did One Nation fail? It failed because it required the so-called special relationship between the ALP and the union movement to provide a recipe for growth, particularly in relation to the infrastructure developments and, in turn, in relation to railways. Despite that special relationship, the unions did not cooperate; so One Nation did not provide the jobs it was intended to. One Nation broke down. A month or so ago the Government had no alternative but to in effect abandon it. It had to take money out of the infrastructure projects and out of the job projects and put it into an attempt to gain short term political growth, mainly through local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lie in that has been demonstrated so aptly by some of my colleagues who have looked at what local governments are doing with this money. The program originated in the last Budget, but my colleagues have found that it is not producing new jobs at all. When the Treasury officers appeared before them in this Parliament earlier this week, the Treasury officers had no figures to indicate how this would produce growth, what jobs were to be created or where they were to be created. That is not surprising because it was not supposed to do that. This was another of Mr Keating's political tricks. That is all he is interested in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest of these political tricks is what is happening in Victoria. In Victoria, the incoming Premier and his Government inherited some $30 billion worth of debt and record unemployment&mdash;a disastrous legacy of 10 years of appalling government by Labor. The new Victorian Government has a mandate from the Victorian people to set it right, to make Victoria efficient again, to give it the opportunity to be competitive, to give businesses the opportunity to be competitive and, therefore, to provide long term, sustainable jobs. That was the mandate Mr Kennett was given. But was he allowed to get on and do that job? No, he was not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister saw here an opportunity to raise another political issue, another diversion, whilst at the same time showing respect for his Labor mates and their vested interests into which he is locked. We must not forget that when the Prime Minister did his deal with the former Prime Minister at Kirribilli House a few years ago, carving up the future job of Prime Minister of this country, who his second was. It was Mr Kelty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who do we know has had more influence than anyone outside this Parliament on the policies of this Government over the last 10 years? It is Mr Kelty&mdash;unelected. It is these people&mdash;Mr Kelty and Mr Halfpenny&mdash;from whom this Government requires support for its survival. So when they see their vested interests suffering under policies such as the Kennett policy of abolishing compulsory unionism, they call upon Mr Keating to respond and he calls upon the nation&mdash;in effect, he endorses it&mdash;to go out in mass industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He did it in the political way. When the unions, Halfpenny and others in Victoria called upon mass industrial action, Mr Keating and his Minister here said, `We understand why it ought to be done nationwide'. So their response was to call mass industrial action. When that started to become politically difficult, their second response was to legislate to interfere in the Victorian process of recovery by trying to provide an alternative method of industrial relations, a method of industrial relations which over the last 10 years has contributed to the economic disaster and the record level of unemployment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not good enough. It is not a government that is deserving of re-election. It is not a government that has a fifth term agenda. All it goes to the Australian people with is a record of failure, of hundreds of thousands of Australians who have unnecessarily suffered misery as a result of that failure. So, whatever this Government might say about Fightback, it is a program that can provide recovery to this country, that can provide the parameters for an efficient and competitive Australia, and that can give Australians the long term possibility of real, sustainable jobs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The contrast which this debate will display leaves no doubt why all the polls are showing big swings to Labor. The Morgan poll, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> poll, the Newspoll and Saulwick all indicate a minimum swing of about 3 per cent to the Government. Just to point out what that would mean to my colleagues, who I am sure are interested, any swing of that proportion would mean a gain to the Government of about 12 seats, or a majority of 30. I thought I would point that out just in case the Opposition has not understood what those four polls mean. The Australian people know&mdash;everybody knows&mdash;that the economy is growing too slowly. They do not need people to come up with policies to wreck it; that is not an alternative they want.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economy is growing too slowly, but the unpalatable fact to the Opposition is that it is growing better than any other country in the OECD. Consensus Economics, on 2 November, did a survey following the survey by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> in June, which I quoted and which said that in 1992 Australia will be the best and that in 1993 Australia will be the best. Consensus Economics now does a survey of most of the OECD countries and what does it say? It says that Australia will grow more quickly than the other countries listed, but not quickly enough. We should be doing better. It is not grounds for complacency, but it is doing better than any other Western economy. Compared with the United States, Japan and Germany&mdash;the three great engines of growth which are compared in this survey&mdash;Australia is expected to be faster in 1992 and faster in 1993; two per cent in calendar year 1992 and 3.8 per cent in calendar year 1993. That is the expectation of the international economic consensus, as surveyed by Consensus Economics, which publishes that report regularly. It is the same conclusion as that of the survey of economists conducted by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> in June. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not grounds to say that we should not be doing better and that we need not do more. But the signs of improvement are there. They are the sorts of mixed messages that we always get when the economy is in transition. We got them when the economy was in transition from growth, and slowing down. That is why the decision to reduce interest rates was taken too late&mdash;too late, we acknowledge, although when we first reduced interest rates, Dr Hewson said that we were doing it too early. Nevertheless, it was too late. That is the problem we have to cope with now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mixed messages now indicate that the economy is turning again. The ANZ job survey indicates that job advertisements are picking up. According to the last figures published in the Department of the Parliamentary Library's monthly economic and social indicators, it had picked up 4.7 per cent over the last 12 months. That has improved. Since then, the most recent figures show a further modest improvement. The most recent Westpac forecasts indicate that for 1993 the revised estimate for GDP growth in Australia is 3 per cent, with inflation at 2.7 per cent and unemployment still too high but falling. I might say that growth in Australia is higher than in New Zealand and unemployment in Australia is lower than in New Zealand. So if the Opposition still aspires to turn Australia into New Zealand, there is little in that data to recommend it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry survey released today&mdash;at least, I got the copy today; it is a November survey&mdash;indicates that its respondents, that is, businesses, expect an upturn in conditions within their own businesses and are expecting improvement to continue across the next half year. Production levels are expected to rise slightly, while investment is expected to be maintained&mdash;a positive investment result for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of that is to say that, therefore, everything in the garden is rosy. The 2.1 per cent growth in the economy over the last 12 months, notwithstanding that it is better than any other Western country, is not sufficient. We need to do more. The key to growth in this state of our economic cycle is demand. The thing which is mainly driving growth at the moment is government demand, arising from One Nation, the youth employment statement and the Budget. The worst thing one could contemplate doing is what Fightback suggests, which is to withdraw that one element driving growth at the moment&mdash;government demand. The only two public figures in the Western world suggesting that the appropriate economic strategy is to withdraw government stimulus are George Bush and Dr Hewson&mdash;nobody else. The Government of Japan is saying, `We should give massive economic stimulus because we are getting into a recession'. As a proportion of GDP, it would be a much more significant stimulus than Australia is giving because Japan's economic base is stronger from which to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UK is giving a very substantial stimulus, a much bigger percentage of GDP than is the case with Australia. President-elect Clinton has just been elected on a strategy of doing exactly the same in the United States. Every other country in the Western world is suggesting that the appropriate thing for government to do at this stage in the economic cycle is to give a stimulus. Who says that stimulatory policy fails? George Bush and Dr Hewson are the only two people in the world who say that&mdash;one who lost and one who is losing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party, when it goes to the next election, will put before the people a comprehensive policy program for the fifth term, based on economic growth, decent wages, low inflation, decent social conditions and a cooperative society. When we release the elements of that is a matter for us. If Opposition members are getting frustrated by their position in the polls and wish we would release a policy so that they  might be able to find a problem with it, I am sorry to disappoint them, but we are not going to produce it on cue just for them. When we go to the next election we will be doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a dramatic contrast, and at the next election there will be a dramatic contrast, between Government and Opposition on those five issues: jobs, prices, wages, social welfare conditions and the nature of our cooperative society. They are fundamental to the choices the Australian people will make about the sort of economy and society they want, and fundamental to the response to the issues Senator Hill sought to raise in this matter of public importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear expressions of concern about the unemployed from the Opposition. We heard it from Mr Kennett when he was in opposition. We heard it from Mr Groom when he was in opposition. Mr Groom and Mr Kennett have both made absolutely clear what their solution for unemployment is: they keep sacking people. They say, `The unemployed must be lonely. We will put a few more people on the dole to join them'. Mr Groom this week sacked 200 construction workers from the Tasmanian Government. Mr Kennett is seeking to sack several thousand. That also is the policy of Fightback&mdash;to solve unemployment by sacking people, massive sackings involving hundreds of millions of dollars. The only thing they are going to spend more money on is redundancy payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the issue of prices. For the first time, Australia has not only low inflation but inflation below that of our trading partners.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The price increases generated by the GST will destroy that inflationary achievement even if those opposite are able to achieve their prediction, which I do not believe they will, of making that price increase a one-off. Even if they are able to achieve that, it will break the cycle of inflationary expectations and undermine the competitiveness that we have gained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area of contrast will be wages. The Government is committed to a high wage strategy, not a low wage strategy. One of the key decisions we have to make is the choice between the high wage and low wage strategy. If we want to know what is the Opposition's option, we can look at one of two clear examples that are on the record. One is the policy of the Kennett Liberal Government. It is clear that it is opting for a low wage strategy for Victoria. The other example is the Opposition's with regard to youth wages&mdash;a youth wage of $3 an hour. Those opposite tried to interject today when Senator Cook made the point that the Opposition had proposed a $3 an hour wage, but it is on the record. Those opposite claimed it as a great bonus&mdash;until the young people of Australia rejected it. Now those opposite are trying to hide and say, `We didn't really mean it'. But that is what their policy means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will also be a contrast in social policy. The Opposition's way of improving the conditions for people in need is to slash their support from government and their access to social welfare. When anybody says, `You're going to cut the unemployed off the Jobsearch allowance after nine months', those opposite say, `No, we are not'. Fightback says that the Opposition will save $755m. I think that figure is wrong, but those opposite claim that they will save $755m by throwing people off the unemployment benefit. But they want to make the omelette without breaking the eggs. They say, `We can save the $755m, but no-one will lose anything'. That is where the $755m savings come from. It is $755 taken away from benefits that would otherwise have been provided to people who are unemployed. If no-one will lose, there is no saving. That arithmetic is also compelling. I know it is uncomfortable, but the Australian people are waking up to it. That is why they are making their views clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth area of contrast concerns cooperation. One of the great changes that took place in 1983 was the movement away from industrial confrontation towards cooperation. We have had a decade of the most successful industrial relations management in Australian history, and the lowest level of disputes. The Australian people greatly appreciate that. The last thing they want is to see Australia going back to the bad old days of confrontation; of Australian against Australian; of driving Australia into unnecessary confrontation. That is why the recent ANOP poll, in accordance with the most recent surveys, made it clear that 82 per cent of Australians and 90 per cent of women say they want to keep the current award system. They know that that is where their security lies and that is the way to a cooperative Australia rather than one that is riven by conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alternative that is being proposed by those opposite, which Senator Hill almost forgot to mention&mdash;he got it in in the last 15 seconds&mdash;because the Opposition is now trying to shy away from it, is a recipe for disaster. It is like one of those big signs we see when driving the wrong way on a freeway that says, `Wrong way, go back'. I think the people are showing that to those opposite now. The Australian people are flashing that sign now and saying, `Wrong way, go back'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message from the Australian people is that they do not want sackings, they do not want prices to go up through a GST, they do not want their wages cut, they do not want jobs destroyed by Opposition policies, they do not want the social wage slashed and they do not want cooperation abandoned for confrontation. Until Opposition members learn that lesson they will continue to slide, because the Australian people are too intelligent to fall for a package of policies such as that proposed by the Opposition. The people certainly do not want those policies. The contrast is stark; the choice is clear. As the package unfolds and the people see the choice between growth and contraction, between decent wages and wage cuts, between low inflation and the GST, and between cooperation and confrontation, they will continue to reject the Opposition. </PARA>

On a per capita basis, that growth looks pretty shocking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that the Opposition's Fightback package is simply an extension of economic rationalism, an increase in the flow of wealth from the poor to the rich. The Opposition hopes, rather disingenuously, that the trickle-up phenomenon will result in a trickle-down which, through recovery of the economy, will somehow benefit the less well-off. Well, it has not worked during all the years that Labor has been in office and it will not work under the Opposition. They will be even less well-off under the Opposition when Dr Hewson screws down the bolts on the economy even more tightly than this Government has screwed them down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is required&mdash;and I would agree with Senator McMullan on this point&mdash;is much greater stimulation to the economy, but stimulation which is very selectively targeted into those areas of the economy which fulfil certain criteria. They must provide employment but, in providing that employment, they must also address the problem of foreign indebtedness. In other words, they must address increasing exports and, particularly, import replacement&mdash;something that we have been stressing in recent days through a series of questions to Senator Button, all of which have been totally unsatisfactorily answered. At the same time, the industries which need to be established in this country need to move us towards what governments, at least in theory, recognise&mdash;namely, ecologically sustainable patterns of development, patterns which are sustainable in the future and which do not run up enormous environmental costs which will be paid either by this generation or by later generations. Those are precisely the criteria that we put forward in our Getting to Work document. Those are the criteria we set ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That document contains a number of proposals which do exactly what the Opposition is accusing the Government of not doing. One of the matters to which we give great prominence in that document is that the stimulation clearly cannot come by increasing the deficit still further. We have a large and growing foreign debt. The stimulus can only come by increasing taxation revenue. We are proposing specifically a jobs levy, structured in exactly the same way as the Medicare levy, to raise $2 1/2 billion each year for five years. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This money would be targeted into providing jobs&mdash;and not just any jobs. They would not be just jobs for the sake of jobs; not just jobs such as we saw with the RED scheme under the Whitlam Government&mdash;that is, throwing money at projects, painting  rocks white, as many people have called it&mdash;but jobs which clearly are identified as having a long term social and/or environmental and/or economic benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of such jobs available in this country. There is no shortage of work needing to be done. What is lacking is the money to pay for those jobs to be done, because we are, as everybody needs to recognise&mdash;and it is worth stressing again&mdash;a low tax country, not a high tax country. Compared with all the OECD countries, we share with America the ignominy of being the second lowest tax country of all the OECD countries. Only Turkey has a lower rate of taxation. So those who have jobs, those who are well-off in this blessed country of ours, can afford to find money to provide jobs for those who are less well-off. That is what we should be doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the areas which has been identified as urgently needing work to be done on it is the water supply. The major river system of this country, the Murray-Darling Basin, is in urgent need of reclamation. We are in danger of losing that whole waterway. The blue-green algae threatens the water supply of not only all of the towns along the Murray, but also the city of Adelaide, in which I live. If we lose that Murray-Darling Basin to blue-green algae, Adelaide will lose its water supply, and a city of over a million people will simply disappear because there will be no water to sustain it&mdash;and, particularly, in a dry year when the catchments in the Adelaide Hills are inadequately filled; it is precisely under those conditions that we may well lose the Murray-Darling supply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an enormous amount of work to be done in relation to sewage treatment, the disposal of effluents, run-off from farms, revegetation and so on throughout the whole of the Murray-Darling Basin. Every single city in Australia pours its nutrient-rich fresh water out into the ocean with quite calamitous environmental impacts. Many billions of dollars-worth of work needs to be done to lessen the impact of sewage disposal on the marine environment. The long term ability of that marine environment to supply fish and other necessary biological services to the human population is very much threatened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rail system was also mentioned today. We need to spend quite massive amounts of money on the national rail system.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important to remind the Senate precisely what we are debating. We are debating this matter of public importance in two parts. The first part states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The total failure of the Government's economic program, its refusal to put forward policies to address the national economic crisis&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>One could term that as past failures and the absence of new policies to deal with those failures. The second part states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and its subordination of the public interest in favour of the vested interests of trade union leaders.</PARA>
<PARA>I listened with interest to the contributions from, firstly, Senator McMullan and then Senator Coulter. It was interesting to listen to Senator Coulter because he dedicated much of his speech to the failure of the Government in the areas that were of particular interest to him, whereas the wider community is interested in employment, the failure of the economy and falling standards of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan seemed to be of the view that everything is all right, everything is fine, and if anybody brings forward any bad news then we had better shoot the messenger. He even deigned to single me out for particular comment because I have raised many issues which are of particular embarrassment to the Government. His attitude to that is to sweep it under the carpet and shoot the messenger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am afraid the electorate is not going to put up with that sort of attitude. If we look at the weight of statistics, we see what a failure the past policies have been. Senator Tate said in the chamber the other day that the Government has no policies. That was the one truthful statement that we have heard in a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at figures. Today there are 980,000 Australians out of work, 320,000 of those being long term unemployed&mdash;destroyed lives. Since February alone 72,000 more Australians have lost their jobs. I will deal with Senator McMullan's rather cute definition of growth&mdash;that is, there are more people employed. For every job created since February nine other people have been put out of work&mdash;that is some growth. I see he has left the chamber; he does not like to see his arguments refuted. We have two percentage points growth and he says that is wonderful and that we are ahead of everyone else&mdash;but we are not ahead of our major trading partners and we are not ahead of the people in our own region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four per cent, Mr Keating said: if a government could not do 4 per cent growth, it was not worthy of being re-elected. That is a truthful statement and one that the electorate will no doubt act upon. The One Nation statement said that there would be growth of 4.7 per cent&mdash;wonderful. Then we came back with a little statement around the time of the Budget, and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) said, `No, I think we are doing 3 per cent. We have restructured that down to 2 per cent. Where are we going to end up? In other words, all the projections, all the statements by the Government have been proved to be wrong. Kerry O'Brien on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline </EMPHASIS>the other night did a splendid job showing what a facade, to begin with, the One Nation statement had been and how it had failed on every indicator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That failure means that there are 680,000 children who live in homes where no-one has a job. More than one in six children live in families where the normal breadwinner simply does not have a job. Unemployment in Australia stands at 11.3 per cent. The OECD average, which Senator McMullan chose to use as a comparable figure earlier in the day, is 7.5 per cent. Compared with the last two recessions of 1974-75 and 1982-83, job losses in the current recession have been far more widespread. Recent figures show the largest job losses have occurred in Victoria, with 139,000, and in South Australia, with 20,400. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, the falls have been concentrated in construction, wholesale and retail trade, property and business service, and manufacturing. This is the mess that Jeff Kennett is faced with cleaning up. This is the mess that resulted in a blow-out in the Loan Council approved borrowings, where Victoria borrowed outside the Loan Council limits to the tune of at least $1.3 billion, of which the Treasurer was fully informed on 6 July and chose not to inform the Parliament or the people by declining to include that in Budget Paper No. 4, where that information should have been contained. In other words, we have a sorry state of decline on every indicator. According to the most recently released annual report of the Industry Commission&mdash;a most worthwhile document, which does tell it like it is&mdash;Australia's productivity levels are substantially below those achieved by countries such as the United States and Japan. Productivity in electricity, for instance, is only 70 per cent of that in the United States. The productivity of railways in Australia, which was supposed to be a central feature of the One Nation statement, is only 10 to 30 per cent of that in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policies of this Government have simply led Australia into a decline. Remember, we went in first. Well may the Government argue that the rest of the world is suffering from recessionary impacts, but we went in as a deliberate plan. Mr Keating told us, `This is the recession we have to have'. This is the recession that he described in terms of `lovely numbers'. This is something he was anticipating, and initially he told us we would have a soft landing. In other words, the word of the Prime Minister cannot be relied upon in any statement that he makes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we see this sudden flurry, this activity on the industrial relations front, particularly in Victoria, where we see the sudden resuscitation of Mr Halfpenny, kept quiescent for 10 years&mdash;</PARA>

But the moment the protection money is cut off and not paid any more, along come the bully boys, who start to smash the windows in or destroy the power supply or say that public transport will not run.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who have we got as Minister for Industrial Relations? I am pleased to see that Senator Cook has come in. We frequently wonder whether he is speaking as a Minister of the Crown, charged with the peace, welfare and good government of Australia or whether he speaks with his old voice as trade union official, a current, card-carrying member of that well known and highly respected organisation, the BWIU. On one occasion it took us 2 1/2 hours to get the Minister to admit that he was a paid up card-carrying member of the BWIU. He claimed at the end of the 2 1/2 hours of debate that it was all disclosed anyway. Again and again at the beginning of that debate he was asked by Senator Crane whether he was a paid up member of the BWIU. I asked him myself, but it was not until we sent out for the official record that we finally had it disclosed in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Well we might ask, when we have seen examples of the power and influence of the ACTU, of which the Minister also was a pre-eminent official during his earlier years&mdash;whether Mr Kelty has been the unofficial member at the Cabinet table, the man who in fact said what policies could go forward and what could not. Well we remember when Mr Keating was pushing his cart. Remember option C&mdash;the one that was going to have a broad-based consumption tax? It was all going fantastically, right up to the moment of the summit, until Mr Kelty summoned the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, in the dark of night, at midnight, to a motel down the road, where he said, `It's not on'. Back they came into the summit, and suddenly, after weeks of saying, `I won't change my mind; this is necessary for the economy', the trade union movement pulled the strings, called the tune, and the Government did a double somersault, reversed its previous policy, and said, `No, we are not going to have that policy right now'. We remember it well. It was well documented: the motel in the middle of the night and who summoned them to the meeting&mdash;Mr Kelty, the unnamed person at the Cabinet table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the money supply, let us remind ourselves how much money it is. In the last 10 years the trade union movement has been paid conservatively $41m of taxpayers' money. That is pretty good protection money in anyone's book. That is about to get cut off at the knees. As well, we have all the trade union people who have been appointed to boards and committees. We have had today the TUTA report. Jenny George has been pre-eminent, I think, in this latest industrial thuggery. She gets paid $11,000 per annum for that job. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bishop's contribution to this debate was no surprise. She has carried on a long-standing tradition of attacking the backgrounds of members of the Government. It is a particularly unfortunate aspect of the debate on economic policy and other debates that take place in this chamber that the Opposition insists upon that method of attack. It does not do those opposite any credit. I am pleased to say that the Government does not reflect on the backgrounds of honourable senators opposite&mdash;whether they come from a farming background, a business background or a law background&mdash;and assume that they carry some vested interest into this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a very serious economic recession in Australia at the present time, and there are a number of reasons for it. There is no doubt that interest rates were kept too high for too long, and that has contributed to the recession we face. The rest of the world is experiencing a recession as well. No matter what we might say and do, we cannot divorce our economy from the rest of the world. As part of that, there is a massive upheaval taking place in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. There are significant trade problems, and we all know the difficulties we are having with the negotiations in the GATT Round on trade and the barriers that have been erected to many of our exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are undertaking a significant restructuring with the introduction of new technology into the economy. It would have been well and good if those opposite, who were in government for decades, had started this process, but alas, they did very little but twiddle their thumbs and let the world go by. They did not commence the necessary restructuring of our economy. The longer that restructuring is left, the worse the restructuring is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fourth factor that is not often mentioned is the cultural insularity of Australia as a nation and the particular problems we have to face up to. The basic reason this economy is in a recession is not labour inflexibility, not an alleged lack of freedom in the labour market, not irresponsible trade unions&mdash;as the topic of the debate clearly implies and as members opposite have been clearly attempting to outline in their various speeches&mdash;and not the trade union movement. The trade union movement in the past decade has been very responsible, as illustrated by admissions by management that trade unions have taken their part positively in negotiations on industry restructuring and award restructuring and as illustrated by the decline in the number of industrial disputes over the last decade&mdash;a very significant decline and a decline that occurred well before the current recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the Opposition's solution? Where does it lay the blame? It says that the blame is to be laid on the trade union movement and the members of trade unions, the workers in this country. It lays the blame at the feet of the trade union movement and its members. Its solution at both State and Federal level is to introduce a system of individual work contracts; to abolish the independent industrial commissions, at least in the State of Victoria, which ensure that contracts are fair and reasonable; and to scrap weekend and night shift penalties. The Opposition advocates all of those things as solutions when in fact those things have not had anything to do with the cause of the economic recession in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's solution is quite interesting. One of the central points of its solution to the recession is to punish those people who are the very victims of the recession and who are not in a position to defend themselves individually against employers in negotiating their wages, their conditions, their superannuation and suchlike. The Opposition has put forward as part of its solution&mdash;from its so-called Fightback, `Frightpack', Doomsday Book; all the other names it has been given&mdash;individual work contracts, the scrapping of the current industrial relations system. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get to our policies in a moment. It has also put forward a goods and services tax. Interestingly, there has been some debate about how popular this GST is in New Zealand. I have just been on a delegation to Canada. The conservative government introduced a goods and services tax there of 7 per cent with many goods being exempt. It is so unpopular in Canada that the conservative provincial governments took their own Federal Government to court to try to stop the introduction of a GST. That is how popular it is in Canada. Frankly, I hope the Opposition continues to think it will be a popular policy because it is one of those policies which will ensure that the Opposition will not be elected. The Opposition's policies are labour market reform and a goods and services tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, Australia's major export now is tourism. The tourism industry is now the leading export earner of this country. What will a goods and services tax do? It will put a 15 per cent impost on tourism. It will flatten the tourism industry. The Opposition well knows that members and representatives of the tourism industry have been lobbying fast and furious to have the tourism industry exempt because the abolition of the wholesale sales tax and payroll tax on that industry will have a negligible offsetting effect against the cost of a goods and services tax. So the Opposition's solution is to bash and comatose Australia's biggest export industry and destroy the only industry at the moment which is rapidly expanding and absorbing some of the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is obsessed with trade unions. The motion before us highlights that. The Opposition believes that trade unions are the root of all evil in this country when clearly that is not the case. Senator Bishop referred to the various funds that were allocated to the trade union movement, but she failed to mention that there is just as much money&mdash;in fact, in some years much more money&mdash;allocated to various business and management organisations in this country to ensure that those organisations are effectively equipped to participate in the restructuring of our industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance is an important debate. The ability to cover it all is beyond me&mdash;and probably beyond any reasonable speaker. Most of the debate has been about whose father is the biggest fellow on the block and who is going to do best. It has been peppered with some unkind observations from each side about the other. The issue that underlies this debate is a very important one: the suffering that is going on in the community because of the economic recession. We as a chamber have to understand that people throughout Australia are suffering because they are without a job or there is the threat that they or their children may be without a job in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is proper that policies should be discussed. Indeed, they have been discussed during the time that this Parliament has been meeting. I do not know whether we get very far by seeking out scapegoats. Senator Cook has not always been the popular man with those on the other side. I doubt whether any flowers come to his door from the other side. However, it is unfair to single out his proud, may I say, periods of office in the BWIU and the ACTU. It is unfair to criticise Senator Cook on the basis of what he did prior to coming here and attributing to him a perversion of his task because of his previous occupation. That sort of thing could be attributed to any of us in respect of what we may or may not do in the chamber. It is proper and right that people should come into this place from a wide variety of backgrounds. I can say about Senator Cook that he is a man whose integrity has never been impugned and a man who has carried out his job and his Ministry in an exemplary fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what the unions do. This is very important at the moment. In Victoria, tribunals outside the employer group and outside the employee group were set up to deal with matters that arise in the workplace. The Accident Compensation Tribunal was set up as an independent body, with its 11 members being given the status of County Court judges, to decide whether the compensation people got because of injuries they suffered in the workplace were fair or otherwise. Another body set up was the Industrial Relations Commission, whose task was to see that conditions of work&mdash;whether in the factory, the office or elsewhere&mdash;were fair. As a result of this new Government coming in, the Accident Compensation Tribunal and the Industrial Relations Commission have been abolished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a matter of concern for people who are liable to suffer from severe injuries such as the loss of a leg below the knee or the loss of a non-dominant hand. It is very difficult for them to be faced with the proposition and the reality that after two years of compensation, they have to cover the situation themselves. After two years, people who, through no fault of their own, have been fearfully injured in the workplace&mdash;who are injured perhaps through the fault of the employer&mdash;must, nevertheless, look to social security payments to fix them up for the rest of their life. They may live a long time and thus may be condemned to a very impecunious situation, whereas otherwise they could have lived very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect there has to be some sort of group in which they can gather and that is provided by the union movement. In so far as the Federal system is concerned, that is provided by the union movement under the Australian Industrial Relations Act of 1988. This Act provides that the officers of those unions will be elected in accordance with strict requirements by the people who are in the unions. When we talk about union bosses we are talking about bosses who have been elected according to the formula set out in this particular Act, which passed through this Parliament as recently as 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That legislation is subject to further amendment. If the Opposition, or indeed anybody on this side, says that the union officials are not elected properly and in accordance with the desires of the majority of their members, then there ought to be brought forward a provision to ensure that that is done. As far as I am concerned, no attempt has been made&mdash;and certainly no suggestion has been made in this debate&mdash;to amend that Act which sets out a democratic way of electing union officials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government wants to enable more people to come under that system if they wish to do so. It has been said that this gives the unions the opportunity to come under the Federal scheme if they so desire, but it does not give people that same opportunity. To some extent that is true because the system that is set up federally is one that is based on the existence of organisations of employers and organisations of employees. People have to be in a union to be covered by the Act, as it now exists. They voluntarily become members of the union&mdash;in spite of what is being said here&mdash;and, as members of that union, they have a right to vote for the leadership. What has been offered by the Minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is a further opportunity for people who would otherwise be without sufficient strength to negotiate in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just give an illustration of that. Much has been made in this chamber recently of the Copperart contract. Much debate has occurred as to whether it is a good or a poor contract, but what is clear is that it is a contract written by an employer, not by an employee.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.3<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comment: The Government does not believe there is sufficient evidence to support the need for an investigation of the performance of overseas posts undertaking electoral responsibilities. Prior to the 1990 election the procedures for persons assisting with the issue of overseas votes were extensively revised. Further, a Commission officer presents a briefing session on the election process at all Consular Training Courses held for Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade staff prior to their departure overseas. These briefings are conducted approximately every six weeks. The procedures for overseas posts explain fully the process of voting, however, the Commission is limited in further action it can take. In fact overseas staff are under no obligation to undertake the duties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.4<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendation that overseas declaration votes be returned prior to polling day is impractical as voting overseas can take place up to and including polling day, depending on the post's location. The changes to procedure for the 1990 election included revised despatch arrangements for ballot material back to Australia which involved the use of an international courier instead of diplomatic bags, and as a consequence, there were delays only in a few locations where the courier did not operate. No final counting was delayed as a consequence, unlike previous elections.</PARA>

The Commission has not been involved with despatch of party how-to-vote material and to do so could be seen as infringing upon its neutrality. As to its display, the Commissions's instructions state that all material received should be displayed but in an area separate from the area where voting is taking place. The Commission does not have any legal basis for insisting that how-to-vote material be displayed. This is a matter for the candidates and the parties to negotiate with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">27.5<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be emphasised that the thrust of the system is the equitable distribution of available funding between a large number of offices discharging the same functions.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additional resources will be required to achieve this recommendation as the program does not yet operate nationally. These will be sought through the 1992/93 budget process.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. The Australian Electoral Commission take immediate steps to present policy proposals to relevant state governments for the extension of AIEIS to Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in NSW, Victoria, and those parts of Queensland not already served (3.17)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Significant progress has been made towards extending AIEIS in 2 of the 3 States mentioned in this recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A third Field Officer has been recruited for Queensland and this will provide coverage for the entire State. The formation of the new Queensland Electoral Commission may allow for improved coordination of the operation of the program in that State.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A New Policy Proposal seeking the required resources will be prepared for consideration in the budget context for the 1992/93 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the AIEIS program has and should include elements of education, information enrolment and roll cleansing, a clear statement of the program's objectives will be prepared identifying education as the highest priority among these sometimes competing activities. This emphasis will be conveyed to state and divisional staff to overcome the current confusion between the priorities given to education and enrolment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While AIEIS field staff will be expected to assist with enrolment drives and engage in incidental enrolment in the normal course of their work their assistance in formal enrolment drives will be negotiated between senior AIEIS management and state and divisional staff as the need arises.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Coverage of state or local government elections is already provided by field officers in their work in the communities. Significant progress has been made in the States/Territory where the program operates to increasing this element of the program with information on State and Local Government elections being included in training and information materials. Relevant State electoral and local government bodies have been assisting the Commission by providing this information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, information on ATSIC elections is being incorporated in the program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. Basic facts and procedural information on the role of political parties be included in the AIEIS program (3.26)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is already done to the extent consistent with the need for the public to maintain confidence in the neutrality of the AEC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Community Electoral Assistant training manual incorporates a section on the role of political parties and officers discuss in training sessions how parties operate, the selection of party candidates, group voting tickets etc. As noted in the Report the AEC should not be involved in disseminating party literature. (3.25)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9. There be greater emphasis placed on fostering wider community interest and developing stronger community participation in disseminating electoral education and information via the AIEIS program (6.7)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The program already operates with considerable support from and close liaison with Aboriginal community organisations. A meeting was held in January 1992 to review the current AIEIS remote area strategy with one aim being the formalising of wider community participation, including community school activities. This has been agreed to and has been included in the program objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10. Senior management of the Australian Electoral Commission develop and disseminate an appropriately informed, active and supportive attitude with regard to the AIEIS program (5.6)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senior management of the AEC is highly supportive of the AIEIS program (30% of the total Information and Education budget is allocated to the program annually).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senior Central Office management will ensure, however, that this supportive attitude is clearly understood by all staff concerned in State and Divisional Offices and by field staff. In particular, clear policy directions and lines of control for the program will ensure that there is no potential for confusion in the minds of those staff about the supervision and reporting arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11. The existing National Coordinator become the coordinator for the Remote Area Strategy and continue being responsible for the strategy in all states, except Tasmania, where the program currently operates (5.27)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not agreed (see Recommendation 12.).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12. A new coordinator position be created at the Senior Officer Grade C level, and its responsibilities encompass the AIEIS program in the eastern states, focusing on the new Urban Area Strategy in New South Wales, southern Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria (5.27)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission believes that two field coordinators for a program with only 12.5 officers is unnecessary and that one coordinator is adequate for the program. To have two coordinators would draw heavily on limited resources otherwise available for use in implementing the program. The Director Education position in Central Office also has considerable involvement in the management of the program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current National Coordinator position is a Central Office position outposted to Broome. With the extension of the program in the eastern states the position will be re-located in Canberra to facilitate coordination of the remote area and the urban aspects of the program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13. The Australian Electoral Commission take immediate steps to fill all vacant field officer positions in their current locations and undertake to maintain AIEIS staffing at an optimum level (4.4)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed, subject to resource availability (as with the rest of the AEC, the program is subject to the efficiency dividend and this has had an impact on the AEC's ability to fill positions).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"All positions existing at the time of the JSC enquiry are filled with the exception of a position in WA. This position will be filled in December 1992. In addition, two positions (NSW and QLD) funded by a New Policy Proposal in 1991 have been filled. The 1992 New Policy Proposal has provided funding for five additional positions. Of these positions, one field officer (QLD) has commenced duty. Recruitment action has commenced for the other four positions and the new officers will commence work by the end of 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14. Community Electoral Assistant selection occur only as a result of consultation between field officers and the community concerned (4.27)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is standard practice in all communities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15. The Assistant Commissioner, Information Education report regularly to the Australian Electoral Commissioner on the way in which the AIEIS program is operating on a nationally coordinated basis (5.27)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16. Field Officers' monthly reports and any additional relevant management information be forwarded simultaneously from Australian Electoral Officers to the Australian Electoral Commissioner and the relevant program coordinator (5.27)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reports required by Recommendation 15 will be in sufficient detail to obviate the need for the Electoral Commissioner to read some 13 field reports each month. Field reports are currently circulated to the National Coordinator, State Supervisors and the Director Education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17. In its annual report the Australian Electoral Commission report more fully on the AIEIS program with specific reference to staffing, funding and the achievement of objectives (5.27)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed. Recent Annual Reports have carried increasing detail on this and other programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other Recommendations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18. The Australian Electoral Commission explore the possibility of securing funding from state and local government bodies for the development of state and local government components in the AIEIS program (3.22)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed. Such bodies will be approached for financial contributions to these components.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">19. The Australian Electoral Commission investigate funding options open to AIEIS and develop a strategy for the exploitation of alternative funding sources, especially the further use of the Community Development Employment Project scheme where appropriate (4.41)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the initiative of the AEC, some AIEIS activities have already been funded by CDEP. In some states, however, the interpretation of guidelines for the use of these funds is such that AIEIS can make only very restricted use of them. Further discussions will be held with ATSIC in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">20. The Australian Electoral Commission make all information concerning AIEIS funding publicly available both within and outside the Commission (4.39)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Information in AIEIS funding should be available within and outside the Commission on the same basis as funding information on its other programs. Funding information for this program is available to all Commission staff and to a wider public on request or through its listing in the ATSIC consolidated list of government spending on Aboriginal programs. More detailed information will also be included in the Commission's Annual Report (see Recommendation 17). The forthcoming introduction of the AEC's FMIS should also assist in the provision of funding information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">21. The Australian Electoral Commission undertake immediate recruitment action to fill the Western Australia field officer position in the Kimberleys (4.10)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">See response to Recommendation 13.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">22. In the selection of field officers, greater emphasis be placed on the desirability of applicants:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">having a background or training in, or aptitude for, education; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">being willing and capable of spending most of their time in the field (4.18)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These qualities are already essential criteria for the selection process for these positions. This is reflected in the selection documentation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">23. Field officers be provided with adequate, suitable and properly equipped office accommodation (4.21)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission currently provides satisfactory accommodation and equipment for all Field Officers who are also supported by non-dedicated AEC resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">24. The Australian Electoral Commission specify that field officers' resources and facilities are for the AIEIS program and not to be appropriated for other Australian Electoral Commission activities (4.23)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is already done. Careful monitoring of the program ensures that to the maximum extent possible funds allocated to the program are used for the program. Operational requirements and effective use of resources mean, however, that on occasions there must be appropriate flexibility across program lines. It should also be noted that non-dedicated AEC resources are used to support the program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">25. The Australian Electoral Commission immediately institute policies which ensure fair and consistent treatment for all Community Electoral Assistants and that their value to the Australian Electoral Commission be recognised and promoted throughout the Commission, especially at divisional level (4.31)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The instances that lead to this recommendation have been rectified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">26. The recruiting of AIEIS officers for urban areas be carried out only after the development of a separate urban strategy which includes selection relevant to urban areas (4.36)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that the Commission is recruiting a Field Officer in early 1992 to work in NSW. With reference to the response to Recommendation 4, the urban area strategy will be in place by the time that this officer has been recruited and completed initial training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">27. In performing their respective roles, especially with regard to the conduct of elections, AIEIS and other Australian Electoral Commission officers develop strategies for benefiting from each others' skills and experiences (5.9)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">28. The new coordinator position be funded using the additional resources sought in the current budget (5.27)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not Agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">See response to Recommendation 12. The additional resources allocated in the current budget were sufficient to employ only 2 additional Field Officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">29. Both coordinators report directly to the Director of Education, Australian Electoral Commission (5.27)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coordinator has always reported directly to the Director Education. (Note: With reference to Recommendation 12, only 1 coordinator position is supported).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">30. Both coordinators be used as a source of advice for state managers on the best methods of implementing the program in their state including advice on dealing with any problems that may arise (5.27)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has always been an important aspect of the role of the coordinator and will continue to be so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(See note to response to Recommendation 29).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">31. The Australian Electoral Commission recognise the importance of the Education Officer to the AIEIS program and that it ensure the provision of well-planned and high-quality resource material by maintaining in the Education Officer position a permanent officer with appropriate training and skills (4.13)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AIEIS education officer position is currently filled by a two-year appointment. The occupant was appointed in April 1991. Consideration will be given to the long-term nature of the position prior to the end of the current 2 year appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">32. The Education Officer report to the Director of Education and provide curriculum materials and support for both the Remote and Urban Area Strategies (5.27)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation was made in the context of there being two coordinators (Rec 12). With the Electoral Commission Coordinator position to be located in Canberra, it will be even more effective for the Education Officer position to work directly to the Coordinator.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">33. The Australian Electoral Commission apply existing performance indicators to assessment of the AIEIS program and report on them in its Portfolio Performance Statements (5.32)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">34. Twelve months after the tabling of this report, the management of the AIEIS program be subject to an internal evaluation by the Australian Electoral Commission and that the report of that evaluation be referred to the Minister (5.29)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In assessing the outcome of such a review, however, it should be noted that, until additional resources are provided via the 1992/93 budget process (with funding actually being allocated to the Commission in December 1992 should funding be approved), it will not be possible to expand the program nationally prior to the proposed time of the review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">35. All policies for the future of AIEIS include an achievable timetable and provide for the program's reduction to a care and maintenance level within a timeframe which allows for the satisfactory realisation of all goals (3.28)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since 1989 the remote area strategy has included this information and it will be included in the forthcoming urban strategy. Timetables are revised if necessary following program reviews, electoral events or other matters impinging upon the program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">36. Experience and information gained in the field be used as a basis for reorientating the AIEIS program toward greater emphasis on local priorities thereby making it more relevant to the electoral education and information needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people (6.3)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The whole thrust of the program, the field officer structure and the relative independence with which field officers go about their work allows for the meeting of local priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">37. The Australian Electoral Commission explore the possibility of developing formal working relationships with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations and groups (6.14)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission will discuss with ATSIC and the other relevant bodies the re-establishment of a small committee to formalise the Commission's already close and productive working relationship with such bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">38. That AIEIS field officers work with schools and other secondary educational institutions with a view to introducing the AIEIS program to older high school students (6.14)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has been done in an ad-hoc manner in the past. School visits have now been formally incorporated into the program objectives and strategy documents and work has commenced on resource materials for use in remote community schools.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">39. In the production of AIEIS curriculum and motivational materials, greater emphasis should be given to the use of local material and content and local input should be solicited (6.18)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has been done to some extent since the inception of the program and has been done increasingly in recent years for the vast majority of information and education materials used by the program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">40. Audio-visual aids, particularly videos, become a major method of delivery for AIEIS curriculum and motivational materials (6.21)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Audio-visual materials have long formed a major method of delivery of the program. Additional audio-visual materials are currently being produced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">41. The Australian Electoral Commission explore all options for the exploitation of the Broadcasting for Remote Aboriginal Communities Scheme (BRACS) as a means of conveying AIEIS material (6.21)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BRACS has already been used in a minor way for information/advertising purposes. This use will increase considerably in the future with a stronger recommendation of the use of BRACS in the program strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">42. The Australian Electoral Commission immediately institute a thorough review of the AIEIS program's content, its methods of delivery and the materials it uses with a view to making the program accessible to and effective for the widest possible client base (6.24)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The content, method of delivery and material used in this program are reviewed on an annual basis with input from all field officers. The program's objectives and remote area strategy were comprehensively reviewed in January 1992, with representatives of client groups being involved in the review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">43. Information and materials for a parliamentary education component of the AIEIS program be planned and developed in cooperation with the Parliamentary Education Office (3.26)</PARA>

<PARA>This is an important annual report from the Department of the Treasury, one of the pre-eminent departments in our structure of government. Unfortunately, given the short time we have had in which to read the report and make comments, I plan to restrict my remarks to two aspects. The report in my view deals very inadequately with one of the major issues which surrounded the Treasury during the last year. I refer to the establishment in the Treasury, at the instructions of the Government, of the so-called micro-economic modelling unit whose prime task is to work over the Fightback document which has been presented by John Hewson and Peter Reith as the coalition's policy as we go towards the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This action by the Treasury, the way that unit was run, has become a matter of high public controversy. A number of Estimates committees have dealt with that issue, particularly the role that the Secretary to the Department of the Treasury, Mr Cole, and the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury, Dr Preston, played in the establishment of the unit and the apparent lack of proper control over the work of that unit. If one reads this report, one will not be greatly enlightened as to the nature of the controversy which surrounded the unit. It is referred to very briefly in a number of sections. It is referred to on pages 10 and 15, with a larger section on page 43. Essentially, the Treasury tells us that the software, the so-called PRISMOD, was used at the request of the Government to analyse the effects of some elements of the Opposition's Fightback package. It principally proposed changes to indirect taxes, personal income taxes, transfer payments and changes to health insurance arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report points out that the results of the analysis were publicly released on 3 March&mdash;and honourable senators will recall the events surrounding that release. I have spoken on this particular issue on a number of occasions in this chamber. I wish again to record the fact that it is interesting that here we have a document which purports to be a summary of the Treasury's activities in the year 1991-92 and, so far as I can see in the short period of time I have had to flip through this document, no comment has been made about the nature of the dispute which surrounded the role of the Treasury in the analysis of the Fightback document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am on record in stating my belief that this was a fundamental change in the role of the Public Service. It was an astonishing use of the Treasury. It showed a complete lack of any sort of ethical behaviour by the Government to involve the Treasury in this type of work. Regrettably, it showed that the Treasury officers directly involved perhaps had forgotten the great traditions of public service in this country. The Government instructed them to get up out of the trenches, fire shots at the Opposition and then, when a couple of shots were fired back, there were enormous complaints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to people in the Public Service that if they are foolish enough, upon being asked by the Government, to get out of the trench and start firing at the political enemies of the Government, they are extraordinarily hopeful if they think that they can emerge unscathed from this type of dispute. I think the incident which occurred in relation to Treasury is regrettable. </PARA>

In my view, if officers want to get out of the trenches at the instructions of their political masters and start to take pot shots at the Opposition, they cannot expect to escape unscathed. In my view, it is Senator Cook's colleagues who have to be very careful about using public servants in that manner. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>In speaking on the third annual report of Landcare Australia Ltd, I first want to congratulate all of those throughout the Australian community who are making strenuous efforts to promote soil conservation activities across Australia. I want especially to congratulate the two Queensland winners of the national Landcare Australia awards who are mentioned here in the report. I refer to Dr Brian Roberts, who is head of land use studies at the University College of Southern Queensland and the Hermitage Fallow Management Group in Queensland. Dr Roberts has spent his entire working life in teaching, researching and spreading the word about soil conservation and land use planning, while the fallow group has led the way in reduced tillage and stubble retention practices in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years we have often heard of several pressing environmental matters, including energy, pollution and the greenhouse effect, which have been competing for the public's attention. But soil degradation is our most basic issue, I venture to say. It is often forgotten in the media and there do not seem to be very many votes in this issue when politicians parade before the public their concerns about the environment. Yet, as I have said, soil degradation is Australia's No. 1 environmental issue. Indeed, the report notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The company's awareness raising activity during the year has targeted a wider audience of urban and rural Australians thanks to the support of . . . the National Soil Conservation Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over thousands of years floods, dry spells and the prevailing wind patterns have combined to strip numerous layers of the fine fertile soil from Australia's surface. Regrettably, that is what is happening in Queensland at the present time&mdash;or to  the vast majority of Queensland&mdash;while southern parts of Australia, down here around Canberra, Victoria and very many other States are having the most wonderful rain. Even in Western Australia, Mr Acting Deputy President, I think you have had good rain, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, a lot of this fine, fertile soil has been blown away and has ended up in the Pacific and Indian oceans, stretching out from the coastline in two plumes to the north-west and the south-east, mirroring the prevailing wind systems. We all would have read numerous stories about windblown soil from the Australian mainland which is regularly dumped on the New Zealand alps. Nothing is more important to a nation's environment than its soil and the preservation of the quality of its land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The loss of our thin and fragile soil, the progressive degradation of our land and the expansion of the desert and arid areas of the Australian continent are our number one environmental challenge. We have seen in our Queensland papers the story of how so much of inland Queensland is gradually turning into desert. It really makes one very sad and feel very sorry for people who are on the land out in far-flung western Queensland, where they are having such a bad time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By 1983, about 66 per cent of all our land was in need of some conservation measures. Significant long term problems have also arisen as a result of the progressive breaking down of the structure of Australian soils. Soil conservation is not only of particular importance to the Greenies, to whom the Government and the media often pander, but also of vital importance to those Australians who often have much more to do with the environment&mdash;that is, the man and the woman on the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only in the past few years has soil degradation come a little into focus. This has been partly because during the past few years Australia has experienced a series of storms, droughts and floods which were directly or indirectly related to the problem. Indeed, the disastrous drought experienced by Queensland last year, and still being experienced in some areas, resulted in unheard of dust storms blanketing cities, such as Brisbane, with a constant haze of fine soil swept off the once beautiful topsoil of the Darling Downs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is estimated that about half of Australia's rural land requires treatment for degradation. Human activity has been responsible for about half of that degradation. That, of course, is why we are very interested in the Landcare Australia Ltd third annual report. It is something that we really want and need. Australian farmers play a leading role in the environment, caring for over 200 million animals and millions of square kilometres of land. To a remarkable degree the care of this nation's environment is already in their hands. </PARA>

I take this opportunity of congratulating a number of people on the effort they have put into the land care and national soil conservation program during the past 12 months and, of course, since its inception. I particularly draw the attention of the Senate to two award winners from Western Australia. The first one was Alcoa Australia Ltd, which set up a number of programs demonstrating rehabilitation techniques. In congratulating Alcoa, I also acknowledge that there are a number of other companies in Western Australia, and I guess elsewhere in Australia, which are putting significant resources into this very important initiative and requirement for tackling the issue of degradation.

I also acknowledge Mr Elton Butcher, a Pithara farmer, who became chairman of the Soil and Land Conservation Council in Western Australia 10 or 11 years ago and has filled that position in a very capable, positive and strong manner. He has given distinguished service to Western Australia in the area of conservation. Mr Butcher travels from one end of the State to the other assisting in the various conservation districts.

<PARA>Coming from Queensland, which is a very important State for tourism in Australia, I am very pleased to be able to say something about the report of the Bureau of Tourism Research. Tourism is one of Australia's largest and fastest growing industries. It has the potential to make a significant contribution to the nation's future economic development, and perhaps our Government ought to listen to that point. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By any standard it is already a significant industry. In 1990/91 tourist expenditure within Australia amounted to $25 billion and tourism's contribution to GDP exceeded 5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>Tourism accounts for around 450,000 jobs, either directly or indirectly, or 5.8 per cent of the work force. During the 1990s, the industry is expected to create up to 200,000 new jobs, representing 16 per cent of all new jobs in the economy. As the report notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . employment in tourism related industries increased during the period that the Australian economy was in recession while employment overall declined.</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose it would be easy to say that our tourism performance is going fairly well, but in reality there are a number of difficulties within the Australian tourism industry. While the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) might say that the recession is over, one knows that the figures prove that it is certainly not. One has only to look at the latest reports released in October by the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation to see that a number of our major tourist attractions are in some trouble because people just cannot afford to stay there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seventy per cent of the tourist industry is the domestic industry. We are seeing a boom in caravan parks and in low cost accommodation while a lot of Australia's very important infrastructure is being under-utilised because Australians just cannot afford to go there. While the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government is very much the promotion of Australia overseas, we in the Opposition have some very real criticism of the way the Government is approaching the situation. The decisions that will have to be made about Australian tourism over the next 18 months to two years are the most important in the industry's history. If we play our cards correctly, we have a great opportunity to become a major force in world tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its studies of last year, the World Tourism Organisation estimated that, by the year 2000, 140 million Asians annually will be travelling offshore for their holidays. If Australia got five per cent of that business, it could not handle it. Since 1985, overseas visitor numbers have more than doubled to a record 2.4 million in 1991. Our major markets are Japan and New Zealand, which account for 43 per cent of all visitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the 1990s overseas visitor numbers are expected to more than double again, to between 4.8 million and 6.5 million by the year 2000. This will be accompanied by a significant change in the market mix, with Japan and Asia becoming more dominant markets. However, as I said earlier, domestic tourism is still the lifeblood of the industry, accounting for over 70 per cent of tourism business. Indeed, this time last year the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> published a report that stated:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few minutes that I have had to peruse the report from the Bureau of Tourism Research, I have been impressed with the detail it has gone into, and I congratulate the Bureau on the work it has done. I join with my Queensland colleague Senator Bjelke-Petersen in paying tribute to the tourism industry in Australia in general but to the tourist industry in Queensland in particular. The area where I live in the north of Queensland&mdash;around Townsville, Cairns and the Whitsunday Islands&mdash;is indeed one of the premier tourist attractions and destinations for both Australian and international tourists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Bjelke-Petersen has mentioned, and as is mentioned in this report of the Bureau, in 1990-91 tourist expenditure within Australia amounted to $25 billion. Tourism contributed a fraction more than 5 per cent to the nation's GDP. Expenditure by international visitors exceeded $7 billion in 1990-91, and the return from tourism has superseded our more traditional exports such has coal, wool and wheat in terms of its contribution to export earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that same year, the number of jobs generated by tourism reached around 450,000. It is significant that this increase in job numbers occurred at a time when Australia was in the depths of the worst recession since the 1930s&mdash;a recession this Government created. In spite of that, the tourism industry has managed to expand. A report issued just last week, I think, by a Cairns based economic unit indicated that over half of the new jobs created in Australia in the last year were created in the Cairns region as a result of tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the Government has done everything possible to impede business generally in Australia, and that includes the tourism industry, under the new government which will take office after the next election the tourist industry will get a real boost, particularly from a couple of areas. The labour market reform that the coalition has proposed will be of significant benefit to the tourism industry. No longer will the tourism industry be impeded by inflexible, centralised wage and industrial relations rules and conditions. Conditions will be able to be negotiated between the tourist industry and the employees in those areas themselves. That is particularly important in an industry which requires wide flexibility&mdash;it requires an ability to work at odd sorts of hours and on all days of the week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's proposals for labour market reform will be particularly significant to the tourist operators. I might say that this is one of the coalition's policies that is being particularly well received up my way in the far north of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Bjelke-Petersen has mentioned, a significant part of our tourism in Australia is internal tourism&mdash;tourism that travels principally by road. Our proposal to remove some 19c a litre&mdash;almost 20c a litre&mdash;from the price of petrol will be a real boost to those Australians who drive to their holiday destinations. That, to a general extent, encompasses the lower end of the market&mdash;the ordinary Australians who once every couple of years get in the car and go for a holiday at some tourist caravan park. That significant reduction in the price of their fuel will encourage them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess what will encourage them more is that once there is a new government people's jobs will be guaranteed again. At the present time people are unwilling to take holidays because they are not quite sure that they will still have a job when they come back. Under the new government, people will be able to take those holidays with the certainty of a job on their return, and that will be tremendous for the tourism industry. All of the coalition's policies will be great for tourism. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>Of the vast number of reports that the Government has put down today, I suspect that this is the most dramatic.

Although I have not had a chance to do more than glance at it today, it will obviously be a very worthwhile addition to source material on this very important subject of Australia's contribution to promoting and protecting human rights. Even in the few moments I have had in which to look at the report, I am pleased to see that a number of issues which have been raised have principally found support of the Committee in that it is supportive of matters that the Opposition has put forward in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those matters relates to a suggestion that we have been pursuing of promoting a human rights forum within the region. A lot of publicity is given to obvious leverage that is used by Australia to try to influence improvements in international human rights. Pressure is applied diplomatically, sometimes through restraints upon Australia's foreign aid, as in the case of Burma; sometimes through restraints on trade, with the application of trade sanctions, as in the case of South Africa. However, not so much attention is given to efforts to encourage change through the development of regional bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the world, in many regions, human rights mechanisms have been established, usually in the form of some type of regional human rights convention supported by, in some instances, a human rights court and other mechanism. But it certainly has not been attempted within the Asia-Pacific region. I have been suggesting encouraging Asian states, in particular&mdash;where sadly there are deficiencies in their human rights records&mdash;to join together and look to enhance their standing internationally by sponsoring a human rights forum to encourage each other to develop and be party to a regional convention and also to encourage each other to adhere to the standards that would be contained within that convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that that idea has been taken up by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade of this Parliament. I hope the Government will now also respond positively. If it does, that will be a worthwhile contribution in a constructive, positive way towards improving human rights throughout this region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased to see that the Committee took up the issue of Sri Lanka. Some years ago we suggested that Australia should seek to get the Commonwealth involved in the very sad Sri Lankan conflict in which there had been an enormous amount of death and suffering. On examination of that tragedy, the UN found the level of disappearances in Sri Lanka higher than anywhere else it had studied in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government, to some limited degree, did take up that suggestion and there was some lobbying for a Commonwealth role. I took it up with the Commonwealth secretariat and other states. Whereas there has been some mouthing of support, because the Sri Lankan Government has not been prepared to invite the Commonwealth, the issue has not gone any further. I am pleased this Committee sees merit in Commonwealth involvement and I hope that also will give greater support to the Australian Government to get back into that debate and urge Sri Lanka to take advantage of the good offices of the Commonwealth to help find a way through its problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased the Committee took up the issue of denial of democracy in Burma and, in particular, the possibility of a UN sponsored arms embargo. Earlier this week at a conference in Brisbane, I suggested it was time that the Security Council look at the issue of Burma. Whereas that might be difficult with China, because China is the principal supplier of arms to Burma, the mere fact of that supply of weapons would be on the international agenda and could be a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last issue I have time to mention is Vietnam. Despite the building of relationships&mdash;economic and political&mdash;between Australia and Vietnam, an unsatisfactory human rights situation still exists. I am pleased that has been recognised by the Committee, which is more than can be said of the Australian Government.

It does not take away from what the Committee has done or from this report; it only adds to it. I am very pleased that we had the unanimous support of the Committee for that recommendation in paragraph 6.24. </PARA>

It is interesting to note that a lot of people came to us with information about places all around the world. More and more people came to us as the word spread that we were carrying out our inquiry.

We should be pushing much harder for more independent access to Xanana Gusmao and for an independent assessment of what is going on with his family and his friends and everywhere in East Timor. According to all reports&mdash;the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) told me this earlier today in answer to a question&mdash;there is still a problem in that area. The position is much worse than it has been even in the recent past and we have to look for independent confirmation that things are not as bad as they seem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also mentioned other places, including Bougainville. We have not let the Bougainville Revolutionary Army off the hook.

Nobody is innocent, except the ones who are being hurt&mdash;the ones who belong to neither side and who are just getting in the way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also deal in our report with Burma. We would all agree that that is one of the worst regimes in the world and that abuses in that country have to be stopped so far as that is possible. Austrade still has an office in Burma. We believe that that office should be closed. The Minister said yesterday that it probably will not be. I would like to reiterate now that I believe it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our report we reiterated what was in my motion on China and Tibet of a couple of years ago&mdash;namely, that there should be close cooperation between the Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few brief points about the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A review of Australia's efforts to promote and protect human rights</EMPHASIS>. I believe that this is a very important report. I have not been a member of this Committee, but I think it serves this Parliament and this country exceptionally well. I have not read the report thoroughly, since we received it only around midday today. However, as Senator Bourne said, it is now and will be for some time an excellent source document. For that reason I want to put on record my appreciation of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before making a particular point arising from a couple of the areas discussed in the report, I should say that, in general, as Australians we can be reasonably satisfied with, if not somewhat proud of, the record of our nation. I think the people of Australia are concerned about human rights for people around the world. It has been our experience generally in public life in this country that actions against outrages and abuses of human rights around the world tend to gain support from a fairly wide cross-section of the Australian community. It is commendable that this report contains a chapter relating to the question of human rights compliance in this country and that the areas of Aborigines, juvenile detention, women and refugees are dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although Australia has a good record on human rights&mdash;which of course can be improved, and almost daily in this chamber there is some instance where the need for improvement is pointed to, particularly from these cross benches&mdash;I sound a note of caution. I take a particular interest in a number of the areas, particularly in the region, referred to in this report. About a month ago I rose to give notice of a motion in which I expressed concern that, when a recent delegation of the Joint Committee planned to visit Indonesia, the Indonesian Government refused that delegation access to East Timor. This was at a particularly delicate time. I commend the Committee for the comments at paragraph 6.24, where it criticises the Australian Government for watering down the resolution drafted by the European Community. I support that criticism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I felt that the acceptance by the Government of that refusal to allow the delegation into East Timor may have been one of the reasons why, without adequate explanation, a subsequent human rights delegation going to China, following up its visit there the year before, was refused entry into Tibet. I and others in the Parliament have taken a particular interest in the human rights of people in Tibet. I felt that we might be seeing an instance where Australia might be seen in the region to be a little soft on human rights issues. At the time I expressed the view that, on those grounds, the delegation should not travel to China; it was difficult to see how those human rights issues could be properly investigated if it was not allowed to go into Tibet. I also felt that two in a row was not a good record and meant that Australia might be seen as being a bit of a soft touch in this area. I may be wrong; I hope I am. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt both delegations did their best to obtain the best information they could. I am not questioning that at all. I suppose that eternal vigilance is the price of democracy&mdash;or is it the other way around? I congratulate the Committee on its report but express my concern that Australia might be seen as slackening off, if we are not very careful. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too rise to commend this report and to say that I am a very grateful participant in the activities of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which has submitted this report. I replaced Senator Jo Vallentine on the human rights subcommittee, so I entered this process part way through. It was a most worthwhile and helpful experience to enter Parliament with this kind of opportunity. I think the public hearings, in particular, were very helpful and rewarding in two ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, community groups, who hold very deeply human rights concerns for countries throughout the world, had the opportunity to address the Committee and the Committee was able to show its readiness to listen to and take very seriously the concerns and the evidence that were brought to it. This was extremely positive. Also it was challenging to the Departments and the officials of the bureaucracy who had to be open to scrutiny and accept the probing questioning that they received from time to time about their own involvement in our international relations regarding human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report needs to be commended as a very useful source book. Every member of the Senate will find it useful in that it provides a helpful overview of Australia's efforts worldwide in relation to the promotion and protection of human rights. However, it should be pointed out that the report is not exhaustive. As more and more people became aware of the availability of the opportunity to make submissions, more and more countries' concerns were added. I think we could have gone on. That is why it is a helpful beginning. By the time of the annual review that may be necessary, we will be able to add to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is a very helpful overview. It is a document that, through its appendices, will be enormously useful in a practical way because it shows us at a glance the international covenants to which Australia is a party. But, as the report points out, it is not complete. I would like to support the recommendation, made by Senator Schacht at the National Press Club luncheon today, that we should take very seriously our response as a Federal Parliament to ratify fully these international covenants to which we have become party and to exert our responsibility in a full way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at many areas&mdash;some have been mentioned already such as East Timor, Bougainville and Burma&mdash;this document exposes the double standard that we bear. As has been noted, there is criticism of the Australian Parliament and the way in which we have responded to certain issues&mdash;in particular, to that of East Timor. As Senator Bourne has said, this exposure of our double standards within the document adds to the credibility of the Committee and of the Australian Parliament's willingness to scrutinise our own attempts at being part of the international community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the double standards that have been raised, such as continuation of an Austrade office in Burma and an unwillingness to refuse diplomatic representation to Indonesia and China when we are restricted in our access, are encouragements to be more courageous in our stance, and to demonstrate our willingness to stand up for human rights. We could not afford to do that if we were not already looking at our own compliance with international human rights standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, too, commend chapter 5 on domestic compliance. In particular it relates to Aboriginal people, juvenile justice, women and refugees. As a senator from Western Australia, I would commend appendix 9, which shows a very revealing correspondence between the Human Rights Commissioner and the Premier of Western Australia. Regrettably, there is not sufficient time to draw out parts of this document. I can go no further without adding my thanks to Mrs Margaret Swieringa, the Secretary who has done such a magnificent job.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I welcome this report and congratulate those who have been involved in its preparation. It is very important for the Australian Parliament to focus continually on this question of human rights. What are we here for if it is not to preserve and develop those human rights and to protect them whenever they are threatened?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, to the extent that the Committee has sought to highlight violations of human rights, this report will be most welcomed. The Committee dealt with matters which came before it by way of evidence. Some areas of concern for people in various parts of the world are not contained in this report. I do not suggest that the Committee considers this report to be a totally definitive document on human rights. However, the report contains some very interesting comments. It talks laudably about the universality of human rights and it rejects forthrightly the concept of cultural relativism. Frankly, I believe that is in advance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not share the view of Senator Powell that Australia can really hold its head high on the question of human rights. We are trying to get there and this is one indication of that effort. In our internal policies and sometimes in our external policies we do fail, but I believe that it is important for the Parliament to be ever vigilant to ensure that the Government places the highest priority on the protection and advancement of human rights both within Australia and outside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of human rights is close to the hearts of many Australian citizens. One such person died last week. I attended the funeral of Stan O'Doherty in George Town on Friday of last week. He was born in Belfast. He knew what it was to be discriminated against. He was forthright in his condemnation of human rights violations. Whilst he condemned human rights violations, in a quiet and persevering manner he sought to overcome the problems with which he and others were faced. In recent times he was very forthright in his condemnation of abuses of human rights in Burma and in fact made practical contributions to alleviating the distress of the Burmese people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incidentally, it is interesting to note the UN's report&mdash;and I have the document in my hand&mdash;on human rights violations in Burma. This is a very interesting document, a key document which ought to be studied along with the document that we have before us. Again, I would like to commend the document that we have before us to honourable senators for reading. I am going to study it further and I hope to be able to engage in further debate when the matter comes before us on another occasion.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I refer to page 25 of the report, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Human rights is one of these universal questions. Nation states have no sovereign right to abuse their own people and they should be answerable to the international community for the treatment of their people. Conversely, the international community has a responsibility to assist those who cannot protect themselves. This is not a luxury to be determined by strategic considerations although it is often used in that way. It is a matter of our intrinsic humanity. Law at its best is a noble conception. Applied equally, without fear or favour, it can be a civilising thing which curbs the cruelties of tyrants. International law should reflect the importance we attach to those interdependent and universal values we have identified.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few comments on the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. It is an important report. I have not had the opportunity, as my colleague Senator Harradine has, to read the report and look at it in detail. But my own view is that any institution which seeks to advance the cause of human rights, which seeks to maintain pressure so that people can be protected from oppressive acts, whether by members of their own nation or others, is worth while. I believe that Senator Schacht has shown a strong particular interest in the area of human rights and we have had cause to comment on that from time to time from this side of the chamber. Despite exchanges which may have occurred, I am happy to give credit to Senator Schacht for chairing this Committee and I look forward to reading the report in close detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have two brief views which I want to bring to the attention of the chamber. I am less happy, I suspect, than many others that Australia seems to be opening up wide areas of appeal to foreign courts. One of the oft repeated achievements of the Labor Government was to cut out appeals to the Privy Council. Since then, it seems to me that in a number of areas we have opened up appeals to other courts and other bodies. I believe that often we have been subjecting our people to the judgment of people in courts and tribunals, the appointment of whom we have very little or no say over. I raise a cautionary note there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue I raise is that, certainly from the recommendations I have had a chance to quickly flick through, Senator Schacht and his colleagues on the Committee have recommended that we ratify a large number of treaties. Some of these may well be most worth while; others may not. Certainly I would want to study those carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember&mdash;as would Senator Schacht and I guess a few others who were on the Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures, of which you were also a member, Mr Acting Deputy President&mdash;that it is one thing to ratify a convention and it is another thing to apply it. I think that the history of that particular action on political advertising shows this complexity. I do not raise that in a point-scoring manner but to show that these things are not as simple and as straightforward as they may be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have emerging, in relation to the ILO, issues such as voluntary unionism, the access of people to independent arbitration, and so on. Those issues are going to involve the Australian community for a long time. When we give holus-bolus endorsement to particular conventions, whereas it may well reflect an intention that is desirable and honourable, it can also lead to great complexities. One of the challenges in our system is the interpretation of how these things may be applied in our own community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not raise those two points in such a way as to demean the work of the Committee and Senator Schacht. I am sure that the Committee has pursued its studies and worked with great vigour. However, I do say, on the one hand, that I am less comfortable than others about putting Australians at the mercy of foreign bodies; on the other hand, while the intentions in ratifying treaties may well be worth while, I have some concerns about some of those areas and how they may be applied to our own society. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I wish to make a few brief remarks. When I tabled this morning the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade I incorporated a tabling speech, without speaking to the motion, to save time for Government Business. I respect the fact that this evening other members of the Senate have restricted themselves to five minutes when commenting on the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this is a substantial report&mdash;not just because I am a member of the Committee that compiled it&mdash;which raises many significant issues, including the ones Senator Kemp has raised. I can assure Senator Kemp that those issues were debated very vigorously backwards and forwards within the Committee. They are issues that need wider debate,  and I hope that at a later stage in the Senate's life&mdash;if not this year, then next year&mdash;there can be more time put aside to debate the major issues to which other senators, including Senator Harradine, have referred. I think honourable senators need some days to read and digest the recommendations and to come to grips with the complexities of some of these international issues so that they can debate them more thoroughly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to point out a couple of things about the report. First of all, it was a unanimous report. Thirty members of the Committee, representing all political parties from both chambers, unanimously supported the report. That means that many of us made compromises on particular points to get a unanimous decision. All members of the Committee realised that, as it is the first report on human rights, it would be very unfortunate if there were dissenting reports either way about major recommendations. I am pleased that the members of the Committee were able, after a lot of discussion, to make recommendations that may not be 100 per cent what they believe in but that generally they can all live with in relation to the major thrust of the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the report overwhelmingly commits Australia to a view that it should have dialogue at the international level and in the appropriate forums, either multilaterally or bilaterally, in advancing human rights. As Senator Harradine said, we reject cultural relativism as saying that human rights in one country are different from human rights in another. We believe that there is something absolutely universal about human rights. No matter where we are, nobody likes the idea of being summarily executed, tortured or abused, whether in a Third World country or a First World country. That is a theme of the report that has to be strongly noted. We rejected very strongly the view of cultural relativism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also recognises that Australia will cause irritation in other countries by raising at the international level issues of human rights, but in the long run we believe that it is in Australia's best interests to be consistent in raising those issues with the various countries, even our closest neighbours within the region, with whom we have differences about them. We should not back away and we should be mature enough to be able to handle those issues. We also raise the issue that we ourselves have to come under examination from time to time. We cannot criticise other countries without accepting that they have the right to criticise us and ask us to ratify the various international conventions. That is a debate Senator Kemp and others may wish to have, but that is the basis of our recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I should like to thank the members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade secretariat for their hard work in preparing this report, particularly Margaret Swieringa, the secretary, and Denise Picker, the assistant secretary. This Committee has already adopted a workload way beyond that of most subcommittees or committees in the Australian Parliament, in view of the large number of submissions received.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration)(Charge Percentage) Regulations, as contained in Statutory Rules 1992 No. 288 and made on 1 September 1992 under subsection 20(4) of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992</EMPHASIS>, be disallowed in accordance with paragraph (b) of that subsection.</PARA>
<PARA>These are very important regulations. They were inserted as an attachment to the superannuation legislation that passed through the Parliament in June of this year at the specific request of the Australian Democrats in order to enable the Parliament, if necessary, to disallow the increase in the proportion of wages to be paid by way of superannuation contributions for firms with payrolls in excess of $1m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time, it was the specific intent of those who did the deal that if the economy could not afford such an increase the Parliament ought to be able to disallow it. In other words, it was being said by both parties to that deal that we simply should not automatically proceed with an increase irrespective of the state of the economy. To the extent that that constituted some glimmer of economic enlightenment, it was welcome. Otherwise, both the Government and the Democrats were quite prepared to put in place automatic mechanisms which totally ignored capacity to pay and which, as we well know&mdash;even on the admission of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins)&mdash;put many jobs at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the consequences that has to be lived with when one proceeds with automatic enforcement mechanisms designed to require employers to pay extra money. It is like all other oncosts, whether they are workers compensation charges or anything else, it simply adds to the price of labour and, accordingly, makes it more difficult for employers to afford their existing work force, let alone to employ others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have reached the point where, for the last week or so, we have had some extraordinary grandstanding on the part of the Australian Democrats who, hitherto, I would have thought, would have been very much aware of the total unaffordability of this increase. Indeed, I have challenged Senator Kernot on more than one occasion to table any documentation from any interest group that has been urging her to side with the Government and let this regulation go ahead. I would be very interested to hear any argumentation in support of that proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even at the eleventh hour it is not too late for the Democrats to jump on the jobs bandwagon. It is quite clear that the Government has no intention of backing away, as, indeed, it never did; it was always much more intent on an accord deal which would impose the burden entirely on employers, making us almost unique in the Western world not only in terms of compulsion but also in terms of not requiring any employee contribution. Two countries in the OECD have compulsion but no requirement for an employee contribution. So the prospects of the Government ever seeing reality in that regard have never been alive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great tragedy that to date the Democrats have had to be dragged screaming and yelling from the grandstand. I hope that it is not too late for them to recognise economic reality. Indeed, the way in which they perform tonight will be a good test of their economic literacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As recently as 28 October, Senator Kernot said that the Australian economy could not afford this increase. If one thing ought to be abundantly clear in the economic debate, it is that since that time the economy has gone from bad to worse. The current account deficit is $1.8 billion. Unemployment is 11.3 per cent. Foreign debt in gross terms is over $200 billion, there being a one-off increase of $13 billion in one quarter. It has been an extraordinarily dismal performance. On any measure&mdash;and certainly the test adopted by Senator Kernot when the deal was done&mdash;there is no possible basis on which Australia can afford to put jobs at risk in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be a big challenge. We despair of the Government ever displaying the necessary flexibility or concern for the impact on those who might be at risk in terms of losing jobs. The deal, as we say, has been done. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With something like half of each year's productivity growth being soaked up in paying superannuation, future increases in real earnings will be unavoidably minimal.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that real wages have continued to rise, even in the depths of the recession. In large part, this is due to the failure of those who are reaching agreements to take account of the fall in the domestic rate of inflation. If inflation is less than 2 per cent and wages are running at 4 per cent, there is no possible basis to ever expect that the ACTU will do any more than pay lip service to the proposition of discounts. If what the Government wanted to achieve is for the IRC to take matters into account, that is already in the Act and it is a requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Kernot or the Government want to pretend that somehow we will see wages moderation as a result of an increase in the SGC, I suggest that that is defying not only economic reality but also Australian political history. The fact that the SGC will be rising each year from now until the year 2002 will have virtually no effect on the claims made by the union movement&mdash;and nor has it to date, perfectly understandably and predictably. So it would be not only fatuous but also disingenuous to pretend that somehow any assurance that there might be some wages moderation as a result of the increase is worth the paper that it presumably will not be written on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, this is the moment of truth. It is hard to conceive under what conditions the increase in the SGC would be rejected if the current conditions of the Australian economy do not provide more than enough justification for rejecting this increase.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are talking about the Senate's decision on a Government proposal for an extension of what is already a very important social reform: the extension of superannuation coverage, which significantly enhances Australia's retirement income arrangements and significantly contributes to the very important economic goal of enhanced national savings. This debate is important in three ways. It is important firstly as to the substance of what it can deliver to Australian employees; secondly, as to what it symbolises in terms of the whole debate about superannuation; and, thirdly, as to whether the Parliament is prepared to give recognition to Australian workers for the restraint which they have shown up to this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston asks, `What is the interest group that is pushing for this extension?' There is a very typical Liberal Party approach these days, under Fightback and Dr Hewson&mdash;to say that any group of Australians who want something is a special interest group. We are talking about a special interest group which is 5.8 million Australian wage and salary earners. They are the people who want this increase. They will be the beneficiaries of this. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Alston" NAMEID="LD4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What? They want their jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Alston can dismiss them as an interest group if he wishes. It may not suit him to recognise that they are Australians with a legitimate interest in enhanced retirement income and enhanced national savings. We get this continuation of the ridiculous assertion about the 10,000 jobs at risk. That is an insult to the intelligence of Senator Alston, who is an intelligent senator. It is a pity that he has to fall back on that argument. Senator Alston then trots out the letter from Mr Spicer which I think is in all employer groups' offices around Australia. I have had the same letter read&mdash;with only the date on the top changed&mdash;for the last 25 years, every time anybody has proposed any improvement for any worker in any condition. They just change the signature and the date at the top and say, `Now is not the right time'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about an apparently minor increase. Of course, it cannot be a minor increase for workers if it is going to have that enormous effect on jobs which Senator Alston thinks it will have&mdash;the hundreds of millions of dollars&mdash;but on the face of it it is only an extension from 4 per cent to 5 per cent to some workers at 1 January instead of 1 July. Of course, that is a benefit to those workers. It will enhance their retirement income, particularly for those who are close to retirement, for whom those six months will be a considerable period of their remaining working lives. No-one can pretend that anybody's retirement income will be transferred by one per cent over six months&mdash;that is not the case&mdash;but it is important and it is positive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if the deathbed conversion that Dr Hewson has reported tonight in terms of changing Fightback should by some sad miracle result in the Opposition being elected next year, then what we are talking about is deferring the increase from 4 to 5 per cent for three years until we can defeat the lot opposite, throw them out and start the process of getting a decent retirement income system in place again. They would freeze the rate at whatever it is when they get in. What they want to do is make it 4 per cent, not 5 per cent. So it is much more significant than it appears. It is also significant in terms of symbolism: it symbolises the whole contrast in approaches to superannuation, between compulsion and voluntarism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble with the voluntary approach is that, for all the high-minded rhetoric, there is not a skerrick of evidence in Australian history or around the world that it will work. It is an ideological binge that says, `This is what we think should work. If only people would read the economic textbooks, they would know this is the way it should work'. The trouble is that it never has and it never will. Voluntarism certainly will not and cannot deliver to lower income workers who do not have discretionary income with which to save, irrespective of the incentive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will mean that we have an unfair voluntary system put on top of a very small compulsory system that is not large enough to drive decent retirement incomes for lower income earners. It will make the policy that is proposed by the Opposition even more unfair than it would be if it goes ahead as planned without this regulation being disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, it is important that, notwithstanding the cynical remarks of Senator Alston, we give recognition to the very significant wage restraint that has been shown by the trade union movement and the workers of Australia for the last decade and in particular for the last 12 months or so. The accord partners have given their commitment to work towards wage outcomes consistent with keeping Australia's inflation rate at a level comparable with those of our major trading partners, which we are achieving. On each occasion in the past when those commitments have been made, they have been kept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reason to suspect that this will not be the case. That restraint continues to be shown. Every time it is proposed in recognition of that to have some enhancement of other benefits, to those opposite it is never the right time. They say, `Don't do it now. The workers don't deserve it'. We never get support from the Opposition for any proposal that means enhanced benefits to Australian workers. I accept that from time to time the Democrats get put in the gun because we know the Opposition will never support anything that delivers improved benefits to Australian workers, and it never has. The rhetoric sometimes changes about why, but the Opposition never supports it. It has never supported a wage increase. It has never supported an improvement in wages; it has never supported any increase in working conditions. Each time the Opposition puts forward a proposal it is to cut something away; never to enhance it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has made it clear that we intend to pursue and persist with a policy of wage restraint. The Government has offered the ACTU support for either a modest general wage increase or a $10 increase in minimum award rates targeted at lower paid workers payable from March 1993. The Government has expressed a very clear preference for the second alternative, which would apply to only about one-third of wage and salary earners and which would assist in maintaining low inflation. It would provide special assistance to lower paid workers and an incentive for workers and their unions to participate in productivity-based workplace bargaining. The Government is confident that the ACTU will honour its longstanding commitment to low inflation outcomes, and we will support its preferred option for an increase targeted at lower paid workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Significant wage restraint has been shown, and it is time we gave some recognition to that. As I said, I know that the bogey about the 10,000 jobs will be trotted out. We could have written that already. It was on the cue cards because at the Estimates hearings Senator Alston asked a question with ridiculous assumptions built into it which was designed to get that answer. Treasury came back and said, `The assumptions are ridiculous. We do not think they are in any way reasonable'. But if all those absurd assumptions were to come true, it is true that the outcome Senator Alston predicts might occur. But it is extremely unlikely because the assumptions are so extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many employers are already paying 5 per cent. There are already employers out there&mdash;a large number of good corporate citizens&mdash;who have been contributing this and more for many years, and they are paying tax twice. In effect, they are paying for the superannuation for their own employees and they are paying tax to fund the retirement income of the employees of their competitors who are not doing the right thing. We are saying that it is time that the double jeopardy for those people ceased and that they had to provide only for their own employees. It is time their competitors had to do the same, and it is time that they had to be responsible employers and good corporate citizens as well. It is time we gave some recognition to those good corporate citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know people are concerned about the accumulation of imposts upon employers and they see the dual operation of the superannuation guarantee and the training guarantee as an unreasonable burden. But at the end of the day both are designed in the hope that there will be such compliant behaviour that people will not be paying the levy. In the case of the training guarantee, that is clearly what is happening. In the last financial year for which data is available, which is 1990-91, the level of compliance was so high that only $3m was paid to the Tax Office under the training guarantee levy. Very few people are paying, and it is scarcely an impost at all. It is true that some people want us to look at what training might be funded to comply with the levy requirements, and if that is something that needs to be done in the future we are prepared to look at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us come back to the key issue. It is always the case that the conservatives argue it is never the right time to provide an improvement in living standards or any improvement in working conditions for Australian employees. We are saying that this is a very important social reform. It is important about retirement income, national savings, delivering some recognition to workers for the wage restraint they have given and for going about the process of cooperative change in Australia. Therefore, the regulations should not be disallowed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact of the matter is that real wages growth over the past 10 years has been extremely low. If workers are denied adequate superannuation, obviously there will be a substantial wages claim to compensate for this. Senator Alston and I do not have much control over that, but by linking any increase in superannuation with an agreed upon wages outcome, I assert that business will be better off.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A one per cent SGC increase translates to one-third of one per cent of total wage costs. That, plus a delayed wage claim targeted to only one-third of the work force&mdash;low income earners and those most vulnerable, including many women&mdash;is an excellent outcome. It is a very low aggregate wage outcome. Total labour costs determine employment and unemployment, not one factor in isolation like the SGC, as Senator Alston well knows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question arising from Senator Alston's misrepresentation relates to the impact an SGC increase will have on employment. I will quote from Access Economics' Murphy model, the Opposition's beloved model. The Murphy model has been used to quantify the first year&mdash;the year-one effect of the SGC. It assumes the Alston line of no wage offsets, which we know is an absurd assumption and is untrue. Senator Alston tried this back in June. He talked about 100,000 jobs and 10,000 jobs this time, totally misrepresenting what Treasury said about the assumptions in the model that he asked for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assuming no wage offsets, the Murphy model found that in the first 12 months after the introduction of the superannuation guarantee charge, there would be only a minor impact on jobs. That is even with Senator Alston's assumption. To minimise even that minor impact, it is necessary to recognise that the demand side of the labour market is driven by total labour costs.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Alston *Hansard page B521* asked for an estimate of the employment losses that would flow if the prospective increase in the SGC from 4 per cent to 5 per cent is borne purely as an increase in employers' costs rather than being borne by employees?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The assumption specified in the question is not regarded as realistic. Increasingly in the new wage setting environment wage increases are being determined at the enterprise level. This allows total remuneration for employees to be determined according to the financial capacity of individual enterprises based on a range of factors, including improvements in productivity. In such circumstances it would be unrealistic to assume that real unit labour costs in such enterprises would necessarily increase as a result of an increase in the SGC from 4 to 5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, even in circumstances where wage increases are determined through more centralised arrangements it is reasonable to assume that total labour costs, including wages and superannuation, will be a guiding consideration. Accordingly, the cost of the SGC is likely to be largely, if not fully, offset by lower growth in other forms of remuneration, especially wages. In this regard the Government indicated in the `One Nation' Statement that the scope for wages growth from other sources will necessarily be lower as a result of introducing the SGC than would otherwise be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the unrealistic assumption is made that increasing the SGC from 4 to 5 per cent would be fully reflected in higher real unit labour costs, economic modelling suggests that employment would be about 10,000 lower after two years than would otherwise be the case.

The legislated approach assumes that everybody can pay the higher rates at the same point in time, and this is the cardinal point that both the Australian Democrats and the Labor Party have missed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, of which I am Chairman, carried out an international survey of 23 countries around the world. Interestingly, there were only two countries&mdash;New Zealand and Australia; New Zealand has had a bit of a run tonight from Senator Watson&mdash;which did not have, in any true sense, a properly funded national pension or superannuation fund. That is what this Government has done; it has established a national pension superannuation fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we looked at the international comparisons, we found that the average level of employer contribution in most comparable countries around the world was approximately 11 per cent&mdash;some were more. The average employee contribution was between 4 and 5 per cent. What the Government has proposed here and is phasing in is not, by international comparisons, onerous or unduly harsh or high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting aspects about this increase is that the Government has chosen to phase it in over a period of 10 years. It is a very responsible approach to a serious problem. Many of the countries overseas, such as Germany, France and Italy, introduced measures of this sort when economic circumstances were far worse than they are in this country at present. So the approach is very responsible and it has been aided and assisted by the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Opposition constantly used the terminology `shady deals'. Occasionally, I agree with Senator Kernot&mdash;more often than not we agree than disagree when sitting on our Committee on superannuation&mdash;but I always believe her motives and her principles to be correct. I do not think it does any good to this very important debate to talk about shady deals behind closed doors. It is just not the way it works. The Democrats have accepted this measure as a critical measure to ensure that we have adequate savings for retirement in 30 or 40 years time when the number of persons in the work force will decline rapidly and the number of persons over the age of 65 will double. It is a very important measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand has been mentioned by Senator Watson. Interestingly, after this measure has been effected in Australia, New Zealand will be the only country of the 23 we surveyed which does not have an appropriate tax or funding of its pension system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand does not fund its retirement pension funds. Every government of both political shades&mdash;National and Labor&mdash;before each election has promised increases in pensions, grossly irresponsibly. New Zealand has a very good pension system, with very high levels of benefits, but it is not funded. As a consequence, the National Government, when it was elected 18 months ago, attempted to reduce and restrict the pay-out of its pensions because it cannot continue the ever increasing load on its budget. It is important to look at the New Zealand example and the fact that New Zealand is having to tackle this issue, because it does not fund its pension system, by trying to significantly reduce the pay-outs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other issues related to this measure. The Opposition relies on voluntarism. It argues that if sufficient incentives are provided, people will voluntarily save for their retirement. It does not work. We had great incentives in the tax system prior to 1983 and only 40 per cent of people saved. If the Opposition is elected to government, its policy will be to hold the levy at this level. I do not think it will be elected to government. Should that occur, the administration charges in these funds&mdash;which are flat charges in the main&mdash;will be quite a high proportion of the superannuation guarantee paid into the funds. </PARA>

Returning to the substance of these amendments, I stress again that the Industrial Relations Commission has expertise in awards but not expertise in the area of discrimination while the Sex Discrimination Commissioner has expertise in discrimination but not in awards.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the Opposition has failed to grasp that there are two aspects to the complaints process: the alleged discriminatory act and the possibility of the alleged discriminatory award. If I can go through the process again, a complaint about a discriminatory act under an award can be made to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Secondly, arising out of that initial complaint, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner can follow up the separate issue of a discriminatory award by referring it to the Industrial Relations Commission. As I said, this process seems to be appropriate. The Democrats will therefore not be supporting the Opposition's amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicated to the Committee earlier in the consideration of the Sex Discrimination and other Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 that the object of the Bill is to try to ensure that those discriminatory acts which can be undertaken in accordance with awards are removed from the Australian workplace and employer-employee relationships. It is fair to point out that this legislation, which will apply only to new awards and award variations, will be of a protective and preventative character.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years the Industrial Relations Commission has required parties to address any cases where award provisions discriminate against sections of the work force. A considerable amount has been done to eliminate some types of practices that could be regarded as discriminatory on the grounds of sex. There is no doubt that with enterprise bargaining and the evolution of certified agreements, which are not subject to the same degree of scrutiny by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission as are awards, it has been thought to be very useful to incorporate machinery within the Act so that complaints will be able to be made to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission alleging that a person has been discriminated against under an award or certified agreement, which is captured by the definition of `award'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it appears to the Sex Discrimination Commissioner that the award is discriminatory, the Commissioner must refer the award to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. That would generally be true. The Commission will then convene a hearing to review the award. The Sex Discrimination Commissioner will have standing to appear before the Commission. If the Commission is of the view that the award operates in a discriminatory way, it will be required to take whatever action is necessary to remove the discrimination, unless it considers that a variation would not be in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These sorts of machinery mechanisms&mdash;including a recognition that a certified agreement is made in a way which makes it appropriate that the parties ought to be given a chance to renegotiate the certified agreement before the Industrial Relations Commission moves in a heavy way to remove the discriminatory provision&mdash;are entirely consistent with the attempt to ensure that throughout the employment market in Australia discriminatory provisions that depend on the employee's sex are eliminated. I believe that this provision is very worth while and ought to be supported by the Committee. The Government will reject the Opposition's amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning I was heartened when Senator Lees put some questions to me. I thought it meant that if I was persuasive the Democrats might support us. She has announced tonight that the Democrats will oppose the amendment without hearing my answers, so I do not know whether there is much point in rising. No doubt she will say afterwards that she was not persuaded in any event.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to think that where discriminatory provisions do exist in current awards a party to those awards would seek change. According to current practices, one would expect the Industrial Relations Commission to take account of the desire to remove discriminations and the problem is solved. From what the Minister said, I thought he was in effect agreeing that that would be the case. One therefore has to ask the question:  why do we need the mechanism of a complaint to the Sex Discrimination Commissioner and a further mechanism for the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to appear before the IRC to put a case? That seems to me to be unnecessary. It is quaint having a commissioner in one jurisdiction appearing to argue a case on principle before the Commission in another jurisdiction. Quaint though it might be, what is more important is that it seems to me to be unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why we were not persuaded that these new initiatives the Government has included within the Bill are necessary or, in the sense of having one quasi-judicial officer before another, even desirable. That is why we proposed this amendment to remove them. I do not think we are in a very different position either in spirit or in our objectives. We just doubt that the mechanism the Government has adopted is necessary to achieve the goal it is seeking. </PARA>

If there are provisions in a particular award relating to the carrying and lifting of weights and a certain limit is set to protect women workers, would that be regarded as a discriminatory provision?  I want to know whether a provision in an award which sets a limit in respect of the weights to be lifted by women would be regarded as a discriminatory provision.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An award which restricted the tasks that could be performed by a female by reference to the maximum weight which she should be permitted to lift could appear to the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to be discriminatory. That would allow the matter to be taken to the Industrial Relations Commission, which would itself then make a determination with the benefit of any argument that the Sex Discrimination Commissioner would put.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is an interesting construction but it does not answer the question that I asked. I did not ask whether the provision was discriminatory in the sense that it prevented women from taking particular jobs. That was not the question. In most awards there are a number of provisions, and amongst those are classification provisions which classify the particular areas of work for which particular payments are made pursuant to the award. A particular rate of pay is applicable for those particular classifications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was the whole argument that was adduced when equal pay for work of equal value was being considered in the late 1960s. I was one of the first to obtain equal pay for work of equal value in a particular award. I remember arguing the case before the 1967 or 1969 ACTU Congress when the ACTU executive, of which I was a member at that stage, recommended to the Congress that the policy be equal pay for work of equal value. A section of the Congress proposed that that should be equal pay for equal work&mdash;namely, having to lift the same weights and working under the same conditions in order to qualify for the equal pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Public Service, for example, at that time certain senior filing clerks were getting more than a stenographer. Because of our policy that went through the ACTU Congress, the equal pay for work of equal value meant that in the consideration of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, as it was then, and that of other authorities, the work of a stenographer was of greater value than the work of a senior filing clerk. Therefore the stenographer got more money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am asking the Minister a genuine question because I know that there have been these provisions in a number of instruments that cover workers. I do not want to see this legislation being used to undermine the protection that unions have obtained for their women members. I am very conscious of this&mdash;particularly in regard to shops, for example. It is important that there be some sort of legislative protection which prevents an employer from insisting, for example, that a girl shop assistant, together with another girl shop assistant, lug a roll of lino across the shop. </PARA>

This legislation does not appear to reach into State legislation, but how many awards are there and which ones have such protective provisions which could possibly be affected by this legislation, well-meaning as it is?</PARA>

If one looks at clause 4, Application of Amendments, one sees that subclause (4) provides that the amendments relating to the review of discriminatory awards by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission are to apply to awards and variations to awards made after the commencement of the Act. To that extent it preserves the current provisions, such as there are, that might be of the type which Senator Harradine would describe as protective, but which from another point of view might be regarded as discriminatory.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In discussing the question of discriminatory awards and the industrial relations system, I believe that we should also look at the approach by the unions to this whole question of discrimination. I was minded to do that because of the outburst from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) this afternoon at Question Time about the effect on women of the Opposition's industrial relations policy. The sad thing is that for many years in this country the unions have virtually ignored female workers. There have been some notable exceptions, but if one talks to women in the union movement, one finds general agreement that there has been a most unsatisfactory failure of unions to represent working women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unions have certainly started to take a bit more notice of women lately, which seems to coincide with a drop in union membership generally in the private sector. From the union leadership's point of view, it has been a fairly alarming drop in membership. Women have never been all that enthusiastic about union membership. The compulsion of it may have something to do with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was recently at a conference about discrimination against women and equal employment opportunities in the workplace where the union movement was criticised roundly by both a former industrial relations commissioner for not having taken matters of importance to women before that Commission over the years and the Sex Discrimination Commissioner for not having supported female union members in taking cases before the Sex Discrimination Commissioner. One of the real black marks against the union movement is that so many women have taken cases of various kinds before the Sex Discrimination Commissioner without the support of their unions. It is no wonder that women start to wonder what relevance there is in union membership. This question of discrimination in awards should not surprise anybody when the union movement has been so insensitive or so little attuned to the needs of women in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is also the failure of the Federal Government, which, as we know, has a heavy reliance upon the union movement. Its Ministers and backbenchers are members of unions even to this day. It reflects this blind spot, if you like, towards the working women of Australia. Unfortunately, nearly 400,000 women are not working any more; they are unemployed women of Australia&mdash;women who would be in the paid work force if they possibly could be. There are about 700,000 more women who are either marginally attached to the work force or who fit into other categories, according to the ABS, such as discouraged job seekers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the union mates and the Labor Government have failed women in terms of the workplace. It is interesting that the Lavarch Committee reported in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half Way to Equal</EMPHASIS> on a wide range of issues affecting women. It made recommendations concerning the need for flexibility of working hours and leave provisions in both awards and enterprise bargaining. We have not seen any move by this Government to pick up these recommendations. It has picked up about seven of the 79 recommendations. A number of them related to women in the workplace. All we have here is a fairly esoteric area relating to so-called discriminatory awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one recalls the flourish with which we heard the Government endorse the ILO convention into the needs of workers with family responsibilities, it is interesting to consider its lack of real action in protecting workers with family responsibilities, many of whom are women, in terms of flexibility of hours, flexibility of conditions and opportunities to get workplace contracts which meet their personal needs. These are the sorts of entitlements which will be available to women with the introduction of the Opposition's industrial relations policies. These are the liberating forces which will be available to women once the Opposition wins office. As we saw today in Question Time, the Minister for Industrial Relations tried to take a very misleading swipe at our industrial relations policy as part of what is clearly a campaign by the Government to put fear into the minds of Australian men and women as to the effect of the Opposition's policies on them personally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true to say that the past industrial relations system in this country has not been female friendly. It is quite clear that the record of both the union movement and the Labor Government has not been woman friendly, even family friendly. As I said, we hear a great number of scare stories about how bad a coalition government will be for women. I have been on platforms around this country where members of the Labor Party and their friends in the union movement have tried this scare tactic about how bad our industrial relations policy will be for women workers. We continually hear the cry about vulnerable women and how they will be unable to survive in a new environment. Of course, it is a lot of garbage. I have always maintained that that puts down women and that it denies their natural ability to survive by their skills of negotiation and the skills which they achieve both in the playground&mdash;perhaps through lack of muscle power; they certainly have the power of the tongue&mdash;and in family situations where they have an innate ability to negotiate the competing demands of family members. From my experience, I have no doubt that women will be able to overcome any possibility of discrimination in the workplace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Macdonald is just muttering away there, without giving any attention to the real impact of this procedure. This procedure will allow for complaints to be dealt with in the one proceeding by several persons who are affected by a particular discriminatory action. I think even Senator Macdonald would recall that, in the early 1980s, 34 women had sought employment as steelworkers with Australian Iron and Steel in Wollongong. They had sought employment, they had been denied it, and they brought complaints under the New South Wales Act. The New South Wales Equal Opportunity Tribunal found that the employment practices of the company relating to job vacancies for women, threat of retrenchment and actual retrenchment were discriminatory. This involved the necessary conclusion that not only the individual complainants but also other women in similar circumstances had been discriminated against.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry undertaken was initially restricted to dealing with the individual complaints, presumably because damages, which the complainants were seeking, could not be obtained in a representative complaint. If the representative complaints were to have been pursued and damages sought, individual complaints would have had to be lodged. I mention that case because it is well known to many people. I believe it indicates the worth of a procedure which would allow the complaints to be dealt with in the one proceeding and all the relief sought, including damages, to be granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will maintain our policy in relation to these representative actions.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"`de facto spouse', in relation to a person, includes a person of the same sex as the first-mentioned person who lives with the first-mentioned person on a bona fide domestic basis;".</PARA>
<PARA>In moving this amendment, I refer to proposed section 4A of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1992 which provides for a definition of family responsibilities, which is somewhat widely drawn. As I said in my speech in the second reading debate, the Australian Democrats welcome the provision and believe it is long overdue to ensure that employers cannot discriminate against employees who have family responsibilities and, in particular, may not dismiss them. However, the definition of spouse in the Bill includes a former spouse, a de facto spouse and a former de facto spouse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of that definition, I assume that it also includes de facto spouses where both persons are of the same sex. I checked that with the Minister's office, to be told that that was not the Government's intention and that the amendments were based on ILO convention No. 156 and that that convention did not permit the Government to extend the definition in that way. However, ILO convention No. 156 is not mentioned anywhere in either the Bill or the explanatory memorandum. I have received high level advice from an impeccable source that it is open to the Government, and therefore to me in seeking to amend it, to use ILO convention No. 111 which quite clearly prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, which is interpreted as meaning sexual preference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have moved this amendment because the Democrats recognise that there is a very great need in this area. The community is only too aware of the havoc wreaked by AIDS in our community and of the many occasions where partners are looking after their de facto spouses who are stricken with that disease. If ever there is a situation where such a provision should be used to protect them, to prevent employers from discriminating against them, it is this situation. I therefore commend the amendment to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It needs to be made clear that ILO convention No. 156&mdash;the full title of which is `A Convention Concerning Equal Opportunities and Equal Treatment for Men and Women Workers: Workers with Family Responsibilities'&mdash;which came into effect in March 1991, is mentioned in the second reading speech which accompanied the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Legislation Amendment (No. 2) Bill as the foundation for the provision which has led to the definition which Senator Spindler has referred to concerning family responsibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, our legal advice is that the definition of family in ILO convention No. 156 is unlikely to include same sex partners. Therefore, we believe that we are restricted in our powers to cover same sex partners in legislation based on ILO convention No. 156&mdash;workers with family responsibilities. Further work is being done in these matters. If I heard Senator Spindler correctly, he was mainly concerned about discrimination against those who are living with HIV or AIDS. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but I think Senator Spindler specifically mentioned that as a major concern, and perhaps also the carers of such people. I have not got a definitive legal opinion here, but I think it would be worth reflecting on the Disability Discrimination Bill that we passed through this Senate only a few weeks back which includes AIDS within the definition of disability and also provides that a person who cares for a person with a disability, which would therefore include AIDS, cannot be discriminated against in the terms and conditions of their employment on the basis of their care for the person with a disability. I believe that may give an opportunity for such a person to lodge a complaint with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission if he or she alleges that he or she has been discriminated against. But, basically, we did not believe that the legal basis for the sort of provision which Senator Spindler is moving is available to us on the basis of ILO convention No. 156.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that there is consultation taking place on ILO convention No. 111, which deals with discrimination in employment and occupation, but that at the moment we are not in a position to say that would be a satisfactory basis for the sort of provision which Senator Spindler has moved this evening. The Act in which this amendment is being inserted is the Sex Discrimination Act, which does not cover sexual preference. Sexual preference discrimination in employment is covered by the functions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission under ILO convention No. 111. On determination in employment and occupation, the Commissioner can inquire into an attempt to conciliate on complaints of sexual preference discrimination and can make a report to the Minister. However, sexual preference discrimination is not unlawful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we have to further consider and deliberate upon ILO convention No. 111. Sexual preference was not one of the grounds originally covered by ILO convention No. 111. It was declared an additional ground by Australia under a procedure provided for in the convention, but the Sex Discrimination Act itself does not depend on ILO convention No. 111; nor is that convention a schedule to the Sex Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I do not believe we have sufficient foundation within the ILO conventions to advance the sort of provision which Senator Spindler wishes to insert tonight.

The Minister might correct me if I am wrong, but there appears from the legislation to be no ability to have more than one member on each tribunal. I contrasted this with the provisions in the same Bill in respect of the Immigration Review Tribunal, which can have more than one member. I just wondered what the reason for the difference was.

But the Refugee Review Tribunal member will be one of several such persons or tribunals and no doubt will have discussions from time to time with fellow tribunals&mdash;if that is the expression to use&mdash;about the sorts of cases that present themselves.

The question may well arise at the end of two years as to whether indeed the Refugee Review Tribunal ought to be merged into or subsumed within the Immigration Review Tribunal process. It was thought that the two-year operation of the Refugee Review Tribunal process would be sufficient time to allow that judgment to be made.

In that decision the High Court took the view that the High Court must be the authority to decide whether detention is, in fact, lawful or unlawful as a basis of that section. That provision was strenuously opposed by the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine and Senator Chamarette in May of this year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I must admit that, because of other obligations during the course of the day, I have not had a chance to closely read the decision by the High Court of Australia. If Senator Spindler is seeking to allow the Senate to note that at least a majority of the bench agreed with his prophecy of some months ago in relation to the fate of this section and its constitutional validity, then I am very willing to acknowledge that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the fact is that the decision on that point was to the effect that it is an inherent part of the judicial power that a court be able to exercise its jurisdiction to ensure that a person who is being unlawfully detained should be released. That is a very traditional concept, but a sufficiently narrow one not to have the further implications which would favour supporting Senator Spindler's remarks about the way in which the Federal Court might be given codified powers to replace the more general common law powers that flow from considerations of natural justice and procedural fairness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the decision by the High Court ought to be greeted with proper deference&mdash;I am trying to think of a word which means that I think it is a proper and good decision to ensure that no Executive government can unlawfully detain a person without that person being able to approach a court to seek to be released. That is a good principle to have affirmed by the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before us does not deal with that matter. What it does deal with is, I think, given a lot of support and foundation by the Court's decision in relation to the other major questions before it. For example, Chief Justice Mason agreed and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that authority to detain an alien in custody, when conferred in the context and for the purposes of executive powers to receive, investigate and determine an application by that alien for an entry permit and (after determination) to admit or deport, constitutes an incident of those executive powers and that such limited authority to detain an alien in custody can be conferred upon the Executive without contravening the investment of the judicial power of the Commonwealth in Ch.III courts.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that that well sustains the major policy objective of this statute in regard to detention of those who arrive in Australia without valid entry permits. It allows for them to be detained and held in custody while there is a determination process to investigate the claims that may be made, for example, that refugee status be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst this judgment is very important for delimiting the proper boundaries between the exercise of Executive power and the exercise of judicial power, the exercise of Executive power authorised or affirmed by the Court is really the substance of the policy of this Bill in regard to those who arrive on our shores without proper authority. The question Senator Spindler is raising is not squarely dealt with by this judgment today. As I say, it is a narrow but very important matter of affirming that no court can be ousted from its jurisdiction to determine that no person is held unlawfully in custody in Australia. </PARA>

I agree with him that the facts of Lim v. the Commonwealth are not squarely within the current amendments the Government is seeking to introduce.

I put to the Minister that the very act of imposing a limitation on the court's capacity is very much like telling the court that it may not find in a particular way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a series of questions to do with the detention of unlawful non-citizens. I preface my questions with a comment on the point Senator Spindler put to the Minister. I do not think it is quite correct to say that the High Court's decision in the Lim case is not relevant to the discussion tonight. In clause 54W we talk about detention of unlawful non-citizens and the changing of that detention from being discretionary in the principal Act to mandatory. The principal Act states that an officer `may arrest' and keep in custody a person who is reasonably supposed to be an illegal entrant; that has been changed in this Bill to `must detain' the person.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By agreeing to mandatory imprisonment for people who are under suspicion of being illegal entrants, we are making imprisonment lawful and we are therefore refusing the right of that person to obtain judicial access and to have the lawfulness of that detention reconsidered. We are automatically providing that it is lawful to detain that person when his status is unknown. I want to make that point very clearly. If the Minister disagrees with me, I would be glad to hear his reply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go on to ask a series of questions about the detention of people who are regarded as unlawful non-citizens. I use the example of Indonesian fishermen, who have been fishing off the Australian coast for centuries. They have been arrested and towed into our ports and then detained in various ways in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland. Can the Minister tell me whether this legislation will impose a change of policy in two of those three States&mdash;at present Western Australia does detain in custody. Will the Minister clarify the implications of that part of the legislation on those people?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the sense that the legislation does not make the discrimination, it does matter. There is a considerable cost differential from the previous policy. Western Australia has a far greater cost attached to detention than does the Northern Territory, which actually has the boats in the harbour and the fishermen live on the boats. The system that operates in Queensland is that the boats are not brought in or detained; they are actually towed back. So there will be a considerable cost increase as a result of the increased detention that will operate in the Northern Territory and Queensland. The costs will increase, presumably, to a level a lot closer to that in Western Australia. Who will bear the increased costs of this detention?

Clauses 66, 66A and 66B refer to the detainees being liable for the cost of the detention&mdash;that is, mandatory detention laid down by this Act. We are asking those people, who have no access to the judicial process, to challenge that detention. Are we asking them to be liable for the cost of that detention? In clause 66A we are laying down in the legislation that removed or deported non-citizens should be liable for the costs of removal or deportation, not simply the costs of detention while they are here for maybe three years, but also for the costs of their removal, and in section 66B, the cost of their detained spouses and dependents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was in the process of asking a series of questions before Senator Teague interrupted and caused me to wax a trifle eloquent. I will resume my series of questions. Could the Minister give us some indication of the costs of this imprisonment? He has already answered that by saying that we were intending to try to defray some of the massive costs of this mandatory imprisonment by taking it from people whom we were trying forcibly to repatriate. I believe that the responsibility for the costs of the imprisonment lies fairly and squarely in this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Morally, I do not believe that it is justifiable. I know that may not carry weight at this stage in the debate, but I wonder whether it could not be challenged in some way so that people, who have no say or judicial access but who are mandatorily imprisoned, are then asked to pay for the costs of their imprisonment and for the costs of their deportation. Secondly, what happens to people who are detained in custody for a lengthy period of time and who are then given some kind of recognition in the form of either refugee status or a visa?  What happens to the cost of their detention?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I may have missed the very last part of Senator Chamarette's series of questions, but basically I think one has to keep in mind that under this Bill most of those who are initially detained under the provisions of the Act, as it will become, will be able to apply for a bridging visa and therefore move into the general Australian community. Those who will be unable to do so are a very small group of those who arrive without any lawful authority and are held in custody while their application&mdash;usually for recognition of refugee status&mdash;is considered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One hopes that that determination can be made, at least at the initial level, within a couple of months. Then, if the decision is a negative one, it is up to the person reacting to it to decide whether it merits review or engaging in further processes. One would certainly never want to see the long term or year-after-year detention which has been an unfortunate feature of arrangements in some past and current situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to consider the cost. I am informed that detention at Port Hedland runs at about $35 per day. If that is true, it certainly would not amount to the $50,000 a year which has been mentioned by Senator Chamarette. Even so, for some persons that will be a considerable amount unless they have brought certain resources with them into the country or have them immediately available. In those situations obviously the debt remains, even if the payment is not forthcoming. Such persons will be removed from Australia, still bearing the requirement to pay that lawful debt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could the Minister could give us an estimate of this `small number' who might be detained for a couple of months? The costs of imprisonment are different from the $35 a day that he mentioned and if we charge that amount then we will not defray the actual costs of imprisonment. My final question is this: in the case of somebody who is detained mandatorily and then granted refugee status, what access does he or she have to compensation? Rather than paying the costs of detention, what access do such people have to compensation from us for their mandatory detention?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not see why there should be any compensation. The High Court has said today that it is a lawful, constitutionally grounded procedure for an executive government to detain in custody those who arrive without any lawful authority in order that their claims might be properly assessed, considered and dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that situation I do not believe that any compensation would be required to be paid, either morally or certainly legally. As to the numbers, one can only hazard a guess. But if one is asked the likely number of people who might arrive illegally, by boat or by aircraft, one would have to say that it would probably be in the very low hundreds in any one year, if that. I think it would be most speculative to try to put a figure on it, but it would not be any great number. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Committee. The Cambodians were the plaintiffs in this case. I am very concerned because yesterday the delegate of the Minister notified these plaintiffs, who are in detention in Port Hedland, that they would have to leave the country as soon as possible. It seems rather tragic that the High Court said, as quoted in the AAP report, that parliament had exceeded its powers in prohibiting courts from ordering boat people to be released.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The AAP report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In five judgments, several High Court justices found that some boat people had been detained unlawfully before Parliament passed the controversial laws which were the subject of today's ruling . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me unfair that, due to the Parliament passing legislation in early May, the judge was ordered not to release persons who might appeal. That was the effect of that legislation. It has now been overturned by the High Court. It has been stated by several of the judges that some of those people had been unlawfully detained in custody. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justices Gerard Brennan, William Deane and Daryl Dawson found the provisions the Immigration Department relied on to detain people who arrived illegally by boat before the May legislation were directed at temporary custody, not long-term detention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(Most of the boat people have been in custody for more than two years, some for three years, and some had their boats burned.)</PARA>

<PARA>We can see the catch 22 situation that these Cambodians were in. It was illegal to detain them other than to detain them temporarily. There was a possibility of their shoving offshore, but they could not leave offshore because their boat had been burnt, not by them, but by agencies of the Commonwealth Government. So they were detained for such an extraordinarily long time. I will not go over that, but I appeal to the Minister that these people have now been told that they have to go. As the judgment said, some of them have been here for over three years. If the Minister still has the power under the legislation to allow these people to stay in Australia on humanitarian grounds, I believe that the Minister should, in the interests of justice to these people and in a compassionate manner, exercise this discretion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Minister that it is not setting a precedent. It is not saying that persons have queue-jumped; these people clearly cannot have queue-jumped, because at the time of their departure from Cambodia in 1989, the Australian Government did not recognise the regime in Cambodia. At the time that these Cambodians left Cambodia it was no longer Democratic Kampuchea, which in any event the Australian Government did not recognise; it was called the state of Cambodia. As everybody recalls, it was a Vietnamese controlled government in Phnom Penh, and Australia did not recognise that state. But Australia does now recognise the SNC, the Supreme National Council, and has done so since June 1991. </PARA>

In relation to the Bill before the Committee, I understand it to operate in this way, differently from the current situation: if a person arrives in Australia unlawfully and is detained and makes a claim that he or she should be recognised as a refugee, that matter can be determined. There is then a legal right to appeal to the Refugee Review Tribunal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Are there amendments to this legislation? I think this is a matter that ought to be taken up between now and, if there are amendments, when they are considered by the House of Representatives. This is an important matter, and perhaps there is a way around the problem. I know that the time is late, but perhaps it ought to be considered prior to the matter going before the other chamber. If the legislation goes through as it is at the moment, it is deficient in that it does not enable the Minister so to make a determination. I refer to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regula-tions, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Achieving a balance between refuge and control</EMPHASIS>, points 5.52, 5.53, 5.54 and particularly 5.54.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to DILGEA, the procedures for obtaining stay on discretionary humanitarian grounds are `elaborate' and `in many ways an artificial process'. Those refugee applications eligible for humanitarian discretion are considered both as refugee and potential humanitarian cases. The first level case officer may form a judgment that a case is a humanitarian case and not a refugee case. The case officer can arrange to have the case `fast-tracked', but the person must be refused refugee status, be denied a domestic protection (temporary) entry permit and then proceed to the second tier of decision making to get access to the Minister's discretion.</PARA>
<PARA>These people have proceeded through those procedures, and what the Minister is saying does not appear to me to coincide with what is stated in the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak to the amendments to the Migration Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 in globo so as not to take up the time of the Committee. We have moved these amendments after consultation with a range of groups and after having heard the arguments for and against this legislation by the Department, the Minister and the community groups concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will take honourable senators through the amendments one by one. The first amendment provides for cases where payment for courses may be somewhat difficult for migrants in financial hardship. The clause to which the amendment relates seeks to provide that arrangements can be made for the payment of fees in relation to the charging and recovery of fees for English as a second language courses. It has been suggested to me that hardship provisions or arrangements for the deferment of fees in special cases of hardship are in some way implicit in this legislation. We would suggest and maintain that it is not in any way implicit that there is some provision for deferment, or at least that the Bill includes hardship provisions, if a migrant who is currently engaged in ESL training is unable to meet payment of the $250 fee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bring to the attention of the Committee that this fee which will be imposed by clause 4A will be imposed on people who are currently engaged in English language courses, not migrants who will come to Australia in future; they will have another schedule of fees to contend with. This fee of $250 applies to those people currently engaged in English language training. There may well be people currently engaged in English language training who will find it difficult to find the $250. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we would like to submit to the Government and the Opposition that a hardship provision needs to be included to ensure that those people who cannot meet the immediate payment of that $250 on enrolment, which is what the clause says, can use some sort of deferred payment mechanism or at least have their hardship difficulties taken into account in the payment of the fee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment relates to clause 4B. We believe it is an important amendment, given that much of the funding for these courses will be tendered by DEET. The amendment is simply to ensure that those who are teaching English language to adult migrants are in fact qualified to do so. We think this is certainly an important measure to ensure that the quality in the teaching of English to migrants is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the implementation of the export education legislation last year, we saw that there were tremendous problems. In fact, quite a lot of shonky providers ripped off the taxpayer and overseas students with courses in English which did not meet quality control standards, and were prepared to abscond with funds. I am sure that DEET will ensure that quality control mechanisms are in place in the tendering process. Those mechanisms have not yet been outlined to us. Certainly, not a great deal of detail was given to the Senate Committee this morning when we asked questions of officials that related to the evaluation and control of tendered courses. We submit that it is a reasonable expectation that people who teach English to migrants should have the appropriate qualifications to teach that language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third amendment relates to this very thorny question of the 510 hours of tuition. Perhaps the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), who represents the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), is able to provide some detail of, or at least put on the record here in the chamber, some of the undertakings that the Minister, Mr Hand, has given to me personally and, I believe, to community groups through his representative, Mr Laurie Ferguson, at a public meeting 10 days ago. The Minister has said that funding for English language courses in respect of this 510 hours of tuition will be rolled over for other students if a particular student acquires functional English before the 510 hours have expired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have raised this issue before. The whole concept of this 510 hours worth of English language training is a very thorny one. As I said yesterday in my speech during the second reading debate, it has no educational basis whatsoever. It seems to have been reached on the basis of a number of surveys which showed that people could acquire functional English after something like 370 hours. But certainly those involved in teaching English as a second language to migrants have found that, in many cases, 510 hours is inadequate and that many more hours are needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we asked questions about this issue this morning in the Senate Committee hearing&mdash;it was not a public hearing; it was an informal hearing&mdash;the question was put to DILGEA officials about people who reach the 510 hours and who still do not have functional English. It seems that they just simply fall out of the system, unless they are going to be job seekers and end up on a DEET program which is targeted towards job seekers. Clearly, many women who may not end up in the job market&mdash;who may be at home looking after children or who may not even be seeking paid work&mdash;could possibly be very disadvantaged by this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told this morning that what happens to people after this 510 hours has expired is a `question for the future'. The Minister, Mr Hand, needs to look very closely at this question to ensure that people are not falling through the gaps and are not receiving 510 hours worth of tuition which, for all utilitarian purposes, is not adequate to meet the needs of these migrants. It is certainly a conundrum that is yet to be resolved. This question of the rolling over of the funds or the hours for students who may need more than 510 hours tuition is not resolved by this legislation. We would like to see some provision which would ensure that the funding of students who do not need their full quota of 510 hours is rolled over to other students. But as I said, nowhere in this Bill is that issue addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told this morning that the matter is a question of policy. That may well be, but is not this whole legislation a question of policy? I submit to the Government that if it is the Minister's intention to roll over this funding for other students then there should be some legislative effect to that. I ask the Minister in the chamber, firstly, to tell the chamber whether it is correct that the hours will be rolled over to other students; and, secondly, to tell us how the Department or the Minister plans to give some kind of legislative effect to that undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth issue relates to registration and the commencement of courses within three and 12 months respectively. I have also spoken to Mr Hand about this issue. He accepted that a small number of migrants&mdash;perhaps 10 per cent, which is the figure that has been bandied around in a lot of circles&mdash;would perhaps be unable to register within three months of arrival and commence their tuition within 12 months of their arrival because of various hardship circumstances. For example, a woman might be raising a family or a migrant might be simply too traumatised to register. There could be a whole range of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister indicated that regulations relating to circumstances of hardship would be made under the regulatory power provided for in clause 4D(3)(b). We certainly support that. In a sense, our amendment is an attempt to at least symbolically give effect to the Minister's undertaking that regulations would be made for hardship provisions. I ask the Minister to confirm to the chamber that it is the Minister's intention to make these regulations for provisions of hardship, and to tell us when those regulations may be forthcoming. We will be waiting for those regulations to appear so that we can give them close scrutiny. I accept that the Minister, Mr Hand, has given us the undertaking that those regulations will be made, and I accept that he will do that. However, as I said, this amendment simply seeks to give some indication to the Minister from this chamber that we certainly expect him to draft the said regulations for hardship provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those few words, I commend the regulations to the chamber. As I said in my opening remarks, we have looked at these issues very closely. We have not accepted all the arguments put to us by the various lobby groups. We have looked at each of these issues very carefully. I put it to the chamber, and certainly to the Opposition, that these are not unreasonable amendments. If the Government is not prepared to accept them, will the Minister at the table address here some of the concerns that I have raised by way of questions and these amendments, and put on the record some of those undertakings that the Minister has given publicly&mdash;certainly through his representative, Mr Laurie Ferguson&mdash;about the rolling over of those hours and the fact that hardship provisions will be provided for in the regulations in relation to the registration and enrolment of students?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not seek to detain honourable senators, so I will refer to these four amendments very briefly. Of course we interpret the words, `provide that fees are payable on enrolment in the English course', as allowing for administrators to make deferred payment arrangements. That is the case in all other legislation that I know of, and I do not see why it ought not be administratively allowable here. There is no need to complicate the matter with regard to the proposed amendment. As to the second amendment, I of course wish to see the very best qualified teachers involved in English language tuition for adult migrants, but I am opposed to credentialism per se, and I am opposed to our tying ourselves to State definitions. I believe that on merit the very best teachers should be available for these courses. Of course, nobody who is not able to teach the courses ought to be employed. I do not believe that we need the second amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third amendment is an attempt to enforce on the Minister an ability that he administratively has anyway; that is, that the administrator can go beyond the minimum guarantee or obligation that is set out in this legislation for the very first time, but it is put in a different form of words. To build out what is not intended in the legislation is, I believe, to take from what should be administratively in the hands of the Minister to make a statutory obligation. The Opposition does not support that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth amendment is rather tautological because the Minister has the power to bear in mind circumstances of hardship. Let me name my colleagues who want the Minister to take situations of hardship flexibly into account. Senator Crane, Senator Walters, Senator Calvert, Senator Tierney and other Opposition senators&mdash;and I will include myself on the list&mdash;have had careful discussions in recent days to ensure that there is a provision in this Bill that will allow for flexibility in enrolment in circumstances of need such as a mother with young children who, for quite practical reasons, might not be able to begin a course of English language tuition after 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very fact that we have paragraph 4D(3)(b) satisfies the Opposition that it is perfectly possible for the Minister to set out regulations. The reason why I am speaking before the Minister is to re-enforce the call which I have already initiated. When we deferred these two Bills yesterday to be considered later than the other four in the package, I spoke and referred to this clause. I believe that the Minister will set out regulations to give flexibility to this matter. Therefore, these words are not necessary. In fact, they may even be read down to limit the full prescription power of the Minister. For these very sound reasons, the Opposition does not support the Democrats' four amendments. But let it be very clear: we are looking to the Government to be flexible, to be humane, to be reasonable in the administration of this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have heard some pretty long bows drawn in this chamber but to suggest that the cultural transformation of Australia into a multicultural society would be affected by the requirement that fees be payable on enrolment in an English course seems to me to be somewhat absurd. When one considers that that is in the context of a provision which provides for exemptions for the holders of a health care card or registered job seekers, one can see that already in that provision there is recognition of the fact that some people currently within Australia who want to enrol or re-enrol in these courses will not even be able to find the $250 which is required.

They may, in order to achieve that, have their own internal rules as to the qualifications of those who should teach. We do not believe we should go into that detail. Our obligation is with the service providers. At least their obligation to us is to fulfil their contractual arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the third matter, it is important to keep reiterating that the great social reform to be carried out by this Bill is to entitle those who arrive in Australia as migrants or refugees or who are currently in the community, to 510 hours of tuition in the English language at the expense of the Australian community. That is a very generous response by the Australian community to the need of such people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so far as a person may attain proficiency within 400 hours or 370 hours, which is the average at the moment, a notional surplus of hours might be available that would otherwise be funded for that person. My belief is that that surplus ought to be redistributed to enable others to come into the course rather than to add to the entitled hours of any particular person. Therefore, the Government does not believe that it should move from its present very generous provision on the part of the Australian people. If a person requires more than 510 hours to attain English proficiency, there are other schemes available within the TAFE systems and so on to enable that to be undertaken, and funding is provided. In fact, there is a very significant increase in funding altogether to enable that English teaching to occur. </PARA>

However, one can assume that, in prescribing the situations which might have an effect that would acknowledge that it was unreasonable for an obligation to cease in regard to the provision of English tuition, regard will be had to the arguments put forward by Senator Sowada and others. The Government does not accept any of these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I was affirming was that the legal obligation being untaken by the Australian community as a result of the passage of this Bill into law will be to provide 510 hours of tuition, unless proficiency to a certain level is attained earlier. It seems that what Senator Sowada is saying is that if proficiency is attained earlier by a large number of people, then a funding amount ought to be made available in a way which perhaps adds up to 600 or 700 hours of tuition to those who have not attained a certain proficiency at the end of the 510 hours.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is the way I look at it and I believe that that is a fairer and better way to enable a greater number of people to have earlier access to the provision of this tuition than would otherwise be the case. </PARA>

After careful consideration of this measure and the reasons for which this legislation was seen to be necessary, the Opposition supports the Bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Minister makes a decision under subsection (1), the Minister must cause notice of the making of the decision to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the day on which the decision was made.</PARA>
<PARA>In circumstances where the Minister is uniquely powerful to make a decision to ban a person or persons from entering Australia and where that decision is not reviewable, of course the details of that decision must be given to the Parliament. But I ask for one step more&mdash;not a statutory step but an informal and, I believe, bona fide arrangement. If there is public controversy or even controversy that comes to the ears of a section of the Parliament, I ask that the Minister of the day openly explain to the shadow Minister of the day all the reasons that led to the ban on the person or persons; and that it not be left until even 15 sitting days before that explanation is laid on the table of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is any hiding behind this new legislation by a government of the day in banning persons not welcome by that government, if there is any censorship, any exclusion of freedom of speech, any political decision making carried out under the guise of this legislation, it would not be in the spirit in which we are passing it tonight.

If Senator Teague is saying that once the decision is taken&mdash;given the fact that some 15 sitting days hence, the decision is to be laid before the Parliament subject to scrutiny and no doubt the need for justification if it is raised as an issue in the Parliament&mdash;it might be appropriate for the Minister to give a preview to the shadow Minister, then that could probably be undertaken. I cannot give an undertaking on the part of the Minister; I certainly will convey that request to him.

I thank Senator Tate for taking that matter on board and for putting it to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand). The Opposition regards this as a reasonable preview given after the decision has been made to the appropriate shadow Minister so that a bona fide decision is made on behalf of all Australians and made in light of the fact that the explanation, when eventually given to Parliament, will be acceptable to the Parliament. It would, of course, be made by the Minister with the view that he would be a representative of the Parliament. So it is in the latter sense in which I make the appeal.

I am forced into making these comments because I believe that the Committee has not been given the full information that it really deserved. I may not have correctly heard what the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) was saying. It was also the case that I had not turned up the paragraphs&mdash;which I was desperately looking for&mdash;that I wanted to outline to the Minister from the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the committee stage on one of the other Bills I asked a question about the exercise by the Minister of a discretion to grant permanent entry to the Cambodians who are under threat of forcible deportation and whose case was so clearly correct before the High Court. I ask the Minister whether the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) had a discretionary power to grant permanent residence to those persons on humanitarian grounds. I have now found the paragraph in the report of the Joint Select Committee. It is paragraph 6.27. It applies to both illegal entrants and border claimants. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additional processing measures were announced by the Minister on 12 February 1992. These are outlined at paragraph 6.31. The new procedures are intended to allow complete processing of applications from border claimants and arrested illegal entrants within two months.</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraphs 6.27 to 6.43 make it perfectly clear in my mind that the Minister does have the ability to exercise discretion on humanitarian grounds. Paragraph 6.43 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After the RSRC's consideration of the review application, a senior delegate of the Minister, who is the review authority in the processing scheme, makes the final decision on whether the applicant is a refugee and whether to grant a domestic protection (temporary) entry permit. The delegate bases his or her decision on the RSRC's recommendation and the applicant's comments on the findings of the RSRC. The delegate's decision is documented and forwarded to the applicant.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what happened in the Cambodian case. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While this is generally the final point of the process, the Minister may consider granting entry on humanitarian grounds under the Minister's section 115 discretionary powers.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the report of the Joint Committee says. I may have misunderstood the Minister's response. I believe it is important, prior to this motion being put, for the Committee to be fully aware of that situation. I ask the Minister whether he would kindly clarify that situation. Is the Joint Standing Committee correct in what it has said and does the Minister have discretion? If he has discretion&mdash;it is intended to give him discretion under the new system from 1 July 1993&mdash;why cannot this measure be amended now?</PARA>

There was no gag and there was no guillotine. As I understand it, the question was put. I was not aware that Senator Harradine wished to speak. The Chair obviously was not aware. If Senator Harradine had risen in his place, he would have been permitted to continue.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Revised Procedures</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.25<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 26 June 1990, the Government established an Interdepartmental Working Group to develop a streamlined refugee determination model which would ensure the speedy settlement of on-shore refugee status claims. The new procedures, which were announced by the Minister on 26 October 1990 and which came into effect on 10 December 1990, included 3 stages:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.a primary stage for applications to be assessed and decisions taken quickly on the grant of refugee status;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.a review stage, consisting of an examination of negative assessment by the RSRC and a determination by a senior delegate who is the review authority in the scheme; and</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.26<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DILGEA advised that this working group model was expected to cost the Commonwealth approximately $1.83 million per 1,000 applications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.27<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additional processing measures were announced by the Minister on 12 February 1992. These are outlined at paragraph 6.31. The new procedures are intended to allow complete processing of applications from border claimants and arrested illegal entrants within 2 months. For other on-shore refugee claimants it is intended that the procedures will provide a six month process for the primary stage, and three months for the review stage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Primary decision stage: 10 December 1990 to February 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.28<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the processing arrangements in place between 10 December 1990 and February 1992, at least 10 separate procedural steps were undertaken before a refugee application was submitted for a primary decision. These steps included the following:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.receipt of application and checking against the departmental data base;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.a registration check, involving the input of the applicant's details on the departmental data base, creation of a separate file for each applicant, acknowledgment of the application, and circulation of the application to UNHCR;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.referral of assessment to the applicant and UNHCR for comment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.29<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the initial version of the processing system, applicants and the UNHCR were given 21 days to comment on a negative assessment by the case officer. When comments were received, they may have necessitated further investigation by the case officer. When such further investigation was</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">completed, the case officer prepared a submission to the Delegate, documenting the case officer's findings, any comments from the applicant or UNHCR, and the case officer's recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.30<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final step of the primary decision stage prior to February 1992 was the decision by the delegate, made on the basis of the case officer's assessment and the comments by the applicant and UNHCR on that assessment. The delegate documented his or her findings. In the case of a negative assessment, a statement of reasons was prepared for the applicant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Primary decision stage: from February 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.31<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new refugee determination procedures announced by the Minister on 12 February 1992, the primary decision stage has been streamlined. There is no longer a separation between the case officer and primary decision delegate. As noted by DILGEA in evidence to the Committee, from February 1992 the person who interviews the claimant is also the person responsible for assessing and deciding on the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.32<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Decision makers at the primary stage are to be at the administrative officer class 6 level. They are to receive extensive training in law, case management and positive interview techniques. These case officers are supervised closely by senior managers who mentor and monitor their decision making.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.33<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary decision stage is crucial in refugee processing. In the present system, the case officer is the only person to see and evaluate the applicant. The case officer's assessment is relied upon by decision makers at the current review stage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.34<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his February 1992 announcement, the Minister also foreshadowed a package of regulations intended to give greater control over the primary decision stage of refugee processing. These include:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.imposing binding time limits on the period after arrival in Australia when applications for refugee status must be lodged;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.imposing binding time limits on responses to correspondence and lodgement of review applications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.requiring applicants to advance all details relevant to a claim at the application stage;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.restricting repeat applications; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.requiring accurate details of change of address for the purpose of serving directions and correspondence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.35<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed regulation requiring applicants to advance all details at the application stage represents a modification of the previous application and natural justice consultation arrangements. The primary level natural justice provisions included extensive consultations with applicants. Experience showed that this extended the investigation stage, delaying decision making, as applicants provided more and more case details on each consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.36<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All applicants now will be interviewed. The interview provides the occasion for ascertaining case details, and assessing case merits and the credibility of the applicant. Under the announced arrangements, the application and assessment procedures are joined. As DILGEA noted:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It brings the process from application. . . and assessment to decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.37<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Applicants will be given the opportunity at the interview and afterwards to respond to adverse material. This is in accordance with natural justice principles. Regulations will set down time limits for responding to adverse material and lodging review applications. DILGEA informed the Committee that the model which has been adopted can be flexible. DILGEA noted that if the applicant needs further time to get evidence to satisfy an interviewing officer on some point, the processing mechanisms could be `stalled while better information is sought and a better judgement established'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.38<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new arrangements, the processing of border claimants and illegal entrants in detention is to be expedited considerably. As noted by the Minister, increased efficiency will derive from a changed approach. Instead of waiting for claimants to lodge lengthy and comprehensive applications, DILGEA is to actively investigate refugee claims. In this regard, it is worth noting that recent long delays in processing Cambodian border claimants occurred because of delays in lodging their refugee applications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.39<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new procedures for border claimants and detained illegal entrants include:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.scheduling a claimant for interview with a DORS official within days of the border claimant or detained illegal indicating an intention to apply for refugee status;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.requiring the claimant to fill out a brief one page statement that he/she wishes to apply for refugee status, rather than requiring the usual multi-page form to be completed;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.exploring all aspects of the refugee claim at the interview; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.providing applicants with a statement of reasons for negative decisions and a specified time in which to apply for review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.40<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the introduction of these measures, DILGEA told the Committee:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the essential difference in procedure is that we will allow persons who are in the community. . . to come to us with the written details of their claims. For border claimants, we will go to  them  and  interview them  to extract  the claims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Review stage since 10 December 1990</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.41<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the review system which has been in place since 10 December 1990, but which is to be replaced as of 1 July 1993, an applicant who has been notified of a primary decision denying him or her refugee status has 28 days within which to apply to the RSRC for review of the refusal decision. The RSRC is comprised of one representative each from DILGEA (Chair), Attorney-General's and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as one community representative nominated by RCOA. In addition, an UNHCR representative attends in an advisory capacity. The departmental representatives on the RSRC are all senior officers within their respective departments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.42<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As at May 1992, the following steps were involved in the review of an application by the RSRC:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.an application for review is received and a registration check is carried out;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.a submission to the delegate is prepared by the RSRC, documenting the RSRC's recommendation and the applicant's comments; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.in the case of a negative recommendation for refugee status, the RSRC can make a recommendation direct to the Minister for granting entry on humanitarian grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.43<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the RSRC's consideration of the review application, a senior delegate of the Minister, who is the review authority in the processing scheme, makes the final decision on whether the applicant is a refugee and whether to grant a domestic protection (temporary) entry permit. The delegate bases his or her decision on the RSRC's recommendation and the applicant's comments on the findings of the RSRC. The delegate's decision is documented and forwarded to the applicant. While this is generally the final point of the process, the Minister may consider granting entry on humanitarian grounds under the Minister's section 115 discretionary powers.</PARA>

Tonight we find that the Minister is unable to confirm those discussions and the issues that were raised and is unable to put on the record the undertakings that were given that secured our support.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With Christmas coming up, I am worried that parents may buy unsafe helmets for their children due to the laxity of Standards Australia's certification and testing procedures, which the Federal Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) is apparently prepared to help cover up. As the article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Choice </EMPHASIS>notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a product carrying the Standards Mark will not necessarily be the safest or most efficient choice. Nor will it necessarily be the best performer.</PARA>
<PARA>That certification mark is meant to signify the highest standard of quality and safety. Consumers may be misled into believing that products bearing the standards mark are the safest and best. Mrs Bailey has previously called on the Minister for Consumer Affairs to initiate an inquiry into Standards Australia because of concerns about bicycle helmets that had failed testing procedures but had been accredited by Standards Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About a fortnight ago, the Government refused to allow Mrs Bailey leave to table in the House of Representatives the entire 5 August 1992 Technisearch report, which I have now tabled here. It clearly states that many bicycle helmets failed safety testing, were allowed to be modified by manufacturers and were never recalled. For four months, the Minister for Consumer Affairs has had a copy of the 5 August 1992 Technisearch report, which states quite clearly that not only has the helmet Mrs Bailey named in Parliament failed safety testing, but also that many other models of helmets have failed safety testing, some around ventilation openings and others which split open when tested in wet conditions; that manufacturers were permitted to modify their products to eliminate faults and no helmets were recalled; that many models of helmets on the Australian market failed testing and that the problems were widespread; and that, in practice, this has meant that helmets remain in circulation which could be expected to fail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was in a report the Minister claimed supported her view that the helmet in question raised by Mrs Bailey `stood up to testing under normal, reasonable conditions'. If that report had been quoted in full by the Minister instead of selectively, all those concerns would have been revealed, thus confirming Mrs Bailey's concern. Given that it is now compulsory for all cyclists to wear a helmet and that Christmas is fast approaching and parents are looking for presents for their children, a report which raises serious questions about the safety of helmets on the Australian market should have been investigated immediately. Unfortunately, the Minister's lack of action on this issue is denying parents their right to know this information so that they can make decisions to protect the safety of their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some questions that must be answered, particularly in the context of the article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Choice</EMPHASIS> magazine, which is put out by the Australian Consumers Association. I ask: which are the helmets that failed safety testing and are still out in the community being worn by cyclists? Are those helmets still available for sale on the Australian market?  Do those helmets carry the Standards Australia certification mark of quality and safety? Why were manufacturers not required to recall those helmets that failed testing?  Why have Australian consumers not been notified of these risks to their safety?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to pay tribute to one of Tasmania's honorary citizens. Last weekend, Mr Tsuneichi Fujii, the head of the great Japanese company Fujii-Koeri, died at the age of 81 after a long illness. Mr Fujii took the Tasmanian superfine wool industry onto the world stage and over two decades formed a close relationship with Tasmania. His work promoted not just the Tasmanian wool industry but the State he came to love. In his many visits he formed lasting relationships which went beyond the boundaries of business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Fujii first came to Tasmania in 1972. His enthusiasm for Tasmania began from this time. Every year since then Mr Fujii, accompanied by his entourage of around 80 people, would visit my home town of Launceston for the annual wool sales. Frequently, his company would bring its own film crew to make films promoting the place where the world's best extra fine wool is grown. Not infrequently, such filming found its way onto Japanese television. The northern Tasmania superfine wool industry owes its survival to this man. From 1973 onwards, Mr Fujii again and again made headlines throughout the world's textile markets for his unmatched series of world record prices paid for Tasmanian wool. In 1989, Mr Fujii's son Kenroku, the company's executive director, stunned the world when he paid 300,850c a kilogram for a 100 kilogram bale of wool from Connorville property at Cressy. This price was 10 times higher than the previous highest price paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Fujii is reputed to have once told a meeting of growers in Launceston that in Japan the company's motto is `No. 1&mdash;the highest quality'. He continued to say, `Where the Fujii garments are marketed, so is Tasmania'. Tasmania was publicised in Japan through the Fujiis' manufacture of high quality fabrics produced from the superfine wool purchased from the Launceston wool sales. The Fujii company stressed the importance of retaining the Launceston wool sales after discussions were held concerning the possible centralisation of the Australian wool sales. The Fujiis emphasised that such a decision could put an end to the payment of record prices for the Tasmanian product by the textile manufacturer Fujii-Keori Ltd as the superfine quality of our wool would be lost amongst the mainland clip. The Fujii company has stressed the importance of the `bought in Launceston' cachet attached to the wool, as the wool is considered throughout the textile and fashion industries to be a guarantee of the very highest quality. The business community of Launceston was grateful for this support and its annual wool sales are still probably Launceston's biggest single trading event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Fujii had a love for Tasmania. This love was recognised in 1982 when Mr Fujii became Launceston's first honorary citizen. In 1984 he was made an honorary representative for Tasmania in Osaka. In that year alone he spent more than $1m promoting the State. More recently Mr Fujii was appointed an honorary member of the Order of Australia. His love extended to his making a substantial donation to the Tasmanian Government, which resulted in the establishment of the Tsuneichi Fujii Fellowship Trust. This Trust, administered by the Tasmanian Premier's Department and Cabinet, was set up to promote goodwill between Tasmania and Japan. Annual awards are made available for</PARA>
<PARA>educational, cultural, scientific, trade and business exchanges between Tasmania and Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years numerous Tasmanians have had the pleasure of being awarded this prize. The most recent award was won by a Mrs Anna Stewart, a senior teacher at Flinders Island District High School. The award will allow her to produce a range of educational materials for Tasmanians visiting Japan and Japanese visiting Tasmania. Mr Tsuneichi Fujii is survived by his wife. To her and the rest of the family I extend my condolences on behalf of the people of Tasmania because, with the death of Mr Fujii, Tasmania has indeed lost a friend.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obligations arising from the provisions of Section 30 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 are the responsibility of the relevant action Minister or Department.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1a) Yes. As a result of the consideration of feasible and prudent alternatives, it was decided to grant leases imposing strict conditions relating to the protection of the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1b) There is no prudent and feasible alternative site. The Commonwealth is not in a position to provide access to alternative equivalent sites.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1c) It is likely that adverse effects will occur in the lease areas should mining take place. However, stringent lease conditions have been imposed to minimise these adverse effects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No. The Additional Information was made available for public comment from 2-16 January 1990 and the proponent's response addressing issues raised during this period of public review was incorporated in the Department's Assessment Report of February 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) A satisfactory EIS is one which has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The agreement between the Commonwealth and the companies specifies that, should the companies decide to proceed beyond exploration stage, an Environmental Management Plan will be prepared for each lease area. The exact scope and requirements of the Environmental Management Plan has not yet been determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Heritage Commission did advise that is `extremely concerned that the proposed Environmental Management Plan involves consideration of each lease in isolation of the impacts on the larger area'. If it becomes necessary for any or all of the Environmental Management Plans to be prepared, their scope will not necessarily be restricted to actions and impacts within the particular lease area and the concerns of the Australian Heritage Commission in the preparation of each Environmental Management Plan will be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The process by which a decision whether or not to nominate an area of Australia to the World Heritage list is made has recently been formalised in the Inter-Governmental Agreement on the Environment. Under the terms of this Agreement the Commonwealth will consult the relevant State before placing an area on the indicative list of possible World Heritage nominations. This is the first step in considering a nomination. During consultations with Queensland the question of nominating Shoalwater Bay has not arisen. At this stage it is by no means clear that Shoalwater Bay meets the stringent criteria laid down for World Heritage listing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) No. The provisions of both the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 and the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 have been complied with and a decision has been taken to issue leases. An inquiry under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 would, therefore, serve no useful purpose.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Vietnam's tax system has been in rapid evolution. Published information on the tax system suggests that Vietnam does not have a comprehensive, settled tax law. Moreover, business reports suggest Vietnam's tax arrangements may vary across different projects. The tax system may well be subject to further change as Vietnam's economy grows and as the Vietnamese Government reduces its direct controls of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Australia's trade with Vietnam is unlikely to be affected by the latter's current `unlisted country' status under Australia's tax law. Listing as a comparable-tax country may be relevant, at the margin, to Australian direct investment in Vietnam. If Vietnam remains unlisted, profits earned by branches of Australian companies established there, and dividends paid to Australian companies from their Vietnamese subsidiaries, are taxable under Australia's Foreign Tax Credit System which provides credit for tax paid in Vietnam. It would not be appropriate to exempt all such Vietnamese source income from Australian company tax (as would occur if Vietnam was listed) until it can be clearly established that Vietnam is a comparable-tax jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to emphasise that if Vietnam remains unlisted, most Australian companies that have established subsidiaries there, or intend to do so, would not be subject to accruals taxation (at the Australian company tax rate) under the controlled foreign company regime. This is because those companies are virtually all engaged in active businesses, and would qualify for the active income exemption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Government has received a number of submissions from taxpayers requesting that Vietnam be added to the list of comparable-tax jurisdictions. It is currently reviewing Vietnam's status.</PARA>
