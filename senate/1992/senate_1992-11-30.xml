<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I ask: given the fact that there are nearly one million Australians unemployed, that our foreign debt stands at $180 billion and that Australia today recorded its worst balance of payments figures for almost three years, how does he justify the failure of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industrial Relations to condemn the mass industrial action which will only further harm Australia's economic prospects?</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly one would need something like that in Victoria. In so far as the national stoppage is concerned, I notice that Mr Bob Carr, the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, has described it as something which is not in the national interest. I agree with that and I believe that Senator Cook and the Prime Minister also agree with that. The fact remains that this so-called national day of action has taken place largely due to events in Victoria; where a government was elected on the basis that it would do certain things, including ensure that the standard of living and wages of the average Victorian worker would not be lowered as a result. It is not in the national interest that a government breaks that promise within two or three weeks of being elected to office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret the national day of action having taken place but, of course, one has to look at the causes of it. It is all very well for those opposite to huff and puff about it from the Opposition benches. The fact is that industrial disputes in this country are about half what they were under the coalition's former Government. Before the coalition went out of office we had a national day of action about every fortnight because the former Government had no wages policy and was quite incapable of managing industrial relations in this country&mdash;just as those opposite would be if ever elected again.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I note that the Minister endorses part of what Mr Carr said in that he agrees that the strike is not in the national interest. But why will the Prime Minister not therefore go the extra step called for by Mr Carr; that is, to call off this blatantly political strike? Is not this yet another definition of national leadership by the Prime Minister&mdash;that he will encourage mass industrial action for some short term, perceived political gain?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a good news question&mdash;good news for the economy and good news for micro-economic reform in Australia. This morning I attended with the Prime Minister at Mascot Airport when he, metaphorically, turned the first sod in the development of the third runway at Sydney Airport. It was an important ceremony which marked the beginning of the construction of greater capacity at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. This is very important because  Sydney Airport is the main aviation hub for Australia, the main point of entry from overseas, and the main point of intersection for a lot of air travel in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sydney Airport has a forecast of demand which runs at very high figures into the next century. This development enables the facility of the airport to be upgraded to meet that demand. That demand will take account of the tourist boom which we are experiencing and which will grow further. It will provide openings for business and will create employment in Sydney and New South Wales. It will particularly help country commuter traffic in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government decided to go ahead with this project in March 1989. We confirmed that in November 1991, following the receipt of the environmental impact statement which, as I have said before in this chamber, was one of the most comprehensive environmental impact statements ever undertaken in Australia. This project will create 200 jobs on average per year in direct employment and a further 200 jobs in the wider Sydney community will depend on those jobs at the coalface of airport construction. When the third runway is completed some 13,000 other jobs will be created in the operation of the expanded airport facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This airport, with all of its importance, is part of an overall airport upgrading program. The developer is the Federal Airports Corporation which, in this decade, is spending $2.8 billion on improving the infrastructure of Australian airports. The sum of $1.6 billion has immediately been approved and when that money finds its way into the community it will create several thousand new jobs. Of that $1.6 billion, $650m has already been spent; another $300m will be spent this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important day for the improvement of airline facilities in Australia, involving the upgrading of our main point of entry, our ability to capture the international tourist market and our ability to provide efficient and safe facilities for air travel in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Industrial Relations to the Keating-Kelty-Halfpenny political strike which is designed to further damage the Australian economy for blatant, short term political considerations of the Prime Minister and to protect the power and privileges of a few big union leaders.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am amazed at the Opposition's one dimensional view of reality. It would add some statesmanship and perspective to those opposite if they could actually see things in the whole, not with one eye closed against the truth. There is no doubt that this national day of action&mdash;I should be careful about the words I use, because those opposite want to make it appear to be a national strike when, clearly, it is not&mdash;has been provoked by the actions of the Kennett Victorian Government.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But the Opposition here, in not recognising this reality, in fact propounds the fiction that this is somehow or other simply a union matter. It is not. It is a question of the rights and protections of ordinary Australians at work. That is fundamentally what it is about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are proud that in this country we have evolved a system of arbitration whereby, by resort to independent assessment&mdash;after an argument has been put by unions on behalf of workers, after an argument has been put by employers on behalf of employers and after these arguments have been independently assessed against the criteria of justice, equity and the substantial merits of the case&mdash;a decision is made and an award comes forward which guarantees for Australians minimum protections and standards in the workplace. It guarantees them protections on wages, working conditions and their rights in employment, including in dismissal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Mr Kennett has done is set that almost century-long tradition on its head. He has denied people access to fundamental award protection. It is, to me, absolutely unbelievable that one should think that, when people are denied access to their basic entitlement and overnight have their basic entitlement unilaterally reduced, they would not take action to protect themselves. But, if they do, they are branded somehow or other as traitorous. I do not support the stoppage but I certainly understand why it is that people, many of whom have never taken industrial action in their lives, are forced to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cite to the chamber the example of a nurse, who is a dedicated and idealistic worker who is not in there for avaricious return. Under the Kennett legislation, that nurse will lose 25 per cent of his or her income&mdash;a reduction in household expenditure of 25 per cent. No wonder there has been a reaction.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I ask the Minister: what is the difference between a national day of action and a strike? Is this not just Labor double-speak? Does the Minister agree with the New South Wales Opposition Leader, Mr Carr, who said that the Federal Labor Party must take responsibility for high unemployment which would make this the `bleakest Christmas since the Depression'?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two questions here and in the short time allowed me I will try to do justice to both, but I make that caveat in respect of the time available to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the first question, the ACTU, as I understand it, has called for a national day of action which will take the form, in most places, of meetings of protest, and nothing more than that, and work will not be disrupted significantly. But this will be an expression of protest. I know those opposite want to make it out to be a strike so that they can say that the strike has failed. It essentially will be a protest, but in some areas there will be strike action. That is the definitional difference; I thank Senator Parer for his question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not agree with Bob Carr if what Bob Carr was saying is that industrial relations in Australia have been a contributing factor to the level of unemployment. They have not. The best indicator of that is to look at the inflation rate. There is no wages pressure in the economy to push up inflation and the inflation rate is below the average of the OECD and the lowest rate in Australia for over 25 years. That is the surest indication that our wages policy works, not like the wages policy of those opposite.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The September quarter rise means that profits have risen 37 per cent over the past year and are 67 per cent above the recession trough. Senator Hill asks from what sort of base. Let me deal with that part of the answer, which I propose to give straight away. Even in 1991-92, the worst years of the recession, the profit share at 14.1 per cent was above the level reached in each of the years of the last Liberal Government when the average was 12.6 per cent. So when we talk about&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not matter. We are talking about a percentage profit share. The honourable senator asked the question and will have to cop the answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the improvement in company profits is widespread and across most industry groups. The recovery in profits is a positive sign for employment, because improving profits boosts a return to investment and is, thereby, an encouragement for improved employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is very vocal about this issue. Those opposite would take $6 billion to $7 billion out of the Budget and put the recovery at risk. Mr Rob Ferguson, Managing Director of BT Australia and the 1992 banker of the year, is reported to have said that reductions in Government spending would reduce company earnings and delay the recovery. That comment is relevant to the policy of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, some of the increase in profits has been due to reduced interest rates. On the first six occasions that this Government implemented reductions in interest rates, they were opposed by the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson. The Opposition's policy of changing the Reserve Bank charter to make inflation the only target would increase interest rates and reduce profits and investment. The structurally sound profit share that this Government's policies created is the reason why employment grew strongly out of the last recession and the reason why it will improve as we come out of this recession.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> mentioned by Senator Kernot. I give priority to the Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> in my daily reading of the media. In so far as the headline and the tenor of the question are concerned, they misrepresent or misunderstand the whole nature of the project. This was not some cynical exercise to take people off the CES list&mdash;that could be properly criticised. It was an exercise to take up the willingness of local government throughout Australia to participate in an attempt to generate national recovery by ensuring that activity was undertaken in local government districts with high unemployment in a way which generated the economy and the flow of money around the community, with job consequences and, in some cases, the direct employment of those who were unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the 13,000 jobs which were to be involved at an average of six months each during the course of this program, the idea was that in many instances those who had part time employment with council gangs or who were working with subcontractors who would be taken on by councils using this scheme would have their employment secured or would be among the extra people taken on by the subcontractors in order to undertake the work. In these ways the 13,000 jobs which will be sustained, secured and in some cases created by this expenditure of money will certainly improve economic activity in the districts concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know from going around many areas in Tasmania&mdash;the north-west, the south; right across the State&mdash;the local councils are very appreciative of the opportunity to receive this assistance, which enables work to be undertaken which could not be supported by ratepayers alone or through other sources of funding available to those local government areas. In so far as they have secured employment and undertaken economic activity in those municipalities, I believe that the program has been worth while and continues to have benefit for the local government areas concerned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Government has a clear perspective of its role in leading workplace reform and change in Australia. One of the most important elements of that change, with an increasing work force made up of women, is to balance family responsibilities with the demands of work. It was for that reason that in March 1990 we adopted the International Labour Organisation convention on work and family responsibilities. It is for that reason that we have set up in my Department, the Department of Industrial Relations, a work and family unit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The five research projects referred to in this question are research projects whereby particular Australian companies, and in one case the New South Wales Employers Federation, have agreed to develop programs which will highlight the flexibilities needed in the Australian workplace for workers with family responsibilities to balance the demands of both their families and their careers and future employment prospects. Because, in sociological terms, most women seem to be the primary care givers in the family, it is specifically a policy that helps women pursue a career while taking their family work seriously and responsibly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to ensure a safety net and a series of proper and fair protections for workers, we have an independent authority, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, which makes awards and which, as I said in an earlier answer today, guarantees basic protections for Australian workers as to their rights. That award system is also flexible enough to negotiate a spread of hours working at different times during the day and to be adapted in ways in which family responsibilities and work can be merged.</PARA>

A number of leading Australian companies got recognition under those awards.

Although the recent peace accord in Mozambique has brought hope for the five million Mozambicans severely affected by 10 years of civil war, the combined effects of war and drought have created a situation where, unhappily, mass starvation is a real possibility.

It comes on top of the $8 1/2m that we have contributed since the beginning of the year to help the millions of people in desperate need in Somalia, which is also being supplemented by our contribution to the UN military operation there. It comes on top of Australian relief worth more than $15m for the Horn of Africa&mdash;that is, Sudan and other countries&mdash;announced on 10 November and the Government's continuing program of long term development assistance to Africa, which currently stands at $110m over three years.</PARA>

In that respect, in fairness, it has to be acknowledged that the Opposition's plans to slash $209m from the aid program would savagely cut our capacity to respond in this way, particularly, as it has already indicated, with bilateral aid programs to Africa, with a resulting detrimental effect both on assistance to Africa in its present plight and to that continent's sustainable long term development.</PARA>

Back in November at the Premiers Conference, I think it was in Perth, the leaders of all Australian jurisdictions took a united stand in relation to firearm control measures. This will not strike any fear into the hearts of Australian politicians because, quite irrespective of political allegiance or whichever States and Territories the Premiers and Chief Ministers come from, they were united in saying that in Australia we should have a philosophy which certainly puts the community and its safety as a priority of paramount concern and that we have a perfect right to regulate the use and possession of firearms in the community, in particular the sale of those military style semi-automatics which featured in some of the massacres which Senator Spindler no doubt had in mind.</PARA>

The measures taken by all jurisdictions to ban the sale of these military style semi-automatics, supported by all political parties from whatever part of Australia they come, at the highest political level of the Premiers Conference, means that we will not be intimidated by this attempt by some United States lobbyist to change our culture and the move in Australia to ensure that we are not a gun-ridden society when it comes to violence and reaching for a weapon in order to solve a problem.

Therefore, at the moment I am not persuaded that the political effort would be worth while to try to encourage the States to, for example, have a central repository in various suburbs and towns for these weapons.

One of the elements of that reform, one of the important structural changes on the Australian waterfront, was the change from the pool system of employment, whereby all waterfront labour was in a pool and hired as needed by companies, to a direct employment system which was underpinned by a universal award to set basic standards and conditions of fairness and then within which enterprise agreements were reached.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each port in Australia where waterside labour is now engaged directly by companies has completed an EBA&mdash;an enterprise based agreement&mdash;in which management and those employees, protected by the safety net of the award, have worked out the most efficient way of delivering waterfront services in those ports. Hence, it is because of those changes, or in part affected by those changes, that we now have internationally competitive loading rates at Australian ports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last report of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority I indicated that, on average across Australia, the loading rates of containers per Australian port per hour is now at an internationally competitive level.

Can the Minister inform the Senate of details of the granting by the private security industry of a national award to the Australian Protective Service, a government agency within the Justice portfolio?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most honourable senators will be aware of the work of the Australian Protective Service, not only around Parliament House but also in the major airports where we travel, where, of course, it has a first response counter-terrorist role. But it is also involved in many other duties, including at residences such as those of the Governor-General and the Prime Minister; and in sensitive locations around Australia, such as the Australian-US facilities at Pine Gap and Nurrungar.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many situations where its services are used to great effect. It was therefore very pleasing that the Australian Protective Service was awarded the security Australia annual achievement award for being the most outstanding security organisation in Australia in 1992. I understand that Mr John Mackay, the Director of the APS, received that award at an industry function last Thursday night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this demonstrates that this Government's commercialisation program, which of course the APS has been working within over the last several years, has enabled that organisation to develop a commercial edge and practices that make it as efficient as any private security firm. But it has also retained that high professionalism which is very necessary to ensure that it properly discharges its duty of protecting many vital government organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe, for example, to sell off the Australian Protective Service&mdash;which I understand is one of the proposals under Fightback&mdash;would be to lose the advantage of a body which has peculiar and very sensitive obligations to protect and to guard installations of high national significance.

Quite clearly, this program has the support of, and I believe was actually an initiative of, the various local government municipalities throughout Australia which wanted to participate in the revival and rejuvenation of economic activity in their municipalities. Expenditure has been undertaken which will enable some 13,000 people to benefit from the injection of funding into local government, so that the work gangs or subcontractors can be secure in their employment or may take on persons into those subcontracting organisations which provide services and undertake tasks on behalf of local government.</PARA></TALK.START>

But if one had a look at Byron Bay, one would probably find that those involved, particularly any part time workers on council gangs, would be very grateful to have had their employment secured and sustained during this time. What is more, the people of Byron Bay will have some good urban infrastructure as a result of the implementation of this program. Overall, I think it is an excellent program which will bring benefits to local government districts and help sustain employment within local government gangs and for subcontractors.

<PARA>Today's balance of payments figures for October showing a further deficit of $1.8 billion in Australia's current account deficit in one month are nothing short of disastrous. They are disastrous not just because of the overall magnitude of the figure, horrendous though that is, but also because of its composition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result has occurred following an 11 per cent fall in exports and a minor fall of 4 per cent in imports, which is largely explained by changes in civil aircraft imports. This deficit comes at a time when Australia is still in the deepest recession it has had in its postwar history&mdash;I notice that the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) does not even show the Senate the courtesy of staying to listen to this debate or to participate in this discussion&mdash;at a time when our unemployment rate is the highest in postwar history, at a time when nothing short of 30,000 bankruptcies have occurred in this country in the last two years alone, and at a time when, as a result of today's balance of payments deficit, there has been a further escalation in our foreign debt to the tune of another $1.8 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, we have a debt to the rest of the world, a foreign debt, of approximately $190,000m in gross terms, and a net debt in excess of $150,000m. That is a figure that compares with about $25,000m when this Government came to office almost 10 years ago. The policies of this Government over the last 10 years, year by year, month by month and day by day, have put this nation and all Australians in debt to the rest of the world. That is a legacy that we will leave future generations, particularly our immediate generation&mdash;our children and, beyond that, our grandchildren. That is a legacy that no other generation in Australia has ever left to its children and grandchildren. It is a legacy that will cause great hardship in terms of living standards for this nation for decades to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the Government do about this?  What did Senator Button say today when asked, `What policies are you going to adopt to change the situation'? He said, `If we have no policies, we will announce them at an appropriate time'.

<PARA>I very briefly want to note that Senator Button referred to this as a national stoppage which, of course, it is. I notice that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) referred to it as not a stoppage, and argued why it was not a stoppage; he said it was, in fact, simply a day of action&mdash;or, perhaps more appropriately, a day of inaction. It would be nice if the Government could get its act together on what really its attitude is to whatever today has turned out to be. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The waterfront, the Achilles heel of Australian exports, will be on strike. Our coalmining industry, our largest exporter which sells $7 billion worth of exports overseas to oversupplied world markets, will be on strike. Some 200,000 metalworkers in that beleaguered industry, which is desperately trying to increase productivity, will be on strike, notwithstanding the comments made by the Chamber of Manufactures, which has stated quite categorically that what is needed in Australia today is flexibility within the industrial relations system while maintaining minimum standards. It says that forcing employers and employees to involve unions is not the way to go. It says: let them have a choice. That is what the Jobsback policy is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the sorts of things that these people engineering the strike out of Melbourne are revolting about. I ask the question: all for what? The answer is simply because, when it is all boiled down, the trade union movement desperately seeks to hang on to power over little people and will not accept that, in the area of micro-economic reform, there is an urgent imperative to reform our outdated, ramshackle industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real concern of the ACTU sheltered workshop is that, with voluntary unionism and genuine enterprise or workplace agreements, it will have to work to retain or obtain members. It will have to convince Australians that there are benefits in paying substantial union dues. I suppose it is understandable as its record over the past 20 years has been that of destroying the very jobs for those whom it was supposed to protect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will this strike achieve? It will be a lose-lose result. I know the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) commonly talks about a win-win result. This will be a lose-lose result. About a quarter of a million workers will lose a day's pay. Companies will lose production. There will be no exports out of Australia today. All exports out of Australia today have been stopped. Companies will still be required to pay interest to financial institutions and pay the rent and other fixed costs. The Government will lose taxation revenue. More importantly, productivity measured on a unit cost of production basis will decline. This is all because of the macho antics of a clique in the ACTU which, hand in hand with its political servants in the Labor Party, is responsible for our massive level of unemployment&mdash;the highest it has been in 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government itself has moved towards enterprise-based agreement, but it has done so in a manner which entrenches its union leader mates. An enterprise-based agreement cannot be recognised under this Government without the imprimatur of a registered union. That is the basic difference. Genuine enterprise-based agreements and voluntary unionism are the reason for this anti-Australian display we are witnessing today. The people who have engineered this strike are traitors to Australia's desperately needed recovery. They will not recognise that the vast majority of private sector employees already work under a free system. They are hell-bent on coercing that majority against their will to become part of the rigid centralised structure which puts enormous power of economic life and death in the hands of a few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister, Senator Cook, was quoted at the weekend as saying that the industrial action could place our international reputation as a reliable supplier in jeopardy, but he had no plans to avert the strike. Words without action are dead&mdash;a very old saying with a lot of truth in it. All suppliers to our export markets, with ships in port or arriving, are required under their contracts to advise their customers of this strike. That is the real nature of exports in the competitive world in which we live. Another nail is driven into the coffin of reliability. In that respect, Minister Cook is absolutely correct: in a world where commodity demand is at best subdued, another reason is given for our overseas customers to divert supply to our competitors. We hear today of the balance of payments figure, that the current account deficit for the month is a record for the past three years, yet these people have no regard for the consequences on their fellow human beings, their fellow Australians; they are interested only in themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The embarrassing part is that customers overseas have to be given a reason for strikes&mdash;why a ship is delayed, why a ship may not be able to come into port tomorrow, the next day or next week as a result of this strike today. The question I have to ask is: what on earth does the exporter say that he has not said over the years which is different in a valiant effort to retain his customers? Another little bit of the market disappears, a few more jobs are lost, all because of the short-sighted use of industrial muscle aided and abetted by the Labor Government&mdash;the political arm of the trade union movement&mdash;and all because of a big and protected union which will not accept the fact that, like every group in our society, to survive it must be competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the Labor Government doing about it? Absolutely nothing. It is doing nothing because it is locked into supporting and entrenching a small and powerful interest group which not only pays enormous amounts of other people's money into Labor Party coffers but also determines who gets preselected and becomes the leader of the party, the Prime Minister. All this is determined by the trade union movement. This strike has all the stench of yet another deal between an elected government or supposedly elected government and the unelected power brokers of the ACTU. It is about time that the people of Australia realised just how insidious and destructive is this relationship between a government and a handful of power brokers. Every time this issue or the question of union funding of the Labor Party is raised, anyone who raises it is accused of union-bashing. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The President of the ACTU has drawn a parallel between the 1890s and the 1990s. It is scandalous, scaremongering stuff. In the 1890s people were prevented from joining trade unions. The coalition is saying that in the 1990s individual Australians should have a choice: the freedom to join or not to join an organisation, whether that organisation be a union or a professional organisation. That freedom of choice does not exist in Australia today where there are union-controlled closed shops. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is this the sort of attitude we should tolerate at a time when not only the wool industry, but also the whole of Australia is in trouble? There are no jobs and there is a desperate need to be more competitive. We should be not only exporting more, but also producing more of the goods in Australia which Australians want to buy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently Gazel Enterprises worked out an agreement to the satisfaction of the workers and the company. This agreement was rejected by none other than Anna Booth, who was then told to go back to Melbourne by the employees, who all promptly resigned from the union. The examples go on and on. One can go back to Mudginberri, Dollar Sweets, Metway Bank, Power Brewing and so on. In every case, employees have emerged with a better deal; a deal which is in their interests and in all cases has meant higher real wages and the removal of restrictive work practices which has substantially increased productivity and, hence, job security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unions, and thus the Labor Government, apparently cannot tolerate job security and increased real wages because it means they lose relevance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On our side, we argue that it is best achieved by working with Australians to create reform and progress, not against them&mdash;going to the workplace and creating a framework of cooperation; and the generation of higher productivity and sharing the rewards of that higher productivity fairly among the workers who helped generate it, among the shareholders who own the company and among the clients who buy the goods and services from that company. It is an ethic of cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, we have the confrontationist approach of the Opposition. The problem for Opposition members is that they are ideologically blinkered: they hate trade unions, although they pretend otherwise. Their rhetoric, as we just heard in the serving that we just received, is all anti-union propaganda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing here is to recognise that unions exist in Australian society as an institution because about 43 or 46 per cent of the Australian work force want them to. It is a sensible approach by a government to harness the positive and constructive sentiments within the union movement to achieve reform; not to approach the issue of reform from the point of view that one must first destroy this institution before one can move to a new system of change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can certainly move to a new system of change if one wishes to do that. Jeff Kennett has proved that. If nothing else, Jeff Kennett has returned Australia to the days of industrial conflict and confrontation that were wreaked on this country in the period of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inescapable fact is that, for the comparable period, industrial disputation in Australia under Labor is 62 per cent below the level of industrial disputation under the Fraser Government. The inescapable fact in Victoria is that, under Labor in that State, industrial disputation was off the bottom of the graph of the Australian Bureau of Statistics; it was at the lowest level since statistics were recorded in the history of the Bureau. That is the record for Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comparing Victoria, a partly industrialised State, to the other major industrialised State, New South Wales&mdash;if one were to make the comparison of a Liberal governed State to a Labor governed State&mdash;New South Wales was well above the national average for industrial disputation  and,  in  its confrontationist  ap-</PARA>
<PARA>proach with its so-called reforms last year, pushed the national average up by inciting disputation and provoking strikes; whereas Victoria was well below the national average. That is a comparison of who manages industrial relations in this country better. Confrontation is the Liberal way and disputation the outcome. Cooperation through working together is the Labor way and the outcome is a reduction in disputation and an increase in industrial harmony. That is the issue here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue here is a move by the Opposition in this place to shift the blame and responsibility. It has no perception of the fundamentals of cause and effect. What is the cause? I have just given some statistics to show the effects of better management compared with the effects of poor management. Before I go to the cause and effect element, we do not welcome a national day of protest, which will mostly be a day of protest meetings carrying resolutions and of discussing the Victorian legislation but in some places&mdash;particularly in Victoria&mdash;will be a day of industrial action. We do not welcome that. But it is idle then to blame the effect as if the effect of actions taken is the cause of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the cause in this case is the Kennett Government in Victoria, and the uncomfortable and unpalatable truth for the Opposition is that the Kennett Government is a forerunner of what the Opposition would do were it ever to take the treasury bench in this Federal Parliament. The unpalatable fact is that the actions of Jeff Kennett are the blueprint of John Howard and John Hewson. The unpalatable fact is that the cat is out of the bag before the Opposition has been able to spring its ploy of soft language and cajoling on the Australian people without revealing the true dimensions of the industrial relations horror it wishes to visit upon this economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have given the figures on strikes as a comparison. We have been successfully increasing cooperative industrial practice in Australian workplaces at the enterprise level. Our best practice program is aimed at Australian companies, management and workers identifying which companies in the world in their area of competition perform the best and developing a corporate plan to bridge the gap and put Australia in front. They are working together to be more competitive. Under our best practice program, the companies that have entered and been selected&mdash;selected not by the Government but by a commercial board headed by John Prescott, the General Manager of BHP Australia&mdash;are predominantly in Victoria, if one looks at the State by State distribution. The sad reality of the events in Victoria is that an industrial cooperation ethic was emerging in that State, a new industrial relations culture was mushrooming, and along came the bull in the china shop, Jeff Kennett, who is now threatening to sweep away the attitudinal change and the change in workplace custom that we were developing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is easy for governments in Canberra to pass laws, it is relatively simple for governments in Canberra to proclaim regu-lations, but the mark of a true government with real leadership is to change the human attitudes of people in the work force&mdash;to move them from one way of seeing the world to a more cooperative and positive way of seeing the world. We were evolving that attitudinal change, and elsewhere in Australia we are evolving it by practical, hands-on example. Many companies such as Sheraton Hotels, Asta Aviation, Olympic Tyres, Dulux Paints, Bendix Mintex&mdash;I can keep going on&mdash;were developing that positive attitudinal change of creating higher productivity with the certain knowledge that the outcome of that higher productivity is shared fairly with all sides and is not pocketed by one side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along comes Jeff Kennett. It requires us to pause here for a minute and look at the facts of the ascendancy of Kennett in Victoria. I think it is fair and reasonable to observe that most Victorians did not vote for Kennett but voted obviously against the Labor Government in Victoria. However, they have moved from the frying pan into the fire. If one looks at all of the exit poll surveys, most people would have preferred anyone but Kennett. But, in the circumstances, that is who they got.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the next development. Before the election, what did Mr Kennett promise? He promised that `no-one would be worse off by a single cent'. That is a direct quote; that is what he promised. After the election, what did he do? He immediately removed, by legislative fiat, holiday leave loading and weekend penalty rates to guarantee that his promise&mdash;only days old&mdash;was broken immediately, and he and his Liberal Government in Victoria misled the community that had voted for it. Do not take my word for that; take the word of John Howard and take the word of Peter Reith. Both those people&mdash;in leadership positions in the Opposition&mdash;said, on the public record on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program and on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS>, that Kennett had misled the Victorian voter. So Kennett remains condemned by his own side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us move to the next important development. The Victorian Government brought down an economic statement which exacted a poll tax on Victorians. It meant that the pensioner in Coburg paid exactly the same amount on property as the wealthy landowner in Toorak, on the grounds that this was somehow fair: it is flat tax; everyone pays the same. At the same time as the Victorian Government did that&mdash;not taxing according to means, but taxing flatly, according to where it could get the money&mdash;in the dead of night, without the press in attendance, it put through Victorian Parliament a Bill which increased the salaries of members of parliament; in the case of the Industrial Relations Minister, by $8,000 per annum, when he was already $14,000 per annum ahead of the salary of a Federal Minister. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what Jeff Kennett has done to nurses. Nurses are hardly an example of workers in Australia noted for trying to use industrial muscle to improve their income. A nurse is a worker in Australia widely recognised by Australians as dedicated to her or his profession. Because  nurses are 24 hours a day, seven days a week workers, if the advantages of weekend penalty rates and shift loadings are taken off them, as Jeff Kennett has done, by our calculations it will decrease their salary by 25 per cent. It will cut their income by a quarter. </PARA>

It is an ideological obsession. We have an approach, despite the economic difficulties, of trying to bring harmony and a sense of national purpose and unity to the community, and then of trying to tackle our industrial problems as one Australia. That was the nature of our statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A nurse in Victoria now loses 25 per cent of her or his income.

It has made it impossible for that nurse or any other worker who feels aggrieved under that system to have access to independent arbitration&mdash;an Australian institution since the beginning of the Australian Federation, an institution of free independent arbitration based on equity, justice and the substantial merits of the case. The Victorian Government has denied them access to that, so they cannot go anywhere and resolve their grievance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think what we are doing here is debating an urgency motion. The urgency motion contains a number of assertions and also some things which we are asked to consider. There is no doubt that we can agree with some of the content of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the last part of the urgency motion, we read that the action that is being taken today `will only further damage the economy and lessen the chances of Australia's one million unemployed finding jobs'. I can but agree with that part of the assertion that the action today will adversely affect Australia's economy. One would have to be a fool to suggest otherwise. The action today will reduce productivity because products will not be produced today. It will reduce profitability. It will cost this country money and it will cost us our reputation internationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There should be nobody in this place or anywhere in Australia who can be satisfied that this turn of events has come about. In fact, nobody is accepting the sole responsibility for today's occurrences. All groups involved are madly thrashing about, madly trying to lay the blame on another group&mdash;any group except themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that none of this bickering and blame laying is of any benefit to the huge number of Australians who are unemployed at the moment. We would all be much better off if we saved all this bickering&mdash;let it cease entirely&mdash;and all parties involved sought to become cooperatively involved in employment creation projects. That is a blithe statement that many people could make quite cheaply, and it is reflective of the sort of endorsement that we have&mdash;everybody is interested in job creation programs and jobs&mdash;but when we come to commitment that is the real test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had criticism in Question Time of the sorts of temporary, space-filling jobs that are involved in the local government initiatives that are now taking place. That is not the sort of employment creation project that we should be creatively attending to. The sort of employment creation that we ought to be seeking is the long lasting, economically beneficial&mdash;when I say that, I mean the sorts of benefits which accrue to the nation rather than to individuals&mdash;employment creation programs which are sustainable in the long term. In order to do that, we need the Government's leadership, intervention and acceptance of its responsibility to recognise initiatives which have the potential to create the sort of employment that I have just described. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as though we have to look very far for it. We know about the orbital engine and the gene shears and the sagas attached to them; we know about Memtec and its inability to attract the sort of intervention that I have just mentioned; and we know about solar cells and their associated technology&mdash;the ridiculous spectacle of seeing a fine Australian development needing to be developed further in Switzerland and carted around on a foreign test bed before it could prove in Australia that we are at the forefront of the development of viable, compact and economically attractive solar energy cells. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about inventive developments which have not been given the support necessary, both government and financial, for their development and full productive fruition in Australia for Australia's benefit.

The proposal would require quite a low level of government responsibility to be recognised&mdash;something less than $1m. It would see a recycling plant established in Tasmania, employing people in collecting, processing and redistributing this oil, all saving money and resources for Australia. This would result in a lessening of those very figures which alarm us today&mdash;the escalation of our overseas debt and the continued expansion of our unemployment figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very figures that concern us so much today are being ignored by the deliverance of this Government's policies. The Government deserves criticism for its failure to endorse, support and intervene on behalf of such projects. We have a bipartisan recognition of the market as being the sole determinant of the success of such ventures. Instead of the Government accepting the responsibility to intervene and recognise technological development, what do we have? An abrogation of responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned in this place last week the success of the Barrett family near Ballarat, which had an enterprise that utilised a previously wasted material&mdash;pig manure.

But here we have an enterprise which has now utilised this waste material and produced methane and then electricity from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have too many examples of wasted resources throughout Australia, especially manure. It is quite a joke. I see that Senator Boswell is amused by it; most of us are. We have invariably disposed of this particular resource&mdash;which is typically wasted in Australia&mdash;in our waterways. I am a member of a committee which has spent some time examining the phenomenon of blue-green algae. The consensus is that the entry of nutrients into our waterways is largely responsible for the more regular blooms which are now occurring in our major waterways. To reduce that incidence we now know that we should do more to keep sewage, especially, out of our waterways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We sit here and bicker about unemployment while both the Government and the coalition increasingly endorse the economic rationalist model that dictates that governments should not get involved; they should not intervene in the market; they should keep well out of it, and abrogate that responsibility to lead, encourage and provide financial incentives. That is where we should be directing our attention today, rather than trying to lay blame for a situation of industrial relations that has evolved in Victoria, and rather than trying to skitter away from accepting responsibility for that and putting it onto the other party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unemployed of Australia want to see us recognise the folly of this economic rationalist model, accept the responsibility of intervening in the investment market, recognise employment opportunities and put time and attention into that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of Australia is littered with far too many fine inventions which have been either acquired or stolen in other ways from Australians. We have just sat here and watched another tribe of them disappear overseas through the ideological bent that seemed to be the flavour of the 1980s. We have seen it fail. We have seen it produce the sort of economic situation we have in Victoria. For a while we had a bunch of corporate clever dicks who thought that they could copy the style of international speculation, shuffle money around and thereby convince everybody that they were becoming millionaires.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to be looking away from all that, away from trying to lay blame in the industrial relations area&mdash;an area where we have had so little disputation over the last 10 or 15 years&mdash;and towards realising that the real role of governments is to support the initiatives of technological development, inventiveness and Australian developers to the extent that they are developing real initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should look towards them and invest in them. I am sure the Minister in the chamber, the Minister for Justice, would recognise this as well. They range from small propositions such as that put forward by the Scamander Council on the east coast of Tasmania to the one I mentioned earlier. The Scamander Council wants to pump the wasted sewage resource of that little settlement onto a timber plantation. It requires some $20,000 to get going on that particular enterprise&mdash;an enterprise which would create a capital resource with the potential of providing employment in the future. But, no, it cannot win with that proposition. No government will accept responsibility for recognising that proposition as potential for creating employment. No government wants to do anything about it, and we continue to waste the resource. </PARA>

Victoria's manufacturing industry was the driving force of the Australian economy. It was the centrepiece of the Australian economy. During its term in office, the Labor Government got itself into an absolutely disgraceful basket-case position: the State Bank has lost nearly $3 billion; Moody's Investors Service Inc has just delivered a two-notch downgrading to the State's debt rating; it lost the Tricontinental bank; the Pyramid Building Society went broke; and Victoria's public sector debt now stands at nearly $32 billion, which represents $7,130 for every man, woman and child in Victoria. What does this Government expect the Victorian Government to do? It was voted into office to take actions that would bring Victoria back to its great state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has got into a coalition with Mr Halfpenny. He is calling the shots. He is the Secretary of the Victorian Trades Hall Council. He ended 27 years membership of the Communist Party of Australia in 1979 to join the ALP in 1982. Mr Halfpenny has been described as an old-style Leninist whose leadership style remains true to the Communist Party traditions in which he was nurtured during the 1950s and 1960s. He attended full time training at a party school in the Soviet Union in 1964. As Victorian leader of the Metal Workers Union during the 1970s, Mr Halfpenny played a key role in the strikes of the time, including an eight-week strike which delayed construction of Melbourne's underground loop in May 1976, a four-week garbage strike in 1978 and a nine-week power strike in 1977. The point I am trying to make is that this is the person calling the shots whom those opposite are bowing their knees to and supporting. He is the person that called the strike that those opposite are condoning, and they should be ashamed of themselves. </PARA>

They failed to do that. In the last day or two the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, Mr Carr, said that the call for this national day of action&mdash;as those opposite call it, which in effect means strike&mdash;was purely political. That is borne out by the fact that Mr Halfpenny and Mr Kelty failed to take any action prior to this date. It reflects very badly on them. </PARA>

If we look further, there is a national 24-hour strike in mining. In Victoria there is a 24-hour meat workers strike. In the wool industry, the shearers, shed hands, wool pressers and cooks are to stop work across Victoria for 24 hours. When one looks at all these things and the current account figures which came out today, all one can see is disaster&mdash;action that will make things worse for next month and for this year.

I have had some problems with some of the arrangements that have been made with the accord partners, but I put it to the Minister, who is in the chamber, that if that relationship was so good, strong and effective, the Government could have come out quite clearly and publicly and said, `We have said to our accord partners that this country cannot afford the type of anarchy that we have today'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion which has been placed before the Senate by the Opposition attempts to draw an analogy between the industrial actions that are taking place around the country today in a variety of forms and the alleged damage being done to the economy in a situation where there are one million people unemployed. That is a false analogy, one which I will deal with shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today various activities are taking place around the country, including strikes in some areas. The day of action includes a variety of activities; I notice that meetings and rallies are being held. The Opposition has not made it very clear whether it supports or condemns that sort of activity. I notice that a fair took place yesterday in Melbourne. I would hardly describe those sorts of actions as particularly militant or Marxist-Leninist in their approach. From the rhetoric that is being thrown across the chamber, one would have to believe that we were back in the 1950s hearing about some sort of communist plot to undermine the future economic structure of this country. That is the sort of rhetoric into which the Opposition's contributions are degenerating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a few comments about strikes in general. I was a union secretary. I am proud of it and do not apologise for it. From my general experience in industrial relations and with industrial disputes, union secretaries and union officials&mdash;who are dealt with in abusive terms by those opposite and referred to as union bosses&mdash;cannot get up and simply say, `Look, go on strike'. It just does not work that way. Workers in a dispute have to have a good reason for taking industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all the disputes in which I have been involved in my 10 years, I can say quite honestly that workers who took part in those disputes did so because they wanted to: they were motivated by a desire to either protect or improve their conditions. Unions are made up of workers and workers are not fools; they know what is in their best interests. An individual getting up in front of them simply does not pronounce, `There shalt be a strike'. There has to be, in the overwhelming majority of cases, good reasons for a strike to take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to strikes in general, the record of this Government is a very good one in terms of the number of strikes that have occurred whilst we have been in office; there has been a significant decline in industrial action in this country. There are a variety of reasons for that and I will be quite frank: it is not just because of the accord. The accord has played a very important role in the very rapid decline in industrial disputes in this country, but certainly the recession has also had an effect. But the very rapid decline in industrial disputation commenced well before this recession occurred. I think that is to the credit of the trade union movement. Indeed, whilst the number of strikes has declined, there has been&mdash;except for the last two years&mdash;very significant economic growth and very significant employment growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So to draw a connection between industrial disputes and the one million unemployed is a very simplistic analogy and one that is not correct. If we look around the world today we see that the unemployment rate in the United Kingdom is fast overtaking Australia's&mdash;and if we think we have some economic problems here, we should look at the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has the so-called free labour market that the Opposition is advocating. It is the same in the United States; its unemployment rate is not quite so high, but it again has the so-called free labour market. This continual claim that so-called free labour markets and free wage negotiations between individual employees and employers means that we do not have unemployment is a total myth. There is no evidence that that is the case. There is no evidence around the world that free labour markets lead to lower unemployment. There is not one clear case study that the Opposition has pointed to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in Victoria are angry and we have to ask ourselves why they are angry. I come from Tasmania, and I will make some comments about what has been occurring there. Victoria has attracted a lot of press, but we have had similar sorts of circumstances in Tasmania. Workers are angry in both Victoria and Tasmania because many of their award wages and conditions are being taken away from them by government legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Their annual leave loading is being taken away. It does not matter whether we agree with the annual leave loading or not&mdash;and I will give honourable senators a frank view again: I think the annual leave loading is unsustainable; I just think it is too easy a target. It is not sustainable in the long term, even though it is a very small proportion of labour on-costs, and keeping that target there is not doing the industrial movement any good. But things like weekend penalty rates and shift payments are made because workers are legitimately disadvantaged for working those very unsocial hours and for suffering those sorts of disadvantages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the State Government in Victoria wants unilaterally to take away those sorts of provisions. It is not willing to put a case before the Industrial Commission because the Industrial Commission has been wiped out in Victoria. It is not willing to argue a case. It is making a judgment which is counter to all the empirical evidence that has been produced that there is strong justification for weekend penalties and shift provisions because workers suffer very clear demonstrable disadvantages. It costs more to go to work at weekends because there is no public transport, and child-care centres are usually not open. Honourable senators should work at night on shift work and just see what it is like; it is not a very pleasant lifestyle. But the Victorian Government has decided unilaterally that workers should not be paid anything extra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian Government wanted individual work contracts. This is the great theory that we continue to hear about from the Opposition: that the individual employee and the individual employer know what is best for them. They can sit down sensibly and all arrive at a win-win situation. Everyone will be happy and everyone will be better off. That is the sort of glowing world that the Opposition would have us believe will occur under individual work contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is much harsher. Perhaps some members of the Opposition have not negotiated with employers in the past before coming into this place, but I ask: how would they like it if their children had to go out and negotiate with their employers about annual leave, superannuation, sick leave and basic rates of pay? I suggest that most people&mdash;including most honourable senators&mdash;would not know what an employment contract looks like, let alone what the contents of an employment contract should be. How on earth can individuals who are not educated and trained in employment contracts and employment contract law be expected to negotiate with employers on equal terms?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, employers have accountants, lawyers and security guards who are there to enforce the employers' will. They have the ultimate sanction over the employee&mdash;the power to hire and fire. They can say to an employee, `If you don't like it, lump it. You don't have a job'. Those sorts of individual negotiations are cut to suit the employer. I challenge any member of the Opposition to talk to their children, suggest they negotiate their contracts individually and see what comes out of it. I do not think they would be very pleased with some of the conditions which would be imposed on workers in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria unions do not even have a right of entry&mdash;that is, the right to go into the workplace in order to recruit and protect workers&mdash;apart from this issue of compulsory unionism which the Opposition uses as a smokescreen. In Tasmania there were some reforms of the industrial relations system as well, although they were certainly not as extreme as in Victoria. I will give the Tasmanian Government that; they were much more moderate changes. They include such things as restrictions on the right of entry and individual work contracts, albeit they are vetted by a tribunal in Tasmania so at least there is some safeguard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar pattern has emerged in Tasmania as has emerged in Victoria. Workers are also angry in those two States because they were misled before the elections in both Victoria and Tasmania. Plenty has been said about what happened in Victoria, but not a lot has been said nationally about what happened in Tasmania. In fact, a much more blatant case of misleading the public occurred in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the election of the new Tasmanian Government, the Liberal Party was full of praise and platitudes for the union movement in Tasmania. I have in my possession a speech by the President of the Liberal Party in Tasmania, Mr Eric Abetz, who is also a Senate candidate. He gave a speech to the H.R. Nicholls Society on 4 April this year entitled `Tasmania's window of opportunity: the potential for industrial relations reform' from which I will quote. Mr Abetz said:</PARA>

So, the Party went into the campaign without an industrial relations policy and only addressed the issue when requested to do so by the TTLC.

<PARA>Indeed, Senator Sherry conceded that such a strike creates great economic difficulty for the nation. He also referred to the bitterness and other concerns about such a strike, but he did not condemn the strike. That is what we are saying about Mr Keating. Why did the Government not recognise that political leadership is needed at this stage? Political leadership means going to the trade union movement and persuading it to call the strike off. It does not mean passing some Bill, which is what Senator Sherry implied we were on about, but simply fronting your mates in the ACTU and telling them the country cannot afford it. That is the sort of political leadership that the Government should give us at this stage. But did we get it from the Prime Minister of Australia? Not on your life. </PARA>

Just think of the thousands and thousands of applications for jobs that have been rejected, some of them probably not even responded to. People are desperately looking for jobs. Their lives are falling apart as they try to cope with the situation of being unemployed. Today, the trade union movement called for a 24-hour strike. There can be no reason for it other than it being a political strike. The Prime Minister sits quietly and allows the trade union movement to do it. Of course, the Prime Minister is only interested in one thing: how can he get himself re-elected? If in some way or other this strike persuades some people to fear a future Liberal-National Party Federal government, then the Prime Minister will have achieved his aim today in not criticising the strike. Indeed, one would say that he is welcoming the strike because he sees that it may frighten some people into not voting for us at the next election.

He did that because we were losing so much money every month on the current account. He raised interest rates until he strangled this economy. Certainly, for a short period of time, we stopped losing money on the current account, but the result was over one million people now unemployed. That is the consequence of that policy of the Prime Minister. Having eased interest rates, back we go again: for nine consecutive months there has been a loss on the current account.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite an OECD average unemployment rate of 7 1/2 per cent, we have a nation with more than 11 per cent unemployed&mdash;a nation in which the pace of critical reform measures is too leisurely; in which some industries have received increased protection; and in which productivity is moving backwards. The buck stops with Labor. Over the past decade, it has not had the gumption to take the hard decisions because it would have stepped on the toes of too many of its union mates. We have a labour movement in this country which, in recent times, has not had to flex its industrial muscle because it has long had direct representation in the Cabinet room. But now it perceives that the honeymoon is over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With some Liberal governments now elected at State level able and willing to end this nonsense, the union movement has, with the overt support of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), brought mass chaos, disruption and disorder to most States in Australia&mdash;particularly, in recent times, to New South Wales and Victoria. We have had disruption not only to the millions of other workers not directly involved in these protests but across the country in numerous industries, slowing productivity and retarding growth. And all for what end? Where will it stop? Will it cease when even more Australians have lost their jobs? Will the union bosses be satisfied when there are two million in the unemployment queues because they had to make a point?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kennett Government has, by its win at the Victorian polls some weeks ago, restored hope to what was once a proud and great State; a State which was sent into bankruptcy and economic ruin by years of inept and financially incompetent Labor governments. Hope has been restored by the election of the Kennett Government. But these hopes of recovery are already being strongly undermined by a determined, vicious and selfish union movement which is railing against Premier Kennett's intended industrial reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These mass action movements are not confined to Victoria, where thousands of workers are told by their union bosses to oppose the Victorian Government's industrial relations policy. The saddest feature about these nationwide industrial stoppages and days of protest action, as they are called, is that there will be no winner. The union bosses' strategies to castigate employers outside Victoria for the political reforms of the Victorian Government are nothing short of deranged. All these days of action around the country will have absolutely no effect on Premier Kennett's reform policies, because they will go ahead. Indeed, they must go ahead or Victoria will continue to go right down the drain and unemployment queues will grow larger day by day, as industries close down or move elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stoppages will, however, damage the speed of recovery for industries and the expansion of employment prospects of those already reliant on the public purse. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Industrial Relations have both encouraged this blatant abuse of union power to try to destabilise the coalition Government ever since Premier Kennett was swept to office. This is the strategy they have been working on for months, in concert with the ACTU and thugs such as Halfpenny, in the face of the inevitable defeat of Labor in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The blame for Victoria's economic and ensuing industrial disharmony lies squarely at the feet of the ousted Cain-Kirner Labor Government and not with Premier Kennett. It was the former Premier's Government which constructed and maintained the largess for thousands of public sector employees throughout Victoria. Even some Labor supporters have realised that government should no longer support the totally unsustainable featherbedding evident in some public sector jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New South Wales Labor leader Carr was summarily dismissed by ACTU officials when he condemned these stoppages as inappropriate, given the country's current chronic economic problems. The union bosses do not listen to him, so they are not about to listen to anyone else. Even Bob Carr can see that the days of sledge-hammer industrial action are well and truly over. It is a pity his union mates are blinded to truth and reason because they would have even more workers lose their jobs and their income when ports, factories and mines close, just to make this futile political point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just Labor leaders who are giving the union bosses a bit of stick about the country and where it is headed. Respected Industry Commission Chairman, Bill Scales, has made it quite clear in that organisation's annual report that the mythology created by Mr Keating is damaging and disfiguring this country. He talks about a 6 per cent underlying rate of unemployment remaining with us even after the end of this recession, and the government of the day needing to push ahead vigorously and aggressively with micro-economic reform if unemployment is to go below that 6 per cent. This is exactly what Jeff Kennett is doing&mdash;meeting the challenge of industrial and micro-economic reform which the Federal Labor Government has failed to meet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the Industry Commission agrees that that reform must be embraced more wholeheartedly than in the past, yet we have these Luddite unions roaring in and saying, `No, thank you very much; not this century'. They are saying that they do not want prosperity for all Australians if they are going to have to give up some power to achieve it. They are saying that they are going to remain exactly as they have always been, even though our economy is shot to pieces and over one million people are out of work. They are saying, `Don't give an inch', because they do not give a damn for Australia or anyone else living here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a too inflexible labour market and it is well and truly caught in a roller-coaster economy. We must face up to our declining international competitiveness and unions must put to their membership the question of their relevance in an era when productivity principles and enterprise bargaining will become as commonplace as industrial go-slow and down tools of an earlier decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister and the Minister for Industrial Relations could do some real good for this country for a change by showing some leadership and by reigning in their misguided union mates and advising them that the long term ills created by their own Government require long term solutions for all Australians and not merely the self-serving actions taken by a few that we have seen taken in these industrial disputes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The subject of this debate on a matter of urgency has been explained already, but I would just like to add some other thoughts to those that have already been put forward today. It is not simply a matter of people protesting for the sake of protesting. What has been done is not simply a matter that this Parliament can, with a sense of righteousness, condemn, because there have been things in Victoria, perpetrated by the Government down there, which this chamber has been very silent about when it should not have been.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not simply that the Government in Victoria has tried to remove certain rights from workers, such as the 17 1/2 per cent leave loading; it has, in fact, removed those institutions which were set up to protect people's rights. For example, the Accident Compensation Tribunal was abolished without any word of protest from this chamber, even though the Law Council of Australia was concerned about it, and even though the Bar Council in Victoria and the Law Institute of Victoria were concerned about it. A letter dated 3 November and signed by Mr Hughes, the President of the Law Institute of Victoria, and Mr Jessup, QC, Chairman of the Victorian Bar Council says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Abolition of the Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill does not make provision for the futures of the judges by way of recognising their security of tenure. As this threatens judicial independence, we urge you to ensure the continued judicial status in employment in some appropriate way of all presidential members of the tribunal. Judicial independence is fundamental to the maintenance of respect for the rule of law and good government. Expertise in this highly technical legal area cannot be acquired overnight. The judges should not be cast aside.</PARA>
<PARA>What is the propriety, as a chamber of the Parliament, of our condemning people who are protesting about their treatment when the sorts of institutions that have been set up to protect them are abolished without one word of protest from this chamber? What has this chamber said about the attack on judicial independence that was made with the abolition of the Accident Compensation Tribunal, which was there to see that there was justice for people injured in the workplace and for employers? What was said in this chamber about the abolition of the Victorian Industrial Relations Commission, again, a body which was set up to protect people employed in the State of Victoria?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most shameful episode of all is the fact that we have not protested about the reduction in the ability of parliamentarians in Victoria to go about their duties. When the Executive&mdash;that is, the ministry whom parliamentarians, as members of the legislature, attack day after day in Question Time and bring to account&mdash;is increased in Victoria, both in terms of numbers and facilities, and, at the same time, the ability of parliamentarians to do their duty is reduced, nobody gets up in this chamber and protests. The legislature is important; it is there to protect people. When people in Victoria and elsewhere see the way those institutions which have been established to protect their rights are reduced, no wonder there is a protest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect and apologies to Martin E. Muller, when the Victorian Government attacked the Victorian Industrial Relations Commissioner, I was not concerned. When the Victorian Government attacked the Accident Compensation Tribunal, I was not concerned. When it attacked the unions, I was not concerned. When it attacked the very institution of parliament, I was not concerned. Then, when it attacked me, there was nobody left to be concerned. When people see the traditional rights that they have come to rely upon attacked in the way they have been and no-one in this Parliament protests about it, what are they to do but to try desperately to bring some attention to it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people do that, what are they condemned for doing? They are condemned for being subject, so it is said, to union bosses. Conciliatory phrases, such as `thugs like Halfpenny', have been used in this chamber. The use of that phrase indicates that the other side perceives that this dispute has been caused by `thugs like Halfpenny'. Mr Halfpenny is the very respected secretary of the Trades Hall Council in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a laugh from those opposite. If Senator Parer and Senator Crane checked this, they would find that Mr Halfpenny has brought more good to industry in Victoria&mdash;by the statement of those industrialists&mdash;than he has caused otherwise. It is just a sign that there is a blindness on the part of those opposite to see the good that has been done by workers and their representatives in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to know why Mr Gordon Hughes, President of the Law Institute of Victoria, and Mr Jessup, Chairman of the Victorian Bar Council, said this about the Acts and Compensation Work Cover Bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a cause of grave concern that common law rights are removed and introduced retrospectively.</PARA>
<PARA>That is how the sentence reads. I think it should read, `It is a cause for grave concern that common law rights are removed and rendered nugatory retrospectively'. But the point is that it is retrospective legislation that has removed rights from people in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that the motion today would at least have contained a provision that, in so far as the Government of Victoria has reduced, and even destroyed, long held rights that not only workers but people generally had come to rely on, that should be reversed. I would have hoped that those opposite, who are of the same political persuasion as the Government in Victoria, might have said something about all that. But apparently that has not happened. On Friday, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Workers who breach an employment contract, or anyone who induces a worker to breach any provisions of the contract, are liable for fines starting at $1000.</PARA>
<PARA>Why should a worker who breaches his or her employment contract, perhaps by arriving late or taking a day off when he or she should not, be find $1,000? That is not how contracts are normally enforced. The criminal law is not used to enforce contracts. Does Senator Crane say that the breach of contracts should be visited by criminal penalties? When people protest, who are condemned?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the documents.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I wish to comment on two of the three statements that you tabled today: the first one, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Criticism of the Senate by the Prime Minister</EMPHASIS> and the second, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Questions relating to Opposition policy</EMPHASIS>. These are very important statements because they involve what I believe to be significant issues of principle. The first statement relates to the duties of the President and the behaviour of the Prime Minister, and those are the principles which I wish to canvass. The second statement relates to the nature of Question Time and the constraints which are placed on Ministers in answering questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me preface my remarks by suggesting that the roles of the Presiding Officers&mdash;the Speaker and the President&mdash;are probably receiving closer scrutiny than at any other time in memory, and possibly since Federation. I believe that this has come about as a result of a number of factors. First, there is the widespread perception that parliamentary standards have declined dramatically in the 1980s, and the community is looking to its parliamentary leaders to take action to raise those standards. You, Mr President, as one of the ranking officers of the Parliament, hold an office which encompasses a very long tradition, and I believe that you are one of those people that the community is looking to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the advent of television broadcasting of Question Time I believe has given further focus to the key role of the Presiding Officer. Thirdly, I think there would be general agreement that the controversial activities of the Speaker in the other place has led to widespread media debate over quite a long period of time. Finally, there is the perception in some quarters at least that Presiding Officers must take some of the responsibility for the decline in parliamentary standards. For example, I draw your attention to a recent paper released by a former Speaker, Dr Ken Coghill, and a former President, Mr Hunt, of the Victorian Parliament, where it was suggested that the decline of Question Time had resulted in part because of the rulings by the Presiding Officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we all have a responsibility for maintaining parliamentary standards. In the context of these remarks I do not pretend to say that you, Mr President, and the Speaker, have the key role, but I think you have an important role to play in ensuring that parliamentary standards are maintained. We have enough examples, which I do not wish to canvass today, of what happens when a Presiding Officer is perhaps not prepared to use the full authority of his office to maintain standards in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the challenge facing Presiding Officers in this Parliament has become particularly significant because of the key role that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) himself has played in the degeneration of parliamentary standards. Are Presiding Officers going to accept the standards of the Prime Minister? Whatever the decision of the Speaker in the other place may be, there is in my view no reason why the President of the Senate should not stand up to the Prime Minister when the matter relates to the conduct of the Senate, and when we believe that proper parliamentary conduct has not occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is true to say that, unlike any other Prime Minister in Australian history, Mr Keating seems to have an unbridled contempt for the political institutions that have served this nation so well for almost a century. I believe the abuse of Question Time in the other place is the most obvious manifestation of this contempt. In addition, Mr Keating has attacked the role of the head of state and, in his most recent remarks, attacked the Senate. It seems to me that no part of our constitutional arrangements is immune from the Prime Minister's venom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question before this chamber, I believe, is: can the community look towards the Presiding Officers to assist in the improvement of parliamentary standards? Mr President, I believe that this was the challenge you were faced with when the Prime Minister referred to senators as `unrepresentative swill'. I believe that a statement by you would have made a very substantial and important community impact. The statement, I believe, that would have been appropriate&mdash;and I put this on the table&mdash;would be along these lines: it would be appropriate if the Prime Minister adhered to longstanding tradition and avoided reflection on members of the Senate. Such a statement would have been widely welcomed in the community. It would have affirmed the importance of your office in maintaining parliamentary standards and certainly affirmed in the community the view that parliamentary standards are worth defending and that you see your role in that light, as well as the other duties that you have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a statement by you would have been fully in line with Standing Orders, longstanding traditions and relations between the chambers, and based upon appropriate precedents. There seems little doubt that Mr Keating's reference to senators as `unrepresentative swill' was offensive, both in terms of the Standing Orders of the other place, and contrary to the tradition, outlined in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS>, that `members and senators should refrain from reflections on members and proceedings of the other chambers'. In other words, what I am putting to you, Mr President, is that it was not a complex problem that you were faced with; it was a clear breach of the courtesy which should exist between the chambers. I believe that, because of your office, an immediate response from you would have affirmed in the community mind the importance of high standards in parliamentary conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In your paper you said that you had examined the papers of your predecessors and could find no examples of Presiding Officers responding to such criticisms. That may well be the case, but I suggest that this is probably because this is the first time a Prime Minister has launched such an insulting attack upon senators. I do not pretend that the chamber has not been criticised from time to time by other political leaders, and there may well be examples from my own Party, but I suspect that the disgraceful, insulting terms in which that attack was launched are unprecedented in Australian history. It is not surprising that you could not find precedents. Mr President, I wonder whether you are able to provide the chamber with examples of any other Prime Minister who has indulged in such demeaning language about senators as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are precedents where Presiding Officers have made statements when the Parliament has been attacked. I draw your attention to a statement by the President of the Western Australian Legislative Council. The President criticised a magistrate who, among other things, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . maybe the lowest form of life is in the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>A magistrate made that comment in sentencing an offender. You will be interested to know that the President of the Western Australian Legislative Council took considerable objection to that statement by a magistrate. He suggested, among other things, that the magistrate should note the comments of Lord Denning, which I propose to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, and should avoid making privileged statements offensive to the legislative arm of government and members of the House that invite retaliation resulting in further damage being done to the standing of members of parliament and the reputation of judicial officers. I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the remarks of Lord Denning that were quoted by the President of the Legislative Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>

All we would ask is that those who criticise us will remember that, from the nature of our office, we cannot reply to their criticisms. We cannot enter into public controversy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the President of the Legislative Council in Western Australia could censor in moderate language the conduct of a magistrate, how much more important is it that when challenged we should censor foul language and abuse by the most powerful man in this country, the Prime Minister? Mr President, I would like you to reflect on the fact that a Presiding Officer, when faced with a similar problem, decided to adopt a different course from the course that you chose to adopt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast to the language of Mr Keating, it is worth recalling the views of another Labor leader, Mr Chifley, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable Members should not forget that in the life of a democracy, it is important that the public should respect, not necessarily a party, but the Parliament. And everything we do to destroy that respect, deals a blow to democracy itself . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, it is not a matter of asking you to respond to all public attacks on the Senate or seeking to have you become involved with continuing exchanges with critics. I think you made those points in your statement and I would endorse those views. But the Prime Minister is not just another critic; he holds the most powerful office in this country. Mr President, I suspect that, as a result of his comments, you were faced with a special challenge. Regrettably, I believe, you did not respond to that challenge and, as a result, the possibility of striking a blow for higher standards in this Parliament did not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, you said that you did not want to involve your office in a public exchange with the Prime Minister. As might be expected, given Mr Keating's standards, his office had no such compunction and was prepared to tell Michelle Grattan, as was published in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 7 November that, having made contact with the Prime Minister's office, you should `shove it'. I think it was a mistake, to be quite frank, for you to have made contact with the Prime Minister's office. In her article, Michelle Grattan said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier, Sibraa had told Keating's senior staffer he might have to write Keating a brief letter about the approach he'd had from the Liberals. He was seeking advice from the Senate clerk. The PM's advice to Sibraa on such a letter was unequivocal: "Shove it". Sibraa told the Senate on Thursday: "It is not my role . . . to enter into a political debate between members of the two houses.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I put it to you that you were conscious of the problem involved here. As to whether you should have approached the Prime Minister's office&mdash;I note that you said that you approached the Prime Minister to inform him that such a statement had been made&mdash;the Prime Minister was quite happy to enter into a public debate with you and his office leaked to Michelle Grattan the substance of those comments; so your courtesy and your efforts to fulfil your duty as you saw it, and there is some debate about that, was not reciprocated by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I thought some interesting points were made in the debate surrounding your decision. I recognise that it is a debate. I suspect that men and women of goodwill will come down on either side on such an issue. From my own research and reflecting on it, I think the issue is quite clear-cut. Nonetheless, I accept that it is a debate and that others will differ. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Terry Aulich, a distinguished senator and more recently a distinguished author, raised an interesting issue in his contribution when he suggested that your actions had been as scrupulously fair as any President can be, given that you are a member of a political party. It seemed to me that what he gave so generously with one hand he took away with the other. The reality is that, unlike the House of Commons, in Australia we have presiding officers who are members of political parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all aware that this creates special problems and special challenges. I do not think that all the challenges are minus, although there are some concerns in this area. It is not clear to many people that you, unlike most other presiding officers, I suspect, preside over a chamber in which a substantial majority of members do not belong to the same political party as yourself. Mr President, you are a well-respected Presiding Officer and well liked on this side of the chamber and, I assume, amongst your own colleagues. That sort of respect provides you with a stronger basis to maintain Standing Orders and to assert parliamentary standards than might be apparent at first sight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happen to agree with Senator Aulich that we should be looking at whether it is possible in our parliamentary system to create a non-party presiding officer, a so-called independent presiding officer. There are complications with that, but it is certainly a challenge which should be taken up. I would like to see more research done on that particular issue. Speaker Snedden canvassed it very extensively before he left office. With my own parliamentary experience and after reading what Speaker Snedden said, I have some sympathy with the views that he expressed. It is interesting that Speaker Rozzoli of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not attend party meetings. I don't attend party functions, except in the electorate, where I've obviously got to go back and fight an election and I have an electorate so I've got to be party-political to some extent there.</PARA>
<PARA>Speaker Snedden held a similar view. Those are the sorts of issues that should be considered by both sides of the Parliament: to what extent we can buttress the office of the Presiding Officer from party influence. For example, to the extent that this happens, it is probably a bad thing for the presiding officers to be present at meetings where parliamentary tactics are discussed. It puts the presiding officers in a very difficult position and leaves them open to attack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Mr President, I want to briefly look at the questions which relate to Opposition policy. This is another challenge that you have been faced with in this chamber. It has become a contentious issue, again in part because of the behaviour of the Prime Minister, who generally believes that Question Time should be a launching pad against the Opposition rather than for questions about his administration. The purpose of Question Time as outlined in Odgers' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS> is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without doubt, to the onlooker the most obvious manifestation of responsible Government, i.e. the direct accountability of the Executive to the Parliament, is question time. For about an hour, Senate Ministers are subjected to the questions of private Senators, both Government members and Opposition members, with respect to the administration of their departments and the departments they represent in the Senate on behalf of Ministers in the House of Representatives. With a variety of questions, the searchlight is thrown on to all aspects of government activities, and Ministers must account for their administration.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that is a somewhat purist view of Question Time. I happen to agree with Senator Robert Ray that Question Time is inevitably a robust period when great clashes of values and ideas occur. I think those clashes are by no means a bad thing, and it is important that they be exposed in a public forum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not dispute with Senator Ray that questions about Opposition policies have occurred. They have occurred with increasing frequency in the other place and they have occurred in this chamber. Senator Ray brought to our attention four or five examples of where the previous Government asked questions about Opposition policies. I had a cursory glance at all the references that Senator Ray made. My impression is&mdash;and, as I say, it was a cursory glance&mdash;that the questions appear to be more one-off questions rather than a constant, deliberate strategy to ensure that a significant proportion of the 40 to 50 minutes which is taken up by Government Ministers at Question Time is taken up with attacking the policies of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a problem that we have to face up to in this chamber. It is clear from the previous rulings of the Presiding Officers, including some of your rulings, Mr President, that questions on Opposition policies are out of order. I think it is a pity, on reading the examples given in the paper that you tabled, Mr President, that your 1987 ruling tended to dilute the previous rulings of Presidents which made it pretty clear that, whatever had been the examples in the past&mdash;and Senator Ray has brought us those examples&mdash;certainly, until 1987, those questions were largely out of order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is inevitable that, in the context of Question Time, there is going to be a very heavy debate in this chamber and, from time to time, this will involve questions on the policies of the Opposition. I suggest that that is a different matter from having question after question and answer after answer constantly devoted to attacking and, in some cases, misrepresenting the policies of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This problem has been highlighted by the fact that the proceedings of this chamber are now televised. It may not have been such a problem when the public scrutiny was not so obvious, but to imagine that Opposition senators are going to sit quietly while Minister after Minister gets up and drops buckets on their policies and refuses to answer reasonable questions about their own activities is expecting a great deal of tolerance on the part of Opposition parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, this is a major issue. Having looked at the way questions have been asked and answers given in recent weeks, again we see Ministers adopting a bit of the tactic we have seen in the other place where the sole focus of Question Time has been to attempt to attack the Opposition rather than account for the administration of the Government as outlined in Odgers' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS>. I notice that Senator Ray has a large wad of papers in front of him, so he is obviously going to query my comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest this issue has to be addressed. It is certainly one view that Ministers have to answer for their own policies and administration, but when it tips over so that one-off examples of Ministers attacking Opposition policies become a matter of deliberate strategy, the whole nature of Question Time has changed. Therefore, we have to reflect on what must be done in terms of your rulings, Mr President, to see whether we can attempt to at least bring Question Time back into a position where people have the right to hear what the Government policies are, rather than ceaselessly hear attacks on the policies of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, whereas I have differed from you in relation to your approach to the Prime Minister's disgraceful attacks and, to a certain extent, in relation to your Question Time rulings, I stress that I make these comments in a constructive manner. But unless we deal with the problem of Question Time, I suspect that it is asking an awful lot of the people on this side of the chamber to remain quiet while Ministers get up and ceaselessly attack and, on many occasions, misrepresent the Opposition's policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I like these debates because I get an indication of who, a hundred years hence, will be nominated for sainthood. It is quite a long process from beatification through to canonisation, but I like to be here on the ground floor to listen to the pious statements from some of those opposite when it comes to matters of Standing Orders&mdash;their rigid adherence to the rule and their humble subservience to the great virtues of this chamber. It is a pity that most of their activities the rest of the time are diametrically opposed to what they preach in here when we come to procedure debates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there will always be a decline in parliamentary standards. For 90 years people have probably been whingeing, on and off, about a decline in parliamentary standards. What happens in this chamber changes from decade to decade, and past precedent is sometimes useful and sometimes absolutely useless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been in this chamber only a few years, but the first matter greatly exploited here was petitions. I remember when one Wednesday&mdash;because, of course, that was a broadcast day&mdash;we went for 47 minutes, with honourable senators jumping up and reading petitions. In the end, I think we were all sick of it. If anyone started that trend, it was this side of the chamber rather than that side. So one of the great leaks, if you like, in Senate procedure was blocked off and now the Clerk of the Senate reads out petitions. There was then a little variation in procedure. We would get petitions which were not in conformity with Standing Orders and they would be read out on radio broadcast day. But I think an Opposition initiative suggested that those could be read out only on non-broadcast day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second great explosion was in notices of motion, where we had a proliferation not only in numbers but also in length and content. But, again, that has been restricted. Then we had the great noting of answers to questions episode. In the Fraser years, probably five answers were noted after Question Time in seven or eight years. But within a year, I think in excess of 100 to 150 answers to questions were noted. So we have cut that back and introduced Standing Orders that restrict the noting of answers to questions to half an hour, and four minutes per speaker. Of course, today, the new puerile trick is to hold up newspaper headlines in unison around the back of the chamber. That is supposed to be a wonderful innovation in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, the authority is best held in this chamber, if there is a little more discipline shown by both sides. But I do not blame the Presiding Officer for not enforcing anything. When he has had to take the ultimate step to enforce discipline, on three occasions that I can remember no-one on that side supported him&mdash;yet most, in their heart of hearts, would have thought that the President's actions were justified. There was the naming of Senator Walters five years ago&mdash;and I am not trying to harp on that; I use that as one example&mdash;and the naming of Senator Kemp when he was actually thrown out of the chamber and then we had to bring him back. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It comes back to what a glass jaw this chamber has. I have been embarrassed to be a senator and hear the weak and wimpish attitude of those opposite. Just because the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) gets into us, it is the end of the world. The Prime Minister makes a statement about us, and what do we do? We take our bat and ball and go back home. We do not even send him a message from this chamber to his chamber to say what we think of that view. Those opposite are very thin skinned. The Prime Minister makes a reference to Senate `swill' and that is the end of the world and the most important issue around, when it should be regarded as just a trivial issue and criticism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This chamber is very robust in its criticism of all sorts of people in the community. Therefore, we should cop any criticism that comes back. However, there is a big difference, because most people are not covered under law in terms of defamation or anything else when they make a criticism of this place. However, with a few exceptions and if we are reasonably careful, there are no laws of defamation applying to things said by senators in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is pretty weak to carry on in the way Senator Kemp has today about this issue. It is not the first time this has happened. Points of order have been taken and pompous speeches have been made about the number of questions asked here. It is true that from 1980 to 1983 more questions were asked. But, if we go back and check the record, we find that a record number of questions were placed on notice. No wonder so many questions were got through. I invite Senator Kemp and those opposite to go back and have a look, as I have in the last week, at the length of some of the answers in that period; it was well and truly equal to anything we have done in the last few years, and sometimes well and truly in excess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp started quoting the President of the Western Australian Legislative Council. That is hardly the most democratic body I have ever struck but, according to Senator Kemp, it is supposed to be setting the record. If it had not been so obdurate in 1988-89 or so committed to rigging the electoral system and had let the original Bill through on the distribution of electorates&mdash;as Senator Chaney was forced to nominate in this chamber&mdash;the Liberal Party would have won the 1989 election. So Senator Kemp need not tell me about the Western Australian Legislative Council and hold it up as a particular example that we should follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp went on to quote a great Labor Prime Minister, Ben Chifley. I dare say that anyone in Ben Chifley's position would absolutely laud Parliament if they had a majority in both Houses. But this mob opposite will not walk out next week and advocate that the Victorian Government give up its majority in the Legislative Council in Victoria. Oh, no! Dr Hewson is on the record as saying that he desperately wants to control both chambers. If this chamber under a Hewson government had the impertinence to reject anything, he would go straight off to the Governor-General the second time around and there would be a double dissolution. That is what has been promised and that is how much the Liberal Party is committed to non-party rule in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we are hearing today are bleatings from people who do not have a majority. We do not have a majority either and we have to live with that. Senator Kemp went on to ask for higher standards. This comes from someone who interjected a minimum of 30 times today at Question Time in breach of Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then went on to discuss the question of the political allegiance of Presiding Officers. We do not have a system which allows us to follow the British system. Britain has 635 seats and a long tradition in this way. The first moment the Liberal Party decides to have an independent Speaker and we agree to it, that Speaker would come from the most marginal seat, as would be the case with the Labor Party. Golly, gosh; that locks up one seat at the next election, does it not? Those opposite need not tell me they would not do it. We would do it; they would do it. They would do the same with the President. Would they run the President as No. 1 one or No. 2 on their ticket? Of course not. They would run him down at No. 5 or No. 6 so that he automatically had to be elected. That was a silly suggestion. I am sure Mr President would not mind going one berth higher but, with your track record, Mr President, I know you will pull off the third spot in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that irritates me is that the subject of Speaker Snedden has once again been resurrected in the Senate&mdash;`Saint Snedden' of the House of Representatives. He was fairly neutral in his political approach. Everyone in that chamber knows why; because he hated Fraser. That is why he could be politically neutral. He was paid off with the Speaker's job. That was fair enough. All parties have done that over the years to get rid of a critic. But he was pretty neutral because he disliked Fraser almost as much as he disliked us. But it did not stop him from interfering in the design of this building to make sure that the Opposition executive party room was as small as possible. We got all sorts of complaints from members of the Opposition over this, but Speaker Snedden did that to punish us long term. All that was wrong with it was that we won the 1983 election and now those opposite have to cop that. Half the design of this building was perverted to suit Speaker Snedden and get revenge over Fraser and anyone else that he thought he could get revenge over. So those opposite need not put up Speaker Snedden as the great neutral Speaker and Presiding Officer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, the whole issue of `Senate swill' is too much sensitivity from those opposite. It is either a pretence or those opposite are very puerile in their attitude. But let me move on to the second issue&mdash;objections to questions. Reading the Standing Orders&mdash;as we have on occasions with regard to questions&mdash;we all know just how useless the Standing Orders are in this regard because one really should not even make statements of facts or names unless it is absolutely necessary, or strictly necessary, to render the question intelligible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A question is not allowed to contain arguments, inferences, imputations, epithets, ironical expressions or hypothetical matter. That is done here every day by those in opposition; we do not object to that. And a question should not ask for an expression of opinion. How often does that occur? A question should not ask for a statement of government policy or for a legal opinion. Maybe that is the one that is most knocked out here. Nor should a question refer to debates in the current session or proceedings in committee not reported to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How often have we had an MPI listed and had eight or nine questions at Question Time referring to that MPI? It happens all the time. On the problem of whether Ministers are allowed to refer to Opposition policy, a lot of points have been made by, I think, Senator Kemp and Senator Bishop very selectively quoting rulings on this particular matter. If they care to go back and research it, they will find that nine times out of 10 the Presiding Officer, Labor or Liberal&mdash;be it Senator Condor Laucke, Senator Young, Senator Sibraa or Senator McClelland&mdash;ruled in favour of the person asking the question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before Senator Walters interjects, `Rubbish!', she should have a look at the record. I will just go through a few examples that I picked from the period 1980 to 1983. On 25 March 1980, Senator Hamer asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Has the Minister representing the Prime Minister seen details of the proposals of the Australian Labor Party to create 100,000 jobs at a cost to revenue of $180m a year? What would be the effects on inflation of such a scheme? Would such a scheme in fact create more jobs? Has the Minister seen a record of comments of the former Labor Premier of South Australia, Mr Don Dunstan, that the ALP's basic assumption is not valid and that the level of unemployment could be expected to increase?</PARA>
<PARA>That is a direct question on ALP&mdash;the then Opposition&mdash;policy. It is good enough for the Liberals but it is not good enough for any Labor backbencher to ask such questions. But let us deal with the interjection, `Rubbish!', by Senator Walters. On 10 November 1981, Senator Walters said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. Has the Minister noted that the Australian Labor Party's new defence policy is based on Australia's need for defence self-reliance? Can the Minister say whether this now represents endorsement of the Government's defence planning policy?</PARA>
<PARA>I will try to keep this one quick because I did quote it the other day. On 28 February 1982, Senator Hill said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But is such a statement consistent with announced Federal Labor Party policy on uranium mining?</PARA>
<PARA>What about Senator Walters again? She is a definite recidivist on this issue. On 26 February 1980, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My question follows that of Senator Wriedt and is also directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I preface it by reminding the Minister of an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 4 February this year, in which the Opposition spokesman on energy stated that the Australian Labor Party's oil policy would be to adjust petrol prices in line with the consumer price index or with import parity, whichever was the lesser. Is this not a contradiction of Labor's previously announced policy to cut petrol prices? Further, how could the ALP justify its broken promise to the Australian motorist, given that it will not admit that import parity pricing encourages conservation and provides funds for further exploration?</PARA>
<PARA>A blatant example of questioning of an Opposition's policy. Or we could go to what Senator Young said on 16 September 1980:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Has the Minister for National Development and Energy seen further statements by Mr Keating of the Australian Labor Party that the Labor Party would freeze the price of petrol for 12 months and then adjust it moderately in accordance with the consumer price index? What effect would this have on the overall Australian crude oil situation, particularly when related to the Labor Party's policy for a resource tax?</PARA>
<PARA>We have Senator Teague jumping in on 8 September 1982 where he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I ask the Minister for Education whether his attention has been drawn to the statement made two days ago by the former Prime Minister, Sir William McMahon, on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS>, that the first reason for the Liberal Party victory and the Australian Labor Party's collapse in the Flinders by-election was `the activities of Dawkins', the education spokesman for the Opposition, and the divisive policy on independent schools announced recently by the Australian Labor Party. What response has there been from Catholic schools and representatives of other independent schools by way of endorsement of the Government's firm commitment of support for all non-government schools?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but it is on Opposition policy. If Senator Teague wants to go back and debate the merits of a 10-year old policy, I dare say we will, but all I am showing is that when Senator Teague and others bleat away here at Question Time he did it in government as a backbencher trying to make his way up the greasy pole; so why blame anyone on this side for doing it? Why bleat on at Question Time and badger the President about it with points of order? We have another question here from Senator Noel Crichton-Browne on the Labor Party's policy on uranium. We have Senator Bonner on 16 February asking a question about the Labor Party's capital gains tax. There is a question by Senator Messner on Opposition policy on 31 March 1980. He is asking another direct question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it more likely that Mr Keating is seeking to mislead the people of Australia for political purposes?</PARA>
<PARA>And on he goes. It covers the whole ideological spectrum of the coalition. Senator Peter Baume asked this question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Did the Labor Party's recent Federal Conference adopt a policy opposed to all new uranium mining? Does the new Labor policy announced by Mr Isaacs, the Leader of the Opposition in the Northern Territory, confirm a split in the Labor Party over uranium mining&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>et cetera. Senator Teague is mentioned in dispatches again on 16 November 1982. He was very diligent in asking about our policy. There is no rumour in the fact that he seeks to be a member of the Labor Party and wants to discuss it in here consistently. Occasionally, a point of order is raised. My colleague Senator Tate, from Tasmania, objected to Senator Teague's question on Labor Party policy and the President said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no point of order. I call the Minister.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the other half there was no objection taken. They were far more relaxed, they were not as thin-skinned and they were not as gutless in those days; and we had such good policies we did not mind the Opposition debating them in here at all. It is only because the Opposition has such cruddy policies that it never wants the spotlight put on them. That is why those opposite are trying to repackage and paddle under water as quickly as they can at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should not be that Question Time simply becomes a consideration of Opposition policies at any one time. It is only fundamentally a correct question when the Government is asked whether it would adopt those policies. Some scope has to be allowed for that, but you, Mr President, have been quite consistent in asking the Minister to get back to the point. Therefore, there is a midway, and I believe you have ruled in a particular and correct way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, at different times your rulings have brought grief to both sides of this House. You have managed to preside over this chamber with a great degree of impartiality in the time that you have held the post. You have annoyed both sides and you have also appeased both sides in your rulings. That is the way it should be. I often think that sometimes the objections taken by those opposite are meant more to disrupt the proceedings at a particular time. I do not say that that is a consistent pattern, but from time to time I believe that has also occurred. I acknowledge that it occurs on either side of the chamber when either party is in opposition. But it should be taken too seriously when and if it does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no real comments on amendments and requests, which I think are covered somewhere in this documentation, because I have not read the papers in any detail. The question of motions for suspension of Standing Orders is one which we have debated here, not necessarily in a partisan way, because I think we can all see some of the problems indulged here. The first of two matters which I wish to address is the Prime Minister's criticism. I do not believe it is up to the President of the Senate to publicly defend the role of the Senate. Any individual senator can do that or senators can do it as a collective. If they want to do it, they can do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter relates to questions that involve some reference to Opposition policy. Mr President, I believe you have allowed them in terms of whether the Government will adopt a particular policy, but you have also occasionally tried to bring a Minister back to the main substance of a question. I think those opposite who object are absolute hypocrites, having done it themselves. Sure, the junior woodchuck class that has come in since the coalition was last in government is allowed far more licence in these matters because it has no track record at which we can point. Three of them thought they could get away with that on another occasion, when they came from the House of Representatives, but we caught them out, too, by looking up their record in that place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The record shows that the bleating over this issue of the other 11 or so who served here over a number of years from 1975 through to 1983 is nothing more than hypocrisy. They were in like Flynn when they had the chance on the government back bench from 1975 to 1983. I do not believe they have been converted on this issue. I would like to think that is the case, but I do not think it is. Mr President, I commend you for bringing down these rulings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I wish to speak briefly on these documents. I really rise to speak to the ruling that you put down&mdash;`confirmed' might be another way of expressing it&mdash;on motions for suspension of Standing Orders. Before commenting on that, I should say that it is still the view of honourable senators on this side that the President does have a responsibility out of his office to uphold the reputation of this place, because the standing of this place is vitally important within the democratic process in Australia. When the institution is attacked, as it was by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), we expect a President, no matter which side of the Parliament the President comes from, to take some action. That matter has been debated, and I do not know whether it will progress any further than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue is the abuse of Standing Orders by Ministers in addressing Opposition policy during Question Time. I think the point that the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) has failed to appreciate is that occasionally when we were in government we asked such questions and occasionally they were objected to, but we did not subject the Opposition to the continual tactic of a whole stream of questions on Opposition policy. This Government and these Ministers have abused the Standing Orders by developing a whole string of questions on Opposition policy as a tactic to be used in literally every Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister said that we are soft on taking the debate. The problem is that in Question Time we do not have the opportunity to take the debate. We want to debate policy; there has probably been no Opposition in history which has wanted to make political debate on policy and issues like this one. But the Standing Orders do not protect a Minister who wants to abuse his obligation to answer questions relating to the administration of government policy. That is why we have been continually taking points of order and why we will continue to do so. Mr President, we will ask that you keep Ministers within the Standing Orders and, as you say in your statement, that they are not permitted to use the Question Time procedure to debate Opposition policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue that I want to mention, which has not really been dealt with in this debate, is the use of the contingent notice of motion in relation to suspending Standing Orders. Mr President, I want to raise it because, with respect, I do not agree with your opinion or your ruling. I do not seek to take the matter to formal dissent, but if I do not mention disagreement at this stage and it occurs again you or a future President may mention the fact that we did not rise to dispute it at the relevant time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have said, Mr President, that we have a precedent that, if more than one contingent notice of motion is moved while the Senate is under guillotine, as President you should disallow that because it in effect becomes an abuse of the restraint of the guillotine. I think we accepted that on the last time, somewhat reluctantly. We were even more reluctant, however, to accept it in relation to a senator from a third party because, if you allow one from one side of the chamber to move such a contingent notice, we could not really see any logical argument that would oblige you to disallow it with regard to a third senator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this occasion the Senate was not under the constraint of a guillotine. You have said, however, that, because the proceedings of the Senate had been suspended so that the Senate had returned to continue the same debate, you were under that constraint. But I do not see that constraint in the Standing Orders, provided that the motions were moved before the Senate got back into that debate, as they were in the instance that is in question, which was on 12 November. I do not see any limitation in the Standing Orders at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that day, I moved a contingent notice of motion to suspend Standing Orders firstly to seek a Question Time, and that was defeated. Then, on a totally separate matter, I moved suspension of Standing Orders in order that we might condemn the Government for the high level of unemployment. It was a different motion and a positive motion&mdash;nothing to do with the suspension for Question Time at all. I cannot see any restriction within the Standing Orders on doing that and I do not think the argument you applied, using the precedent of the guillotine, works either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be that there is a deficiency within the Standing Orders. It might be that this general contingent notice of motion could arguably require some further constraint and I am open to debate and persuasion on those matters, but I do place on record, Mr President, that I think your use of the precedent of the guillotine is an inappropriate precedent because it does not apply to these circumstances. Therefore, there was not the restraint that you believe there was in my moving the second contingent notice of motion in those circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA>Briefly, the Auditor-General, as usual, has done an excellent job, considering his lack of resources. I think one of the outstanding features of the Auditor-General, and what most of us who are interested in the efficient operation of government look forward to, is the efficiency audits of the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government&mdash;and it is something that has generally received bipartisan support&mdash;has moved to having a financial management improvement program; in other words, let the managers manage. My overall view&mdash;and I say this simply from the experience of having also worked fairly substantially in the private sector in this area&mdash;is that one of the most exacting chores of any government or the private sector is the purchasing function. It is something that has basically been underrated in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not unusual to hear the comment&mdash;and I do not say this as any form of denigration; I say it because I believe that the profile of purchasing people should be lifted&mdash;`He is only a purchasing officer'. I have heard that said in both the private and public sectors, yet the total purchasing of the Government in Australia is about $10 billion, plus or minus 10 per cent. In other words, an improvement in, or a loss of, efficiency of 10 per cent represents $1 billion. So purchasing should be taken very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Purchasing attracts an incredibly high profile in Japan. Over the past 20 or 30 years, Japan has developed from a country that was devastated by war to the leading economic country in the world today. It had no resources to develop, simply its people and its work ethic. Naturally, one of the most important functions in Japan is to be able to purchase materials, commodities and whatever is needed to fuel its industrial machine. There are many lessons to be learned from the Japanese, because they attribute a very high status to those people involved in the purchasing function. I only point out that overview because, having experienced it and learnt from it, I have to say that the rest of the world could take a leaf out of their book. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the financial management improvement program and letting the managers manage has come a diversification of the purchasing function to the extent that, as has been pointed out by the Auditor-General, throughout Australia today, within the Commonwealth there are&mdash;and apparently the figure is not entirely known&mdash;between 13,000 and 20,000 people organising purchasing for the Commonwealth. That is an enormous figure, particularly considering that purchasing is a very specialist function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Purchasing is an area that is not only specialist but is also open to corruption because of the large amount of money involved. We have all heard over the years&mdash;I am not particularly pointing to recent years&mdash;anecdotal stories of people being entertained and specifications being written for a particular product. No doubt the company selling the product would look on that as a selling function, but one wonders about the efficiency of the purchasing process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General pointed out that collective purchasing can be harnessed effectively by using what is called common-use contracts, which are estimated to save the Commonwealth about $60m. But offset against that is the cost of the staffing level of the 13,000 to 20,000 people throughout the various departments, which has been estimated by the Auditor-General to be $56m. That is an incredibly high figure for a purchasing function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to my earlier comment, it seems to me that, with something as critical as purchasing and with all the requirements of all the various departments, we should have a good look at people such as the Japanese, who are the experts in this field. I believe that there should be a centralised coordination role. I do not mean having a small handful of purchasing officers who turn into little Hitlers&mdash;these people must be well aware of what their customers require&mdash;but there should be some overview involved with the purchasing function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, this was a major part of the Department of Administrative Services, but with the FMIP program it has moved out into the various departments. I suppose it could be argued that this should either be done properly or it should not be done at all. But, again referring to the efficiency of the Japanese, it is worth looking at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point made by the Auditor-General is that some 13,000 of these people hold Australian government credit cards. Only 35 per cent of them have any purchasing training whatsoever. I think this is fraught with danger. I do not say this in any political sense whatsoever; I say it in a straight management sense. It should be something that is very carefully looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General makes 19 recommendations in his report. I will not refer to them all; I will just touch on a few. In respect of common-use contracts, the report talks about giving more time to complex common-use contracts and undertaking more detailed planning. On the face of it, common-use contracts have some appeal but, in practice&mdash;and from the discussions I have had with suppliers to the Government&mdash;it seems to me that there is a lot of avenue for improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems with common-use contracts is that, just because a contractor is successful in getting on the list, it does not mean that he will be successful in selling any goods. I believe that the various departments should be more detailed in their specific budget requirements for the items that are purchased under common-use contracts; otherwise there is no incentive for them to be accurate. They can pull a figure out of the air, put it on the list, it gets accumulated, the department goes out for a common-use contract and that then becomes the basis on which departments deal with people who have made the list. That is one side of the coin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side of the coin there are those people who in the main try to tender in a way that gets them on the list. In other words, by no means do they offer their lowest price because by doing so they would be giving their opposition the inside running as to what prices they were quoting. I suppose, from the Commonwealth point of view, that has some</PARA>
<PARA>merit because they know they can bargain down a bit, provided that the people in the other departments doing the purchasing know what they are doing. I think that is the important thing about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the Audit Office recommends that DAS discuss with the Department of Finance the possibility of obtaining funding under community service obligations for those common-use contracts that appear to come under that category. If the common-use contracts with the 2 per cent commission that is paid are properly done and the various departments purchase under the common-use contracts, there should be no need to go back to the Budget and get the taxpayer to pay. In fact, there should be sufficient profit generated from those items of common-use contracts that do not fall under the category of community service obligations to pay for the running of the purchasing section of DAS. </PARA>

<PARA>This is the sixteenth report of the Senate Committee of Privileges concerning a matter raised by a person under Privilege Resolution 5 of 25 February 1988. On 24 November 1992, the President referred to the Committee a letter from Mr D. E. Hennessy relating to remarks made by Senator Watson on 3 November 1992 during the adjournment debate. As Director of the Government Superannuation Office, Mr Hennessy wrote to the President on 20 November 1992, and the matter was referred to the Committee as a submission under Privilege Resolution 5. The Committee has considered the submission and recommends that a response agreed to by Mr Hennessy and the Committee be incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

In the course of his speech he suggested that the Committee might have been "misled by this witness".</PARA>

The situation is clearly set out in my Office's annual report and, indeed, the Third Report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, titled "Super and the Financial System" acknowledged that the funding of the employer component of the Queensland Government's superannuation liabilities is held "in consolidated revenue" (Note (e) to Table 5, p.25).</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to respond to the tabling by Senator Teague of the thirty-ninth report of the Senate Committee of Privileges. This document was forwarded to the President and then on to the Chairman of the Privileges Committee, under the provisions of the Parliamentary Privilege Resolution, by the Director of the Queensland Superannuation Office, Mr Dale E. Hennessy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to point out that this Senate provides a unique opportunity for people outside this chamber who have been referred to or named by senators to respond. Mr Hennessy has afforded himself the opportunity provided by this Senate Privilege Resolution of so responding and the matter is currently before the Senate. In fact, the statements by the Director and his Treasurer, Mr De Lacy, actually make very interesting reading. In that response he writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I did not at any stage advise that this funding was held in a superannuation trust fund.</PARA>
<PARA>By way of background, let me explain: Mr Hennessy was a witness to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and, in his presentation, he indicated that the Queensland superannuation funds were fully funded. It was not a question of whether the funds were a trust fund. But there is an expectation that senior members of the bureaucracy, not only of this Commonwealth Government, but also of the State governments, understand fully the terminology that they use and apply. In his wording and in his presentation, the impression was conveyed that those superannuation moneys were fully funded. In so doing, the Queensland Government&mdash;Mr De Lacy, the Treasurer, and indirectly Mr Hennessy&mdash;was given a great deal of credit in the media and elsewhere for something that is in fact not quite right. It is true that he may have misunderstood the terminology; that is indeed unfortunate. But in this response he did not seek to make that particular point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This ability for members of the public, including public servants, to respond in this manner is a very important privilege. In fact, it is a privilege that not even the House of Commons provides to outside people. It is about time that the Director of the Queensland Government Superannuation Office, Mr Hennessy, and Mr De Lacy, who reported extensively, criticising me in the Queensland Parliament&mdash;I note that I do not have the same right of response in the Queensland Parliament as Mr Hennessy has of responding here, so I take this opportunity of furthering the point I wish to make&mdash;recognised that Queensland, along with the Commonwealth and other States, has superannuation debt. It is about time the Queensland Government recognised that it has superannuation debt too. The statements acknowledge `the funding of the Crown share of the benefits of certain of the Queensland Government's defined benefits fund being in the Consolidated Fund'&mdash;honourable senators should note the words `Consolidated Fund'&mdash;and distinguish between this arrangement and having funding through a trust fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for Mr Hennessy to say, `I did not say that I had it in a trust fund', but the point is that a consolidated fund is not a trust fund, and that is the point I have been making all the way along the line. This is an important clarification which I have been seeking. It adds in a very significant way to the evidence which was given by the Director when he appeared before the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation during its Brisbane hearings earlier this year. The budget practices outlined in the submission to the President are not unusual; in fact, the submission reveals to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation that Queensland funds its obligations in employee superannuation on an emerging cost basis&mdash;just as the Commonwealth and all the other States do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that, subsequently, Mr De Lacy actually acknowledged this in a very indirect way in his lengthy rebuttal of my speech in the Queensland Parliament. What concerns me is the fact that they&mdash;particularly Mr De Lacy&mdash;still continue to believe that this is full funding when it is not. What is full funding? Full funding involves setting assets aside to cover liabilities as they emerge on a regular basis, not as they emerge at the end of a period when a person is about to retire, or something like that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will put it simply, by way of example. If the Queensland Government has 10 employees who are all entitled to 10 per cent employer contribution for one year, and if each had a salary of $30,000, the Government would need to set aside 10 per cent of $30,000 times 10 employees, which would</PARA>
<PARA>equal $30,000 a year. This is what happens in a number of statutory or quasi government superannuation schemes, for example, Qantas employees, Telecom and the Australian National University, but it does not happen in Queensland, which is fair enough, and it does not happen in the Commonwealth, and we acknowledge that point. But the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation singled them out for special comment because of the misleading evidence they gave to the Committee. What happens in Queensland is a mix of obfuscation and round robin accounting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take as an example two big schemes in Queensland: the State Public Sector Superannuation Fund and the Government Officers Superannuation Fund. According to the 1992 reports, which we have here, the first, the State Public Sector Superannuation Fund, had an opening balance of $142,000 on 30 June 1992, estimated receipts of $203,303,000, and&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;outgoings of $203,303,000. In other words, it has apparently received from the portfolio departments an amount equal to its emerging liability, and transferred to the Queensland Government Superannuation Office an identical amount equal to the emerging cost of retirees both past and present, fully funded. At the year's end, there will be a balance in the fund of $142,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other scheme, the Government Officers Superannuation Fund, appears to have operated under a similar scheme of accounting. It has an opening balance of $104,000. It has $118,802,000 in receipts and&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;$118,802,000 payments to retirees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The total public sector superannuation debt in Queensland for 1992-93, according to the emerging cost principle, would be: for the Government Officers Superannuation Fund, approximately $119m; the Parliamentary Superannuation Fund, $3m; the Police Superannuation Fund&mdash;which, incidentally, is $277m in the red&mdash;$82m; the State Public Sector Superannuation Fund $203m; and the State Service Superannuation Fund $73m. That is a total of $479m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators will note from pages 31 and 32 of the document, the total of all cash balances in the five superannuation funds is approximately $2.5m. The question that I ask is: is this sufficient to cover the superannuation debt?  Only an actuary could say, but my hunch is that it falls short&mdash;not by thousands or hundreds of thousands, but by millions of dollars of unfunded liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the superannuation debt provision could have been made in some other section of the account, or a possible parking space for superannuation debt provisions&mdash;and it could be, but we do not know. For example, the Queensland Treasury Corporation Fund, I think, has a balance of $12.7m as at 30 June 1992. Unfortunately, this amount is not disaggregated and, in the scheme of things, is small in relation to superannuation debt, so it is unlikely that it covers the emerging debt burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assuming that Queensland Public Service employee numbers and demographic characteristics remain at a steady rate, if the emerging Consolidated Revenue were of the order of $479m in the next 10 years, then the unfunded liability would be $4.79 billion. For 20 years, it would be more than $9 billion. This is the logic on which the other States, having made a true actuarial assessment, informed the Committee. I must say that it does worry me that the report brings in the words, `the actuary has examined this'. This raises some pretty serious issues. Perhaps we should be having a word with the Commonwealth Actuary. </PARA>

It is one that has to be acknowledged and taken note of. I believe that my statements on this matter during the last few weeks have exploded the myth that has been perpetrated and that Queensland, like all the other States, has superannuation funding liabilities, and the sooner the Queensland Government acknowledges this, the better.</PARA></TALK.START>

Indeed, in 1993-94 the Government will increase expenditure on rail infrastructure by $100 million and labour market programs by $16 million above the amounts previously included in the forward estimates.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will be supporting the National Road Transport Commission Amendment Bill 1992. The Bill amends the National Road Transport Commission Act 1991 to include as a schedule to the Act the agreement made on 11 May this year between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and a number of Premiers and Chief Ministers at a conference in Adelaide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Road Transport Commission was established early this year following legislation passed through the Parliament in December 1991. The present functions of the Commission are related to obtaining uniformity in road transport. It currently applies only to those vehicles over 4.5 tonnes, also known as heavy vehicles. Its functions include seeking uniform legislation, road charges and road user charges, principles for determining road charges and road user charges, and guidelines for the preparation of regulatory impact statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The additional functions that have been conferred on the Commission by the agreement of 11 May include the extension of the Commission's functions to include light vehicles, those being vehicles below 4.5 tonnes. It also includes: the assembly and publication of information on road related charges applying to light vehicles; assistance in developing indicators for assessing the performance of the road system and matters relating to that performance, such as evaluating the efficiency of our road constructions; the assembly and publication of information on road safety; and the monitoring of the use of alternative fuels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The functions of the Commission will not, however, be extended to road charges or economic regulation of the transport industry for light vehicles. Clearly, this Labor Government does not want to lose any of its substantial taxing power over motorists. The Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) has said that the Commission has earned a reputation as a fair and independent body through its formal and informal consultation with both government and industry. Its recommendations on heavy vehicle charges have been received and approved by the ministerial council. The charging determinations have received support from a convincing majority of States. They have also received overwhelming support from the road transport industry, the Business Council of Australia and the Transport Workers Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Government does not feel that this fair and independent body's functions should extend to determining road charges and road user charges into this area of the road transport industry. The Government is clearly not serious about getting as close as possible to the ideal charging system. In the Government's drive to achieve a fair and efficient road transport system, it is not prepared to sacrifice its taxing powers over the road users. Because of this, the charging scheme is not the best that it could possibly be, due to the constraints placed on the Commission by the Labor Government. This clearly shows that the Government is not serious about getting the costs of road transport down. These costs continue to be a burden on business. That is why we address that point with the benefits highlighted under the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that in its road user charge the Government has highlighted the fact that the 18c a litre excise is a notional charge, which basically means that it does not have anything whatsoever to do with road construction or road funding in general. It is merely another tactic of the Government to use the road users of Australia as milch cows. The Liberal and National parties believe that the road user charges should go to road funding. This is not the case with the Government's 18c a litre notional charge; it is clearly another general revenue tax to go to Consolidated Revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Government has said it will continue to index the tax component. That means it could increase the notional charge within a few years and continue to use road users as a source of general revenue. The Labor Government is retaining the option to increase this notional charge at its discretion. This could mean that the 18c could become 24c or could even go to 30c a litre. If current trends are any indicator, only 5c of that would continue to go to road funding. The Government's record on this issue is nothing short of appalling. As long as this continues, an adequate level of road funding cannot be assured, but an unnecessary burden on the road users to fund the Government's other various expenditures can be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of road funding, the Government's record has been much less than commendable. The roads are a major infrastructure asset of our country, especially considering the size of our country and its population spread. This asset requires constant maintenance and upgrading, but the Government's commitment has been less than satisfactory. For all the Government's years in office, excepting 1992-93 since it is an election year and the Government needs votes, road funding has fallen dramatically in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This funding has fallen despite drastic increases of around 150 per cent in the revenue gained from fuel excise. The $2 billion roads funding program for this year only takes it back to where we were 10 years ago. However, fuel excise revenue will be around $7,300m this year. This means only 27 per cent of the fuel excise that road users pay goes to road funding. This compares with 66.6 per cent of the revenue collected from fuel excise that went to road funding in 1983-84, the year before the Labor Government came into office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a decade now the Government has neglected to provide sufficient funds for the maintenance and upgrading of the Australian road network. The motorists of Australia will not be fooled by the latest increase in road funding by the Government. If Labor has the chance, it will again cut funding, as it has in the past. It is quite apparent that this Government does not care much about roads, except when it comes to an election year. It has allowed roads to deteriorate over the last decade. It cares about roads only in an election year&mdash;and it does not look as though it will win this election anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By not extending the functions of the NRTC to include the determination of charges for light vehicles, the Government has assured us that it will continue taxing motorists blind, regardless of whether those revenues go towards road funding. The coalition has made it clear that it will maintain the current level of road funding and that it will be funded from Consolidated Revenue. The whole Fightback package, of course, is totally funded, which cannot be said for the One Nation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NRTC has attempted to do its best to work around the constraints that have been put on it by the Government. The Liberal and National parties were concerned when the legislation was first introduced that the Commission was not given a wide enough range of powers to consider existing taxes that road transport pays. The Commission has basically gone ahead and done some of these things, to the vindication of the coalition, and looked at taxation issues anyway. We are pleased to see that the NRTC will have the power to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of road authorities. This was something that the Liberal and National parties were concerned about right from the beginning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other concern was that the Commission be able to assess the taxes and road related charges that have applied to light vehicles. This would allow for a more uniform and ideal charging system to be applied to this area of the industry. However, the Government has continued to withhold this power from the Commission and constrains its effectiveness in this area. Many commentators&mdash;in particular, the Australian Automobile Association&mdash;have argued with the coalition that light vehicles be included under the Commission's brief because it is difficult to determine a sensible and uniform charging system as long as the light vehicles are excluded. The Automobile Association supports the legislation but again, as with the Liberal and National parties, is disappointed that the constraints on the Commission remain in place. Clearly, the coalition has led the debate on this issue that has brought about the legislation before us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will take further steps towards providing fair and equitable taxes for Australian motorists. For too long now, the road users of this country have been milked for taxes to pay for the Government's failed economic policies. The coalition intends to abolish seven other taxes on business in addition to the general revenue tax that the Government highlights as a notional charge&mdash;in other words, the fuel excise levy goes. Three other taxes that impact directly on the road transport industry and motorists are the wholesale sales tax, payroll tax and customs duty. This will save the road transport industry hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Furthermore, in the first term of a coalition government, there will be no new road user charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This point has to be made clearly, because people such as the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) have been running around the place making all sorts of claims about this hidden tax that was to come out. The shadow Minister, Mr Hawker, has made an announcement that there will be no new road user charges in the first term of a coalition government. A typical road transport operator will save about $44,000 a year under the coalition compared with Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one considers its impact on the cost of goods, bearing in mind the size of Australia and the fact that we do transport goods and services over vast distances, one can realise the effect this will have on the cost of goods before they reach the retailer or the consumer. A six-axle articulated truck will pay $4,000 per year in registration&mdash;and that is all. There will be no federal fuel tax on business and there is no GST on registration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this is the critical difference between the tired, worn out and failed Labor Government which obviously has no policies whatsoever and the coalition with its Fightback plan. The coalition has a policy, as outlined in Fightback, to remove the fuel excise levy of 26c a litre. The reduction of 26c a litre will apply to every business across this nation. It represents a major reduction in business costs which will have profound multiplier effects, making business more competitive and, more importantly, leading to the creation of thousands of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take, for example, a simple thing such as a loaf of bread. The fertiliser delivered to the farmer will be in trucks which are sales tax free, driven by petrol which will be excise free. When the farmer's produce is taken to the market, it will be sales tax and fuel excise free. The primary product will be processed in factories where payroll tax will have been removed and by machinery which will not have import duty on it. When the final product is distributed it will be done sales tax and excise tax free to the retail outlet. The cascading effect of these savings will produce goods which are lower in cost, benefiting not only the exporters but, equally as important, those who compete against imports on the domestic market. If anything has driven the importance of that home, it is the figure released today of some $2 billion of current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there is no-one in society who does not agree that if we are to get this nation back on track, we must address the structural problems that have caused the economic crisis we are in. The only way to do that is to remove those taxes that those who supply goods into the Australian market do not pay but which our manufacturers, our secondary and tertiary processors, do have to pay. It is like putting them in a race with hobbles on to expect them to compete with importers. It is not a matter of goods coming from countries where there is cheap labour; it is a matter of our manufacturers and producers having to pay these input costs, under this Government, which make it impossible for them to compete on the domestic market. That is the major reason and the major basis for the Fightback program, and a major part of it is the total removal of the fuel excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, briefly, is the coalition policy. If the Government has a policy, I believe that this is an opportunity to spell it out to the people of Australia who have suffered so much under `the recession we had to have'. As I mentioned earlier today in this chamber in the debate on the urgency motion, it appears that the only thing the Government is offering is more of the same, and that is something that cannot be tolerated, as it would be a disaster for this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the introduction to my speech on this particular piece of legislation, I might just pick up on two things which Senator Parer has just said. Firstly, he mentioned the taxes which would be reduced under Fightback and, in particular, the payroll tax. Of course, Senator Parer would know very well, just as every other senator knows, that payroll tax is a State tax. I understand that Mr Kennett is already on record as saying that, given the plight of Victoria, he would be very loath to remove the payroll tax; and I would be very surprised if South Australia was interested in removing the payroll tax because of the parlous state of its economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue that Senator Parer was talking about was Australia's lack of competitiveness in relation to other countries because of the excise on petrol. I think Senator Parer should know as well as any other senator that of all the OECD countries, Australia has the third lowest petrol price and pays the second lowest rate of excise. I find it rather difficult to follow Senator Parer's logic if he suggests that that is a cause of our lack of competitiveness with respect to the other OECD countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Road Transport Commission Amendment Bill, which we are debating tonight, ratifies the Commonwealth-State agreement on light vehicles&mdash;not heavy vehicles&mdash;made on 11 May this year. The light vehicles agreement complements the heavy vehicles agreement made last year which instigated the development of nationally uniform road laws for vehicles over 4 1/2 tonnes. The light vehicles agreement recognises that there cannot be nationally uniform road laws for some vehicles and not for others. Again, this marks the difference between the Australian Democrats and the Opposition which wants to refer everything back to State legislation. We recognise that in this area it is very useful to have national roads laws, national registration and a single system by which these things are regulated right across the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, both these agreements&mdash;particularly the light vehicles agreement&mdash;ratified in this Bill fall far short of a truly national road law system. The heavy vehicles agreement has already demonstrated the inherent flaws in the new federalism process. National uniformity can only be gained by the enactment by the States and the Commonwealth of identical legislation covering their respective jurisdictions. If one government opts out, uniformity is lost. I stress again that that indicates the inherent flaw in the federalism line being pursued by both the Government and the Opposition in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already seen New South Wales refuse to accept the National Road Transport Commission's recommended heavy vehicle charges and announce that it will charge up to $3,000 extra for registration fees. The light vehicles agreement also requires the enactment of identical legislation in all jurisdictions to achieve national uniformity. However, it is a much less ambitious agreement than its heavy vehicles counterpart. It stops short of establishing a national car registration scheme, and it completely fails to introduce pay-as-you-drive road use charges for car owners, both of which would be absolutely in line with the declared market philosophy of the Opposition, but one which it fails to recognise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is despite the clear recommendations of the Interstate Commission in its 1990 report on road use charges and vehicle registration that there should be a national registration scheme with registration fees paid by way of increased petrol excise. It is despite more recent hints of support for such a system by the Minister for Resources, Mr Alan Griffiths, and also by the NRMA in New South Wales. No doubt the failure of the light vehicles agreement to lay the groundwork for a pay-as-you-drive national car registration scheme is due in no small part to the intransigence of the States and Territories. However, the Commonwealth is also responsible. It has failed totally to make a strong and public case for a measure which is squarely in the interests of Australia and Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats, in our Getting to Work program of economic reform, have costed a pay-as-you-drive&mdash;I stress that&mdash;national car registration scheme. Under our scheme the States would scrap car registration fees and compulsory third party insurance premiums. The same revenue&mdash;and I stress that, because it has been misrepresented repeatedly by the Opposition&mdash;which relates to car registration and third party insurance, of about $2.9 billion per year would be collected instead through the petrol pump. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We estimate that petrol excise would need to rise by 16.5c per litre to provide this $2.9 billion, which would then be channelled back to the States according to the agreed formula. In other words, it would be a completely revenue neutral procedure to do what the Opposition declares is the fundamental basis of its philosophy, namely, user pays&mdash;the proper and appropriate allocation of resources, which is at the basis of the market system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A formula would have to be found to accommodate private insurers in those States, such as New South Wales, in which they are allowed to offer compulsory third party policies. This could take the form of a rebate to those motorists wishing to take out a private policy. Preferably, it would allow private firms to receive a proportional amount of the petrol excise revenue for each motorist that they insure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advantages of such a scheme are obvious: drivers would pay road charges which were closely related to their actual road use, unlike the present system where one pays full charges even if one's car stays in the garage all year. Of course, many people buy a relatively larger car than they need because of the occasional use they make of that larger vehicle and are then forced to drive that vehicle all the time for purposes for which a much smaller car would be quite adequate, simply because they cannot afford to have a second smaller car and pay something like $600 to $800 per year in registration and third party insurance and simply leave that car in the garage. Under our proposal, the car which stayed in the garage would cost nothing while it was there; it would only cost something while it was being used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would also be impossible to evade registration and compulsory third party insurance charges. Every time one fills the tank, one pays. There would be no financial incentive to leave one's car unregistered. There would no longer be any point registering one's car in another State to avoid charges in one's own State because one would save precisely nothing. Instead of being hit with a bill amounting to several hundred dollars once a year, one's payments would be spread out, avoiding the household cash flow crisis which must affect many people who do not have large incomes, such as pensioners and other people who are in less pecunious circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would be a greater incentive to conserve petrol by driving less, buying more fuel efficient cars and switching to low emission fuels such as natural gas and LPG or petrol-ethanol blends as they become available. One must observe that the Opposition is already on record as saying that the abolition of petrol excise under its Fightback proposal would make the adoption of LPG completely uneconomical. In that connection one can only observe that Australia is very deficient in fuels from which we make petrol but has large amounts of LPG available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This conversion to alternative fuels would contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and we are the second or third world's worst in per capita greenhouse emissions. The road toll and the exorbitant cost of road accidents would also be reduced and our future oil import bill would be reduced. I would remind the Opposition that we currently import $3.1 billion worth of petroleum each year and that that amount will rise over time as we become less dependent. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not the point. The point is that, if we used less, we would be better off financially, and anybody with half a brain could see that that would be the situation. If we used less ourselves, we would have more to export, if that is the name of the game. With appropriate compensation schemes, drivers living in rural areas and on the urban fringe could also be protected from this impost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This last point deserves some elaboration. The Democrats believe that no pay-as-you-drive scheme should be introduced until a full social impact study has been performed to identify those motorists who would be unfairly penalised by increased petrol prices and compensation mechanisms put in place. In general, our scheme is fair and it is progressive, not like the regressive schemes of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Older people, young people and women who tend to drive smaller cars and drive shorter distances would be advantaged. Those who buy larger cars and drive greater distances would have to pay for their greater use of fossil fuel, for the pollution that it causes and for the damage occasioned to the roads. In other words, people on low incomes would generally pay less than people on higher incomes and less than they now pay under the fixed fee systems. For example, a pensioner driving a small car 2,000 kilometres per year would pay the equivalent of around $35 through the petrol pump for registration and compulsory third party insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several modes of compensation which could be targeted at farmers and those in rural areas and on the urban fringe. For instance, tax rebates similar to those now delivered to farmers and others using diesel fuel; adjusted benefits for social security recipients; or a petroleum products freight subsidisation scheme, which is already in place, which could also be used to reduce petrol prices in remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the worst efforts of the coalition to portray the scheme of the Democrats as a huge impost on rural people, in reality, rural people would have nothing to fear at all under our proposals. The coalition has made a great play of its proposal to abolish petrol excise and reduce prices by around 19c per litre and has contrasted its policy with ours in the usual irresponsible vote-buying fashion. However, as usual, it has deliberately and cynically misled the public about the true impact of its Fightback proposals. First, the coalition continually fails to acknowledge that we are the only party proposing to abolish all fixed car charges. Our scheme does not impose an additional impost; it replaces two old charges with a more responsible and equitable system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the coalition cannot bring itself to admit that for 70 per cent of Australian families, all in low and middle income brackets, the amount saved on petrol would be more than cancelled out by the overall cut in disposable income which Fightback would produce. What Dr Hewson giveth at the petrol pump, he taketh away in the supermarket. Thirdly, the coalition refuses to admit that its policy would cause a massive increase in petrol use, leading in turn to a blow-out in our oil import bill, increased greenhouse gas emissions and even greater health problems in our cities&mdash;a burden which is predominantly carried by Australian children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the coalition's policy is a sin of commission, Labor's policy is a sin of omission. It does not really want to encourage greater fuel use, but it has no policies to reduce it either. It is quietly sitting on the fence waiting for disaster to strike. I draw attention to Senator Button's replies to two of my questions last week. In one question I pointed out that 1,500 scientists, including 99 out of 198 living Nobel prize winning scientists, warned that we needed to address as a matter of urgency the problem of greenhouse. Senator Button said in answer to my question that the Government would not change its policy as a result of the urging by those scientists. On the very next day, when I pointed out the rising insurance costs, Senator Button again said that the Government would not change its policy because of rising insurance costs as a consequence of storm damage brought about by greenhouse climate change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Melbourne University's Professor Bruce Knox has found that over the last 30 years the incidence of asthma-like breathing problems among Melbourne school children has risen from 19 per cent to 46 per cent. Japanese research links asthma attacks with nitrogen oxides&mdash;a major component of car exhaust fumes. Other research, by Victoria's Environmental Protection Authority, suggests a link between benzene in exhaust fumes and Melbourne's unusual high incidence of acute myeloid leukemia. One could go on about other trace materials which occur in petrol, something which the Opposition seems to have no care about at all. The Opposition would increase the cost of public transport fares by 15 per cent, reduce the amount of government expenditure on public transport, as a consequence of reduced government expenditure in general, and at the same time reduce the price of petrol&mdash;all of which would make the air pollution problems in our major cities absolutely horrific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On current projections, smog levels in western Sydney are expected to rise by 50 per cent over the next 20 years. How much more will they rise under the coalition's policy? Has the coalition estimated the economic impact? I am sure it has not even begun to make a calculation of the air pollution impact of its changes in fuel prices. Has it run its computer models to predict exactly how many more children would contract respiratory disorders? I believe the answer is no, nor could it care, because it is looking purely at the bare economic indicators of production and consumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not care about the suffering its policies would cause to our young people and Labor does not care enough to do anything about it either. Only the Democrats care enough to act. According to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, oil production in Australian fields in 2005 will be 20 per below the 1988 demand. Unless we cut demand, the result will be billions of dollar per year spent on imported oil, adding to a debt for which Australians will ultimately pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition claims to support a 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2000. Its policy has been reduced to rubble by its plan to abolish petrol excise. Not only would this encourage wasteful driving and the purchase of gas guzzlers; but also it would strongly discourage the development of environmentally friendly alternative transport fuels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One Australian firm, Manildra Pty Ltd, has married environmental and economic concerns by converting starch mill effluent to ethanol, which it mixes with petrol and diesel in a 10 per cent ethanol blend. The petrol blend is being sold from seven south coast petrol stations and has won high consumer acceptance, while the diesel blend is being trialled in Action buses. Meanwhile, the APACE research team at the University of New South Wales has developed an exciting new technique to turn wood fibres from such sources as plantation thinnings or even woody weeds into ethanol and lignin. So there are many alternatives which could come on-line, all of which would be discouraged by the policies of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our policy of reducing and shifting car costs, from car ownership to car use, would have a substantial impact on petrol consumption as drivers took the opportunity to save fuel and bank the proceeds. According to the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics, the five-year fuel price elasticity for cars is minus 0.66. Against a base price of 70c per litre, this would result in a 15.6 per cent cut in greenhouse gas emissions from car use before the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's policies, by contrast, would cause greenhouse gas emissions from cars to rise by 17.9 per cent. Labor's sit-on-the-fence policies will do nothing one way or the other. Labor has absolutely no intention of reducing our future import bill and our greenhouse gas emissions, and the coalition is hell-bent on increasing them. Only the Democrats intend to fulfil our obligations to ourselves and our children. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main purpose of the National Road Transport Commission Amendment Bill is to give effect to the light vehicles agreement which came out of the meeting of the heads of government on 11 May 1992. It mainly involves bringing vehicles that are 4 1/2 tonnes or less into the orbit of the NRTC and includes drivers and other road users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal functions that were given to the NRTC when it was set up late last year were to inquire and recommend on a number of matters including:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)uniform Heavy Vehicle legislation;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)road charges and road use charges;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(vii)Applications Orders (ie, orders by a Minister which would suspend the operation of the applicable road legislation in a particular zone).</PARA>
<PARA>Those functions have been around for quite a few months and the Commission's functions are now being extended to include light vehicles, the assembly and publication of information on road related charges applying to light vehicles, assistance in developing indicators for assessing the performance of the road system and matters related to that performance and, most importantly, the assembly and publication of information on road safety and the monitoring of the use of alternate fuels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has already been pointed out by Senator Parer, the Opposition is supporting these measures, though I have a few reservations. The NRTC will be given responsibility for the development of light vehicles but will not determine the charges, as has been already pointed out. When the NRTC started on 1 January, it had control over everything other than that and now intends to bring that in. Of course, the standard recommendation on charges does not come in until 1995, even though there are some recommended charges in place.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Fightback package of the coalition in government, there will be no road user charge on that basis until 1 January 1996; of course, it may be on a different basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I support the uniform standards&mdash;I have always supported uniform standards in speed limitations or mass limits&mdash;I have been hesitant to accept the recommended charges. The reason is&mdash;I have listened to industry and users around Australia&mdash;that costs, as I have said before, bear heaviest on those in rural and remote areas. These are areas that do not necessarily have the luxury of competition. The roads in those places are far worse than the roads in the metropolitan areas or the areas that are adjacent to them. The freight tonnages vary as loading on both legs of the journey happens in very few cases; mostly, transporters are loaded on only one leg of the journey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New South Wales is still opposing the charges because it believes that road funding to it will decrease. However, Western Australia is opposing the charges because of its fears about the effect the increases will have on the rural and remote areas. New South Wales is in the unfortunate position of being a corridor State with a lot of traffic, and trucks not registered in that State, using its roads from north to south. I quite understand its concerns, but I appeal to it to look at the idea that, with uniform charging, trucks should come back and be licensed in New South Wales so it will pick up its fair share of registration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Western Australia a lot of concessions are available. I have a list here, which I will not go through in my limited time this evening, but I have not seen any specific indication that some of those concessions are going to remain in place, though it is the prerogative of the State governments to determine that, and I am sure that Western Australia will agree in time to the uniform charges and uniform conditions. Western Australia has always agreed to uniform speeds and masses, but not the charges. When it does agree to them, I am sure it will look at the idea of concessions in certain restricted areas. I am the first to say that there are a lot of concessions available that should not necessarily be there. At present, Western Australia has concessions on trucks of up to 18-tonne capacity and on light vehicles used by farmers or in areas adjacent to the farms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the coalition supports the Bill. Initially the coalition opposed the measures because of the lack of wide reference powers to consider existing taxes on transport. There is a lack of power to scrutinise the supply of roads. The Government is looking only at the demand-side evidence that road making is inefficient. Many organisations want the NRTC to include light vehicles. The Australian Automobile Association, for instance, wants that and has asked for the NRTC to take over the design rules. It has also asked for increased frequency, probably for safety of road worthiness checks. Some States, including Western Australia, do not have checks on safety and road worthiness regularly. Of course, this agreement does not extend to the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until all parties have passed the legislation, what is the future of the Federal Office of Road Safety? It seems to have an undefined role at the present moment. I believe that it should stay, but it should have an advisory role only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I can get back to the NRTC and to reviewing tax and transport, this Government is still dodging the issue. We get red herrings such as there being no database to find out what taxes there are. The former Prime Minister&mdash;I read this somewhere as late as tonight&mdash;has admitted that road transport was taxed 3 1/2 times more than any other industry, yet the Government does not seem to recognise this fact. I know that the former Prime Minister was prone to saying things off the top of his head, but I do not think even he would have made such an incorrect statement if it were not somewhere near correct. I wish that the NRTC and the Government would stop using as a red herring the fact that there is no database to say that that information is not available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the proposal of the coalition, on coming into government, an inquiry will be conducted into the taxes paid by the road industry, and that will be reflected in the road user charge coming in in 1996. The shadow Minister, Mr David Hawker, is on record as having said this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are supporting this legislation. The coalition will lessen the load on the road transport sector before 1996 which is when uniform charges, as recommended by the new committee, will be introduced. Many of the taxes will come off on 1 October 1994, such as the 26c per litre. I believe that the big winners will then be road transport and, of course, those people that use its services. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate to support the very worthwhile and clear comments of my colleagues Senator Parer and Senator Panizza in this debate. It is always a pleasure to follow people such as Senator Parer and Senator Panizza, who have a real understanding of what life is all about, particularly life out there in the real world&mdash;the world which produces Australia's wealth and which is made up of real people, doing real jobs and creating real wealth for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I was listening to the debate&mdash;not very intently after Senator Parer sat down&mdash;I heard what I assumed was someone from the Labor Party speaking. I thought that it was just some more of the old class-conscious, extreme, left wing claptrap that we are used to expecting from the Labor Party. It went on, and I realised that it was not someone from the Labor Party; it was the dulcet tones of the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Coulter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter went on with stuff that I think even the Labor Party gave away some 20 years ago: the sort of divisive arguments about ideological claptrap&mdash;that is all it can be called&mdash;such as separating the city from the country, which used to imprison the Labor Government; it still does to a certain extent. Mr Keating was most intent on introducing a consumption tax in 1985. Of course he was captured and imprisoned by the left wing of his Party; he was not allowed to do it. He now has to suffer the hypocrisy of speaking against the proposal for a consumption tax which he so roundly supported just a few years ago. But I have diverted from my comments on Senator Coulter's quite unbelievable contribution to this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter made a speech full of inaccuracies. I intend to highlight just a few of them before getting on with what I want to say about the National Road Transport Commission Amendment Bill. Firstly, Senator Coulter suggested that Mr Kennett was on record as saying that he would not remove payroll tax because Mr Kennett needed the money. It just shows how little of our proposal Senator Coulter has understood. He has not bothered to read it or, if he has, he simply cannot understand it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our proposals regarding payroll tax are very clear; even a six-year-old could understand them. We intend to say to the States, `If you abolish payroll tax, we will compensate you for it'. If a State Government does not want to remove payroll tax&mdash;and we will not force it to&mdash;it will not get compensated. Of course, every State Government will abolish its payroll tax very willingly. Out of the funds that we will collect&mdash;and it is all costed and accounted for in Fightback&mdash;we will compensate the States for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter spoke at some length about OECD countries. He forgot to mention that, of all OECD countries, Australia probably has the biggest need for road transport and vehicles that use fuel, because Australia is such a vast and widely spread country. Senator Coulter seemed to quite conveniently overlook that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then went on with a quite amazing `pay as you drive' proposal. He said that the Australian Democrats would abolish all taxes on vehicles, driving, fuel, registration, road user charges, et cetera, but collect it from the petrol pump by charging an additional 16.5c per litre on top of existing petrol costs. That is how the Democrats will supposedly fund road maintenance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have any personal ill will towards Senator Coulter, so on that basis I will give him a warning: please never come up my way. I know that he has been to Queensland peddling some of his quite idiotic policies on other issues, but now that he has said that he wants the people of North Queensland to pay an extra 16.5c per litre for their fuel, I say to him, `Please do not go there, the people of Queensland will lynch you'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Coulter goes to Mount Isa and tells the locals that he will add 16.5c per litre on top of what they are already paying for fuel&mdash;as opposed to our proposal to remove 26c from what they are currently paying&mdash;they will lynch him. I do not bear him any personal ill will, so I send him the warning: please do not go to Queensland again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is okay if, like Senator Coulter, one lives in Adelaide. To go from one point to another anywhere in Adelaide is 20 or 30 kilometres at the most. If people want to see a specialist, go to the theatre or some of the major shops to do some shopping, they have to drive 20 to 30 kilometres at the most to get there, and it does not cost much in petrol. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one is paying the price for fuel that one currently pays, plus an extra 16.5c per litre, it will cost an enormous amount just to take one's kids to see the specialist, to school, to the theatre, to the ballet or to some other cultural performance. All those things which are a natural part of life where I, Senator Panizza and other people in remote and rural Australia live would cost a lot extra if Senator Coulter's proposals were ever to be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that no-one will ever take anything that Senator Coulter says seriously. My only fear, and the reason I raise it, is that the more he goes on with that sort of rubbish the more the Government&mdash;which gets anxious for money; it has a $50 billion hole to make up in its Budget over the next few years&mdash;is encouraged to look at those sorts of things. Already this Government collects 26c a litre in tax on fuel. Only about 6c or 7c a litre of that goes towards roads. The balance&mdash;about 20c a litre&mdash;is a pure tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of the people where I live and where Senator Panizza lives pay their income tax, the same as everyone else in Australia. On top of that, we pay an extra 20c for every litre of fuel we use that goes to the general revenue. That is okay if we live in Brisbane or Adelaide and we can use public transport or drive just 10 kilometres to go to the specialist, to department stores or to the theatre&mdash;to do the normal things of life. But when one has to drive 200, 300 or 400 kilometres to do that, it is a real impost. It is very unfair and discriminatory against country dwellers that they have to pay 20c a litre for the general revenue&mdash;a 20c a litre tax&mdash;just for the privilege of living in those areas. Senator Coulter would have them pay an extra 16.5c a litre on top of that. I say to Senator Coulter: please do not go to North Queensland or to Western Australia because the people there will lynch you if you do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter then went on to make some silly comment about LPG. We are not putting up the price of LPG. We are not adding any taxes to it. We are leaving it exactly as it is. We are simply removing the fuel excise from petrol and diesel. Senator Coulter then made what can only described as some typical Democrat statements. He started to equivocate, saying, `We are going to have this 16.5c a litre tax, but we will probably have a social impact study as well'&mdash;whatever that means; it is one of these Public Service, left-wing terms&mdash;`and if it impacts upon country people, we will probably do something; we will probably give some tax rebates or compensate them for it in some way'. He does not tell us how. He does not say what would then happen to the hole in the Budget that that sort of thing would create. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, no-one takes any notice of what the Democrats say. My only fear is that, by raising these sorts of things, this Government&mdash;desperate for money as it is&mdash;is likely to take up those sorts of issues knowing that it will get the support of the Australian Democrats. I have almost taken up my time pointing out just some of the inaccuracies and stupidities of the issues that Senator Coulter raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I very quickly wish to indicate, as my colleagues have done, that we are supporting this Bill for the reasons that Senator Parer has mentioned. In spite of the continuing campaign of misinformation being carried on by the Labor Party, particularly the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in this case, we will not be introducing a road user charge in the first term of the Hewson government. We will be slashing transport costs completely. The Liberal and National parties have no new road user charges. A typical road transport operator will save about $44,000 per year under the coalition compared with what is currently paid. This will feed into cheaper prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my role as the Liberal-National coalition spokesman for local government, I must say that that is a factor that local governments are very keen on. They understand that all of their trucking contractors, and there are a lot of those in local government, will be able to provide councils with much cheaper tender costs because all of those taxes that the truckie-type contractors currently pay&mdash;the fuel tax and the sales tax at 20 per cent on their trucks, tyres, windscreens and spare parts&mdash;will go. For the big fellows, the payroll tax will go, the training guarantee levy will go, and the superannuation guarantee will be pegged. So contractors will have substantially reduced costs: in the instance I cited, $44,000 for a 500 horsepower articulated rig. With that sort of saving, they can make real reductions in the cost of their businesses and a reduction in the tenders that they offer to councils and other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the coalition there will be real benefits and real cost reductions for the transport industry. Those benefits and cost reductions will of course flow on to our exports and our means of production. It is a great policy and something that will give a much needed boost to the trucking industry and to those sectors of the Australian economy which produce. In contrast, the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats want only to penalise the trucking industry and the productive sector and use them as a milch cow. The coalition is doing something about it. I am very pleased to be part of a team which has put forward such a far-sighted policy. I support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Macdonald has explained in detail in the last few moments, this evening we have seen the Australian Democrats in their true colours as far as their policies are concerned. Over the last few months we have seen various Democrat senators running around rural South Australia feigning sympathy for rural people; feigning sympathy for farmers who currently find themselves in a disastrous plight because of a combination of dreadful policies from the present Labor Government, a downturn in commodity prices and, in some respects, because of poor seasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That combination of factors, which as I said is, in part, the direct responsibility of this Labor Government, has seen many rural people left in a parlous situation. The Democrats have been running around feigning sympathy for these people and saying that Democrat policies will be of support to them. Yet tonight&mdash;and in fact earlier than that&mdash;we heard the Democrats, on the other hand, advocating a massive increase in fuel tax. They advocate an additional tax of 16c or so a litre. So the Democrats are telling people out in the electorate one thing and they come into this chamber, where they think people are not listening&mdash;as the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) acknowledges too&mdash;and say something completely different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in the advocacy of this policy, they fail to recognise that Australia is a country of extremely long distances. Australia is a very large country with a relatively small population, separated by long distances. It is a country in which transport makes up a much higher proportion of the costs of goods in general than is the case in most other countries. That is because, in part, we have an excessive amount of taxation on the road transport industry, including fuel tax. Yet, as we have seen tonight, the Democrats are advocating an additional tax of 16c a litre, which would be an absolute disaster for people living in rural and isolated parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Democrats were to come to the electorate of Grey in the far north of South Australia and tell people that that is their policy, all the feigning in the world with regard to their sympathy for the disastrous situation in which rural people find themselves would be to no avail. They will have no support whatsoever. They would not be welcome in most of the other larger States with this sort of policy. I think it is incumbent on our side of politics&mdash;and it is even incumbent on the Government side of politics&mdash;to make the community at large aware of this ridiculous approach to taxation, and to road transport in particular, advocated by the Democrats. As I have said, if they come to Grey&mdash;which covers some 87 per cent of South Australia&mdash;and spout that nonsense we need have no fear of their winning any votes in that electorate because it is particularly dependent on road transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These comments have been made in the context of the debate this evening on the National Road Transport Commission Amendment Bill 1992, which the Opposition will not oppose. It seeks to provide a number of minor amendments to the Road Transport Commission Bill that was passed about a year ago. The major purpose of this legislation is to insert as a schedule to the Act an agreement which was reached earlier this year between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and a number of State Premiers. That agreement, signed by all States and Territories except Western Australia and Tasmania, arose from the urgent need to establish uniform standards for heavy vehicles to replace the differing rules that had existed in the various jurisdictions throughout Australia. This action has been long overdue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition strongly opposed the initial National Road Transport Commission legislation which was passed at about this time last year, because we believed that legislation did not give the newly established Road Transport Commission sufficiently wide reference powers to consider the existing taxes that road transport pays. We believe that, under this legislation, some of those reservations which we previously had have been in part, although not completely, addressed. Again, of course, the prevalence of those existing taxes on road transport simply brings into focus the idiocy of the Australian Democrats in proposing that yet another 16.5c a litre be added to the already heavy taxes that exist on fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that the National Road Transport Commission will now have the power to help assess the performance of the road system and the efficiency and effectiveness of road authorities. That is certainly a long way down the track that we are advocating from the initial steps that were taken last year when the Government established this new Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also my understanding that groups such as the Australian Automobile Association have urged all governments to include light vehicles in the Commission's brief. They support our view that it is wellnigh impossible to determine a sensible road charging and funding regime without their inclusion. The Australian Automobile Association also agrees that roadworthiness checks cost more than they are worth and, with its experience, particularly in regard to private passenger motor vehicles, it ought to know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that this Government has overburdened road users with a plethora of road use requirements and administrivia, which, according to the experts on general road use, do not significantly reflect a very wise use of taxpayer funding. Although I understand that the amendment in this legislation proposes to insert the May agreement into the Road Transport Commission Act 1991, and although the agreement provides the framework for uniform minimum standards in respect of light vehicles, it does not impose such standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The functions of the National Road Transport Commission are not to be extended to road charges or economic regulation of the entire industry. It is clear that the Government did not want to lose its influence over the exorbitant taxation which it continues to levy on motorists and the road transport industry, so it is really not overly serious about coming to grips with an ideal charging system. It is unfortunate that, at a time of deep recession when we need to reform our cost structures, the present Labor Government will not act to slash the cost of road transport as the Liberal and National parties will do when we come into government through the initiatives in our Fightback proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under a Hewson coalition government, there will be no new road user charges beyond those that are in the process of being implemented. As a result, a typical road transport operator will save nearly $44,000 per year under a coalition government compared with the cost of operating under the present government. That is largely due to our commitment to completely abolish fuel excise. That will save road transport users 26c a litre. That is an enormous saving when one considers the quantity of fuel which is used by major transport operators. By comparison, the Government is proposing road user charges of $4,000 for a typical truck, plus the continuation of those massive fuel charges of 26c a litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key areas of this Bill concern the establishment of a national uniform legislation for light vehicles, that is, 4 1/2 tonnes and under, and for other road users, but it does not include road charges or any economic regulation of the transport industry. On the issue of light vehicle regulation, the Bill leaves open the opportunity for the National Road Transport Commission to have the power to decide Australian design rules and the frequency of safety and roadworthiness checks. The amending legislation also concerns an expansion of National Road Transport Commission powers, but the Commission remains hamstrung by this Govern-ment's not including any recommendations on road funding in this amending Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presently the functions of the Commission are concerned with obtaining uniformity in road transport, yet that applies only to heavy vehicles, that is, those vehicles of more than 4 1/2 tonnes. These functions relate to uniform legislation, road charges and road user charges, principles for determining road charges and road use charges, and guidelines for the preparation of regulatory impact statements. The additional functions conferred on the Commission by the May agreement between the Prime Minister and various State premiers include the extension of the Commission's functions to light vehicles, the assembly and publication of information on the road related charges applying to light vehicles, and the monitoring of the use of alternative fuels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the coalition still has strong objections to the manner in which the Government handled the setting up of the National Road Transport Commission, basically the Commission will now at least be collecting information and statistics on differing charging regimes. This is certainly something that is long overdue. It is a shame that this present Government did not have the fortitude to go all the way and benefit the entire industry as a Hewson-led Liberal-National Party government will, in fact, do. The coalition will certainly not tax to death the road transport industry and, unlike the present Government, it will significantly cut costs with regard to the road transport industry, which even the Prime Minister has admitted has for long paid 3 1/2 times more tax than other industries. The Government's own Inter-State Commission recommended a reduction in the tax burden but, again, the present Government failed to implement that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to ensuring that the costs of road transport are substantially reduced, a Hewson government will maintain existing levels of road funding provided from Consolidated Revenue. So there are a number of initiatives which the coalition will take which will improve the operation of road transport in this country. We will reduce significantly the cost of road transport. We will maintain road funding to ensure that there is adequate provision of roads and we will certainly overcome a decade of neglect under this present Government. They are initiatives which Australia desperately needs because, as I said at the outset, road transport in particular makes up a major cost of production in Australia, a major share of the cost of goods, and, if we are going to be internationally competitive, we certainly need to reduce those costs. Although, as I said, we support this legislation, we do so with those caveats and reservations on the lack of initiative on the part of the present Government, which will be addressed by the next government elected, a coalition government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the remarks of my colleagues on the National Road Transport Commission Amendment Bill. I wish to talk about a number of aspects of the Bill from a Western Australian perspective, Western Australia being my home State. In terms of area, it is the largest State in Australia. It also has the greatest task in terms of transport, particularly when it comes to the grain industry, the wool industry and the mining industry. Transport, whether by road or its competitor, rail,  is of enormous significance to Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of what I wish to say tonight has already been said by my colleagues, but some of it bears repeating. As I have already mentioned, the major problem with our transport industry in Western Australia, and our road transport industry in particular, is excessive taxing. The principal taxes are payroll tax, fuel excise and wholesale sales tax. Under this Government, these charges have increased consistently, particularly fuel excise and wholesale sales tax. Whether it be carting minerals, stock, grain or anything else that is required, we find that those industries are significantly disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw some of the most ludicrous things being done with stock carting in the amendments to the Sales Tax Act. If a stock crate was fastened to either a truck or a trailer that was being towed, it was exempt from sales tax. But if that stock crate was not part of the truck or trailer, sales tax is paid. It is really incomprehensible that a government could have such anomalies in charging a tax; namely, the wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, when in government, will adopt a very different position. We will remove that anomaly by virtue of the fact that wholesale sales tax will go completely. In addition, fuel excise will go completely, as will payroll tax. I recently discussed the matter of transport with three companies which operate in the road transport area in Western Australia. Their payroll tax bill was in excess of $500,000, which gives us some idea of the impact this tax has on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now refer to the taxing of this industry. I am personally involved in grain growing and producing wool and meat for market, whether it be cattle or mutton. Under the coalition policy the saving will be in the order of $1.20 to $1.30 per tonne. When that is added up, there are many thousands of dollars of savings for a typical Western Australian farm. One of the most important things about our ability to compete&mdash;some of our ability to compete was blown out of the water today by the irresponsible national strike, which was led by the ACTU&mdash;is to keep our costs down so that, when we sell our product internationally, we have an opportunity to maximise our penetration of various markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the coalition's plan, which is to change the taxing arrangements which apply to our road transport industry, there will be a direct flow-off to the rail system in Western Australia: payroll tax, fuel excise and wholesale sales tax will go. In addition to that, setting grain freights in Western Australia is done by what is known as a grain freights contract. That is established because Westrail in Western Australian is in a monopoly position in many of the transport areas. It is a fact that there is competition between the two as a defacto result of this contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of the Liberal and National parties' transport policies and the removal of these taxes will flow through directly into the rail system. It will also create a reduction in costs of $1.20 to $1.40 per tonne. That will flow directly back to the producers of the various products which are carted on Westrail, giving them the same advantages. While this Bill is about the National Road Transport Commission, it has a much broader impact and effect than on just the transport industry. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the remaining few minutes I have to address this Bill, I would like to comment on what Senator Coulter, the Leader of the Australian Democrats, said tonight about increasing fuel excise by 16.5c per litre. If that were put into place&mdash;if the Democrats could ever possibly attain power in this country, and heaven forbid that particular occurrence&mdash;it would mean that fuel excise, the direct tax by the Federal government, would increase to in excess of 40c per litre. That would put much of Western Australia right out of business. It would certainly mean that our iron ore industry could not compete with Brazil and countries such as that. It would certainly mean that our grain industry, in particular, and our livestock industry, in addition, would almost cease to exist, if that sort of cost burden were put on them. </PARA>

Imposing the types of charges that Senator Coulter has suggested tonight would certainly increase that by 10 to 15 per cent and maybe even more.

<PARA>He was, of course, referring to the tyranny of distance which then, as now, was one of the greatest challenges faced by Australians seeking to explore and expand into the inland portions of our continent. In the time that has elapsed, that problem has changed very little. It is the enormous difficulty of transporting produce from the areas of regional Australia where it is produced and the cost and the difficulty of bringing consumer items out to regional Australia which are the major impediments to the further development of regional Australia and the further improvement of the  opportunities of people who live in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Road Transport Commission Amendment Bill, addressing, as it does, the issues of national road regulations and national road user charges, is a perfect opportunity to discuss those very important issues and the impact that they have on the lives of the people who live outside our capital cities. As I have said before in this chamber&mdash;and it is no news to honourable senators on this side of the chamber&mdash;80 per cent of this nation's merchandised export earnings are produced by the one in six Australians who live outside the capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to get regional development, if we are to expand industry outside those few cities that scatter the eastern shores of this country, it is absolutely critical that we are able to make genuine improvements in the cost of transport. The cost of transport is a major problem for industries wishing to start up in regional Australia because it means that every single item, every single business input, that gets transported there is hit with the cost of road transport. The more the cost of road transport increases, the more difficult it becomes to generate new industries outside the cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For these reasons, those of us on this side of the chamber in the National and Liberal parties are firmly committed to the abolition of fuel tax. That means a reduction in the operating costs for road transport users of some 26.2c a litre on every single litre of fuel that they use, diesel or petrol. It means an end to the burden of enormous transport costs on developing industries in regional Australia. It means a start to the end of the enormous differences that currently exist between those who live within the cities and those who do not. This is some 2 1/2 years after the first report of the Inter-State Commission came out, the so-called Butcher committee, which recommended massive increases in road user charges. The Government was initially quite willing to support that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the National Party, my colleague Senator Boswell and I, who first took up the issue of the Inter-State Commission's report and who first went around regional Australia and said, `Look what will happen to industry in regional Australia if this report is allowed to be put into place'. That is why we were committed then, and we are committed now, to reducing road transport charges throughout this country. I am very pleased to see that the Government recognised the sense of what we were saying and recognised&mdash;to the credit of some of the people who sit on the other side of the chamber&mdash;that if we are to even out the inequalities that currently exist between people who live in different parts of this country we have to reduce the cost of road transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask honourable senators: why is it that in this country industry is concentrated in a few centres whereas in other countries&mdash;for example, the United States&mdash;industry exists in small towns from one end of the country to the other? The reason for that disparity, of course, is the enormous cost of road transport in Australia which penalises industries that wish to set up outside the major capital cities. Therefore, what we must do, if we are to achieve the full potential of this nation, is to reduce the cost of road transport. That is why we in the National Party are particularly pleased to see that the Fightback package picked up our initiative of the abolition of fuel tax and, on top of that, the abolition of the 20 per cent wholesale sales tax which is currently on the transport industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise the entry into the chamber of my Senate leader, Senator Ron Boswell, who, as I said, was so instrumental in getting the commitment of the coalition to keep road user charges down. It is particularly important because that is a commitment that we will take to the electorate in this election campaign&mdash;that after the election there will be no increase in road user charges for heavy vehicles. That is a commitment that those who sit opposite us in this chamber cannot make and have refused to make time and time again. It is not that they have not been challenged to; it is that they cannot make that commitment because they do not have the necessary commitment to developing regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what we are saying on this side is that we offer an alternative to the continued decline of regional Australia; we offer an alternative to the decline of primary industry which has been massively hit by enormous road user charges&mdash;and that is an alternative which will reduce the cost of transport and make feasible again processing and value-adding industries in regional Australia. Most importantly, it is a policy that recognises that a road that goes from the coast to somewhere in inland Queensland does not exist just for the benefit of the people in inland Queensland on one end of it, but that it is of benefit to all Queenslanders, especially when it is used to get our important exports to the coast where they can be shipped overseas to turn around this nation's balance of payments problem. That is why we have a commitment to fund the road system out of the Consolidated Revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask honourable senators, and I ask those who may be listening to this telecast, to compare that approach with the approach that is offered by the Government. What is the approach offered by the Government? It is an approach that says, `We are ripping something like $6,500m a year out of road users in this country through the fuel tax, and we are returning about one-quarter of that amount of money to the roads system'. </PARA>

How can we, as senators who represent our States, face our constituents with clear consciences when we go into regional Australia if we allow policies to continue that penalise the people who live outside the capital cities? That is why those of us in the coalition are absolutely committed to ending fuel tax and ending what is, in fact, a tax on people who live outside our major cities. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point is that the coalition in a statement issued by its shadow Minister, the honourable member for Wannon, on Thursday 29 October, made it very clear indeed that the road user charges it is talking about agreeing to will in fact apply only in the first term of a coalition government, leaving wide open the question as to what happens after that.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the startled interjections opposite, I will tell the Senate. In the Fightback document, the coalition commits itself to full cost recovery of the safety regulatory charges as they impose on the general aviation industry. Just recently I drew attention to that matter in Question Time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has been pursued for some time by the peak bodies which represent the light aircraft industry and the general aviation industry. It took the coalition a very considerable time&mdash;about six months&mdash;to realise that more than 90 per cent of the fuel excise which is collected on avgas is remitted immediately to the Civil Aviation Authority in direct payment for the services it provides to the general aviation industry. Of course, the coalition was blissfully unaware of that. Having been pursued by the light aircraft peak bodies, the coalition has recently replied to them and told them, in direct contradiction of the policy statement in the Fightback document, that it will be funding the safety regulatory costs to the light aircraft industry from general revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an indication as to how the National Party tail can certainly wag the dog when it is convenient, because it raises the question of just how flexible and changeable this Fightback policy document is. That immediately opens up yet another hole&mdash;albeit a small one compared with the holes in the coalition's defence policy, for example; but a hole nevertheless&mdash;of $23m in the Fightback document in respect of the removal of fuel excise from the aviation industry. It is a matter of some concern to me when I see that these commitments are limited in terms of their effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other curious point is that, in a speech to the NTF conference in September this year, Dr Hewson said:</PARA>

<PARA>that is the money collected by the road user charge&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>I find that curious because, one month later when the coalition finally enunciated its policy on road user charges with an attachment that set the maximum charges per vehicle, the honourable member for Wannon clarified the charges that the coalition would introduce. He said, `A six-axle articulated truck will pay $4,000 a year in registration. That is all'. Interestingly, less than a month before, the Leader of the Opposition made it clear that the road user charges, which were then being finally considered by the coalition and announced by the honourable member for Wannon, `will free up that money and have that money available for further cuts in taxation in other areas'. </PARA>

If the State revenues are collected by a Federal Liberal government then, interestingly, to make up the difference the States will no doubt increase their own fuel franchise fees&mdash;or, as they call them in the Northern Territory, business franchise fees, to pretend that they do not actually charge a local excise on fuel.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating cognately Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1992, Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 and Sales Tax Imposition (In Situ Pools) Bill 1992. The first Bill, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1992, will bring significant changes to and introduce the concept of offshore banking regulations. There will be changes to the capital gains tax regime, particularly to the notorious terrible twins M6 and M7, and there will be changes to the penalties for late payment of tax and changes to the disability support pension, bereavement payments and changes to the textile clothing and footwear special allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new term is `offshore banking'. This refers broadly to the intermediation by a resident institution of financial transactions between non-residents and non-resident lenders. An offshore banking unit or an OBU, as it is more commonly referred to, is the unit within the bank that manages these transactions. Under existing Australian law, an OBU may also borrow from residents in foreign countries but its lending is restricted to non-residents and other OBUs&mdash;and this is the significant feature of an OBU transaction. We might recall that in the Prime Minister's One Nation statement earlier this year the Government announced its intention to tax income derived by offshore banking units from borrowing and lending to non-residents at the concessional company income tax rate of only 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, it was decided after extensive consultation with the banking and finance industry to extend the scope of these activities, the income of which would attract the concessional rate. When this Bill was first released, it caused a number of submissions from the industry pointing out the anomalies and inadequacies especially with a number of stated objectives. The Government believes that this Bill will promote the development of a viable offshore banking centre in Australia at a time when activities are likely to be shifted from Hong Kong to elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region as well as helping to integrate Australia more closely with the Asia-Pacific growth economies by becoming the expanded financial centre of the region. The Opposition supports this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am happy to say that the Government has listened in part to a number of the submissions given to it on this Bill and has introduced and circulated further amendments during the debate in the lower House as well as in the Senate only recently. I am also pleased that the Government consulted with several sections of the industry. The Australian Taxation Office and the banking industry met on several occasions to discuss the proposed overseas banking unit legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it has been brought to my attention that in order for an OBU to operate in the most efficient manner a number of small issues still need attention. In order to manage foreign currency trading positions, it is vital that the overseas banking units be allowed to deal with a domestic banking unit or DBU at market rates. The industry has informed me that without this ability to deal between the OBU and the domestic banking unit it is unlikely that the banking industry will be inclined to place significant amounts of business within the OBU. For example, the domestic banking unit would be allowed to trade US dollars and Japanese yen with the overseas banking unit. For this purpose, the bank's treasury division must be considered separate from the overseas banking unit and allowed to trade with the overseas banking unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A potential for tax avoidance could arise; however I believe that the case for separation is substantial. The explanatory memorandum clearly states that an OBU is to be treated as if it is a separate bank. Further, section 121C of the legislation allows internal deals between the overseas banking unit and a foreign branch of the same bank. Therefore, to allow the OBU to deal with the domestic banking unit would merely be an extension of the principle to allow for internal deals between the overseas banking unit and the Australian branch of the same bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition intends to move an amendment at the committee stage. We apologise that the initial amendment that was issued related to the second printing and since that time a third printing has been presented to the other chamber. The Opposition will be pursuing only the first amendment, to enable this offset to be made. Without the amendment, the overseas banking unit would not be in a position to offset a currency exposure on a transaction with a non-resident with a hedge taken locally to offset that risk. It is, therefore, an incentive to transact that business in Australia. The Tax Office could be at an auditing disadvantage, particularly if that sort of business were conducted in Singapore, because the secrecy provisions in the banking legislation preclude the passing on of information in respect of a transaction in and out of Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, the Australian bank must hedge its position back to Australian dollars. A bank could suffer currency risks where it is unable to efficiently manage because of differing tax rules for the OBU versus the domestic banking unit. Therefore, the final Australian dollar hedge will have to be undertaken within the main bank where the OBU has the underlying currency exposure and the main bank has the matching hedge. Each has an exposed position. The logical solution is to permit the overseas banking unit to enter into a hedge with the main bank, the result of the hedge being to close out the exposed position of each of the OBUs and the main bank and to return them both to a fully hedged position. Profit shifting or avoidance schemes will not result. I think this is the fear that the Tax Office had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum states that the level of penalties associated with the new self-assessment provision will apply where profit shifting has occurred between classes of income with different taxing rights. Under this regime, the maximum penalty will be 90 per cent&mdash;quite a deterrent. If the level of penalty is reached, the penalty may include the loss of licence to operate as an OBU. So the loss of an OBU involves the whole of the branch, not just a particular segment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OBU must deal at market rates with its foreign associate companies, foreign branches and, if permitted, the domestic banking unit. If deals between the overseas banking unit and the domestic banking unit are done at off-market rates to shift profits, the penalty that I referred to can be applied where an OBU deals with a foreign branch or a foreign associate at off-market rates. So it is no easier for the overseas banking unit to deal at off-market rates with a domestic bank than it would be for an offshore branch or a subsidiary. Therefore, the Tax Office will be able to audit more easily the deals between the overseas banking units and the domestic banking units than deals in which a counter party is located offshore, because the Tax Office merely has to walk into the local office and examine all the records per se. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also been brought to my attention that, although the Government has had extensive consultations with the banking industry, one other part of the general business community has been ignored. In particular, I refer to the submissions that the Government and the Opposition have received from the Life Insurance Federation of Australia. Unfortunately, no answer or acknowledgment has been given by this Government to its submissions. I think that is discourteous, to say the least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The life insurance industry believes that this Bill should have allowed life companies and other relevant funds and management institutions to have some access to the proposed new overseas banking units arrangements on the same basis as banks and foreign exchange dealers. This approach would ensure neutral treatment of different financial institutions and consistency with the Government's objective of promoting Australia as an expanded financial centre for the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rationale for the LIFA approach is based on the following reasons. Firstly, life companies and fund managers generally provide a full range of financial services to non-residents with a particular emphasis on funds management, which is their core business activity. Secondly, the discriminatory application of the proposed tax concession between different institutions will immediately place life offices and other relevant institutions at a competitive disadvantage in the provision of international financial services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, in the medium term there could be an adverse impact on the competitiveness of life companies in the domestic funds management market. Fourthly, the proposed legislation will encourage the excluded institution to continue to provide international financial services for offshore centres to the detriment of the Australian revenue. Fifthly, a more even-handed approach in this area would enable life companies to compete effectively with both domestic and foreign banks while achieving the Government's objectives of establishing a viable regional financial services sector in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it has been submitted that the discriminatory application of the proposed tax concessions between life companies and other relevant institutions is a competitive disadvantage in the provision of financial services to non-residents. This will clearly lead to distortions in the financial sector in Australia. I look forward to hearing, in the name of giving all who submit submissions a fair hearing, the Parliamentary Secretary's response to the issues that I have raised in terms of the request made by the life insurance industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second major issue which is covered by this Bill is the new capital gains tax provisions contained in amendments to those two sections of the Income Tax Act known as the terrible twins, sections 160M(6) and (7). These two sections have been described as unworkable, difficult if not impossible to understand, and unduly complicated, by many tax experts including various High Court judges. It was as a result of the Hepples case decision that the Government was forced to redesign the provisions of sections 160M(6) and M(7). I have raised the difficulties associated with these two sections several times in this chamber and I urge any interested readers or listeners to this debate to pursue this issue because I do not believe the Government has yet got it right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes before us today can be described as perhaps the most important capital gains tax changes since part IIIA, the capital gains provisions, was introduced. The changes are meant to clarify these two sections, 160M(6) and (7), after the High Court could not agree in the noted Hepples case decision that applied particularly in the area of restrictive covenant payments. The amendments will provide that where a person creates a right in another person, the capital gains provisions can now apply to tax any consideration the person receives for creating that right. For example, the amendments make it clear that a payment received by a person for entering into a restrictive covenant, exclusive trade tie or similar agreement, will now be taxable under the capital gains provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the explanatory memorandum says that a draft of the amendments has been discussed with the tax representatives of the various legal and accounting professions with a view to ensuring that the desired clarity is achieved. I am not sure with whom the discussions were held, but two noted experts in taxation&mdash;I am referring to the Tax Institute of Australia and Mr Geoffrey Lehmann, who writes in a weekly column in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Australian</EMPHASIS>&mdash;have raised several problems with the new amendments. I refer the Government to page 21 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of Friday, 27 November for a fuller discussion of the problems as perceived by Geoffrey Lehmann. He states:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">The Phantom of the Australian Taxation Office</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June, the Government introduced capital gains tax amendments which are still before Parliament. There has been a surprising silence about their true implications. The explanatory memorandum circulated by the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, said the amendments "are not expected to have any significant impact on revenue".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, if they are conscientiously applied by the Australian Taxation Office they could apply to a myriad of transactions in a harsh and unpredictable manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this extraordinary situation is that the amendments create phantom capital gains. They have a legitimate objective. In past years, a favourite tax ploy was for employees to receive a large lump sum from their employer for an agreement or restrictive covenant not to compete. Such payments are not taxable as ordinary income as they are capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CGT legislation was announced on September 19, 1985, and introduced in May 1986. It applied to disposals of assets acquired after September 19, 1985.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those responsible for the original legislation appear to have been greedy. They wanted to catch payments on restrictive covenants from the date of the announcement, although this had not been adequately foreshadowed. So they devised two provisions, sub-sections 160M(6) and (7), which became known as the terrible twins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These purported to tax fictional disposals of assets transferred on their creation. The legislative words were fuzzy and mysterious, but they conformed with the verbal formula of the Treasurer's 1985 announcement which referred to disposals of assets. Meanwhile, the explanatory memorandum for the legislation explained what it all meant and listed several transactions, such as restrictive covenants, which were taxed by the terrible twins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there was a plan to introduce retrospective taxation by stealth, it blew up. In fact, it blew up twice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were protests about the retrospective aspect and the obscurity of the legislation. So, after initial intransigence, the law was changed to tax gains on asset creations only from when the legislation was introduced. Then, in the past 12 months, the High Court could not agree which of the terrible twins taxed restrictive covenants. So an employee, Mr Hepples, escaped tax-free. In the meantime, other smart employees jumped into the gap and got tax-free amounts under restrictive covenants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amended 160M(6) and (7), introduced in June, amply cover the gap. Unfortunately, the amendments apply to many innocent transactions also. The ATO tried to perfect the fuzzy language of former 160M(6), instead of simply listing the transactions which it wanted to tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall try to make the explanation which follows as untechnical as possible. New sub-section 160M(6) is to apply where there is a creation of an asset by one person that vests the asset in another person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A capital gain will be attributed to the first person equal to the value of the "consideration" he or she receives. If there is no consideration and the parties are at arm's length, another provision, which might otherwise operate, will not attribute to the first person a capital gain equal to the value of the created asset. "Consideration" is a term of contract law. When I pay a dollar for an ice cream, the dollar and the ice cream are the mutual consideration flowing between the vendor and me. Consideration can be money, property or a promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, under CGT law, consideration has a slightly narrower meaning and includes only money or property. Promises that are not property are not consideration for CGT purposes. The explanatory memorandum for 160M(6) correctly claims that it does not apply to an employment contract where John Jones contracts with Brown Manufacturing to be manager of Brown's sales division for two years solely on a commission basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum states: "John receives no inducement or other payment for entering into the contract . . . John has created an asset (viz, the rights of Brown under the contract to require John to perform his duties as sales manager . . . ) which, on its creation vests in Brown. John is taken to acquire, own and then dispose of the asset to Brown. However, as John receives no consideration in respect of the disposal . . . he will not have a capital gain . . . as a result of creating the asset.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum does not give a full explanation. John does receive consideration for contract law purposes&mdash;Brown's promise that John will be sales manager for two years. But this is not property, as it is non-assignable, so it is not "consideration" for CGT purposes and there is no capital gain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New 160M(6) is a minefield.

Unfortunately, they also apply to many innocent transactions.

<PARA>The explanations in the explanatory memorandum and the Bill surrounding this concept of consideration I believe are fuzzy, with the consequence that, on examination of the examples given, more questions are really raised than answered. Geoffrey Lehmann notes:</PARA>

<PARA>The Tax Institute also takes up the theme as to whether or not double taxation is prevented in relation to the disposal of an asset where the disposal gives rise to rights which in themselves are assets for the purposes of part IIIA. The most common example is in the case where a taxpayer has received compensation in relation to the loss or destruction of assets otherwise subject to capital gains liability. The concern is that the legislation is asset specific, not transactions specific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the amended definition of an asset, the Tax Institute further notes that the extension of the amendments to encompass non-proprietary rights is unwarranted and adds a considerable degree of uncertainty to the law. So I urge the Government to examine carefully the comments from both these sources of taxation expertise because I believe it is inappropriate to leave the taxpayer in a state of uncertainty, especially in a climate of self-assessment where the taxpayer is required to determine his own tax liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I leave this Bill, I would like to raise one final point. The Bill has significant retrospective operation. It states:</PARA>

On the one hand, we have a series of technical changes to the new sales tax law and the reimposition of the tax on the concrete shell of swimming pools, which was ruled invalid earlier this year by the High Court. On the other hand, we have the various income tax changes contained in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major sales tax initiative in this package is the reintroduction of a 20 per cent sales tax on the concrete shell of pools and spas</PARA>
<PARA>constructed in situ. This is a fair tax proposal, because prefabricated pools and spas are already taxed at 20 per cent. There is a distinct competitive advantage currently applying to in-ground pools which are constructed on site. Since these are often more expensive than the prefabricated ones, this exemption is probably regressive in its distributional impact. Consequently, we assume that removing the exemption will be progressive in its impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This question was dealt with by Parliament in 1986. The measure was passed to impose a tax from that time, but the High Court ruled in the Mutual Pools case in February this year that the original tax had been improperly passed. Consequently, the tax, which had been improperly collected, had to be refunded. This was an extraordinary situation. Special legislation was required to ensure that the person who bore the tax&mdash;either the pool builder, the pool purchaser or both jointly&mdash;actually received the refund. I do not want to revisit that debate; I simply want to put this legislation in context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court ruled that the tax was unconstitutional on a technicality. The result of that decision is particularly unjust, as taxpayers will have to refund about $40m, which could have been used for other purposes. However, there is little dispute that the decision is correct. Phil Cleary knows what it is like to be caught on a constitutional technicality. It simply shows that, although the Australian Constitution has generally served this country well, there are many areas in need of reform and modernisation. The States grants legislation will give me an opportunity to elaborate on that issue. </PARA>

A massive reduction in interest rates has meant that the statutory rate of penalty for the late payment of tax and other related penalties, which stands at 20 per cent, is deemed to be too high. This rate is reduced to 16 per cent from 1 October. The 16 per cent rate is high enough to discourage the non-payment of tax but also recognises that the 20 per cent rate is punitive, given current interest rate levels. We also have some technical amendments to the Bill to ensure that when recipients of a disability support pension or other similar benefits reach the age pension age, they will be taxable but will be eligible to receive a pensioner rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The so-called terrible twins of the capital gains tax, sections 160M(6) and (7), are completely rewritten to overcome what is to many an incredible decision of the High Court&mdash;another one&mdash;in the Hepples case. The capital gains tax is structured so as to tax assets when they are disposed of. Such a disposal test necessarily contemplates a prior acquisition of the asset. The difference in value between the acquisition and disposal, suitably discounted for inflation during the holding period, is then subject to tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terrible twins were introduced to cover respectively the situations where, firstly, an asset is created by the act of its disposal, and hence cannot be caught by the general provisions&mdash;examples are where a person creates an asset by granting a lease or an option&mdash;and, secondly, where certain capital payments are received which would not otherwise be taxed. This applies where an act or transaction takes place in relation to an asset or an event affecting an asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum to the original Bill clearly stated the intention that restrictive covenants would be caught, although the Hepples decision means that the provisions have to be amended. The incredible thing about the Hepples case&mdash;I think it is unique in Australian tax law history&mdash;was that a majority of the High Court judges thought that the amounts in question were properly taxable but they could not agree unanimously on why the amounts were taxable and under which provisions. It sounds like a case of deja vu. Hence, no tax was paid. I will not force the Senate to endure a technical explanation of the new provisions; I merely hope that the new legislation is successful in reaching its target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major matter in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) is an initiative from the One Nation statement. This is to provide a concessional income tax regime for offshore banking in Australia. This measure, unlike another one in the news at the moment&mdash;the matter of tax deductibility of personal superannuation&mdash;has not come out of the blue. Mr Keating looked at it in 1986 when the interest withholding tax was abolished for offshore banking transactions. He rejected it at that time. It has been on the agenda of the banks ever since. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The actual measures before us are very different from those announced in February. Senator Watson has already explained these in some detail, so I will spare the Senate any repetition. But I do think it is important to get on the record that the original proposals were to be revenue positive to the tune of $5m per year, yet through consultation the range of transactions covered by the concession has been expanded and this Bill is now estimated to cost $30m per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals relate to offshore banking units or OBUs. I will give honourable senators a piece of historical trivia. In times gone by, it would have been inconceivable that the conservative parties would be supporting legislation introduced by a Labor government to provide a tax preferred status to an OBU. As many honourable senators might be aware, especially those from New South Wales Labor, OBU was a huge issue in the early decades of this century. It referred to the proposal to create one big union which would unite all the workers of the nation and eventually the world. They would then overthrow the evil capitalists and everybody would live happily ever after. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That OBU was not successful and, unfortunately, the financial OBUs with which this legislation deals have not been successful either. The reason that the Australian OBUs have not been successful is that they are not competing on a level international playing field. Our main regional competitors in this field are Hong Kong and Singapore. Singapore has had a concessional income tax regime for many industries, including financial services, for many years, and they are a shining example of government guidance of successful economic development policies. Hong Kong has always been a low tax jurisdiction. So to compete in the industry we have to have a competitive tax system. Clearly, this Bill will achieve this. The States have also played their part, with the New South Wales Government abolishing some stamp duties and the Victorian Government announcing its intention to do the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In approaching this legislation, the Democrats have had to balance what we see as the disastrous consequences of financial deregulation generally&mdash;and speculation&mdash;and our opposition to those decisions, with the need to legitimise government intervention in the pursuit of industry policy objectives. Clearly, this proposal is an exercise in strategic trade theory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill deliberately introduces a distortion which is designed to attract financial transactions to Australia which would not otherwise occur here. The reason is to generate employment in the provision of financial services&mdash;something Australians are very good at&mdash;and to build Australia, most probably Sydney, into an international financial centre. The rapidly approaching reversion of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China creates a great opportunity to poach business and investment, irrespective of the stated intentions of the Chinese Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the Liberal Party always condemns government intervention. It is opposed to such distortions on principle because it says, I think it could be argued, that there is no role for government in industry policy. </PARA>

I will seek to emulate their brevity so that we do not have to sit too late, but there are a number of matters I need to deal with in summing up the second reading of this Bill. Firstly, I should thank all speakers and the Senate for supporting this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some important but agreed parts of this legislation that have not been significantly referred to; for example, the amendments to the treatment of disability support pensions, the special needs support pensions, bereavement payments and the textile, clothing and footwear special allowance, which I think are changes which are welcomed and should be noted once again for the record, as with the proposals to reduce the rate of penalties for late payments and related penalties from 20 per cent to 16 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4), it is clear that the principal changes relate to the CGT amendments and offshore banking units, and I will come back to each of those. In the course of so doing, I make it clear now that the Government will be moving an amendment, which has been circulated, to the offshore banking units section of the legislation when we get to the committee stage, but first I will deal with the provisions of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sales Tax Imposition (In Situ Pools) Bill 1992, which is being discussed in conjunction with the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4), is fundamentally about reimposing the 20 per cent tax on pools constructed in situ. Senator Kernot outlined the history and the rationale. Fundamentally, she did so accurately, and I have nothing to add. It also makes some other changes. I note with amusement her adoption of my bowerbird analogy, and I hope that I never need to use it again. I welcome the support for the Bills, and at this stage there is no need to go further with them. I hope that they get a speedy passage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, however, some important issues with regard to the capital gains tax section and the offshore banking unit section. I will refer to the capital gains tax section first. It falls into two parts, and I will come back to Mr Lehmann's concerns in a moment. In general, there is some concern that in the course of clarifying the meaning of subsections 160M(6) and 160M(7) we have not made some of the policy changes people would like to have seen made. We had no intention of so doing. It was in no way the intention of these changes; they are intended not to change policy but to clarify the operation of the section as it was always intended to operate prior to the decision of the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The object of the original subsections 160M(6) and (7) was to assess capital payments not received as a result of the disposal of an asset. That is really what drives our difference with Mr Lehmann's article.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and even worse, people have to listen. One can hear radios clicking off all around the country at the mention of one of the three of us getting up to speak; people go out for a cup of tea, I think. There is a little journalistic licence in the article, but I understand the thrust of what Mr Lehmann was trying to put.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make three points in response. Firstly, it was not intended that the sorts of capital payments that the section was to deal with should be restricted to those mentioned in the original explanatory memorandum. They were examples. The present amendments are designed to clarify the means by which such payments will be assessed. It is a restatement of the general principle in a way that is intended to be, and I think is, clearer. But it is not appropriate&mdash;and certainly the Government was not, and is not, attracted to the proposition&mdash;that we should move to adopt a list system; that is, we list the payments that are to be covered. The concern would be that that might constitute an invitation to design transactions that are not covered by the list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with purporting to list all that which is covered is that it therefore means that, if something can be developed that does not fit that description, by definition, it is not covered, although the principle may be the same. If we look at the broad question of the way in which the modernisation of the tax Act will develop, as a general approach it is better to go to the principles, rather than to try to cover all the possible examples in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the offshore banking units, there has been a lot of discussion in the public and in the Parliament in response to One Nation and, in the nine months subsequently, about the provision. I will not reiterate all that. I strongly support the proposal. I have strongly supported the proposal for six years. Senator Kernot may have touched upon a subliminal reason, some sort of hankering for the international workers of the world to remerge, but I doubt it very much. It is a proposal that I supported when Neville Wran, Nick Whitlam and others were trying to get the proposal up in the early 1980s, without success, and I am pleased that it has succeeded now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With all such proposals, which I strongly support, there is a question of balance. It does not just mean that, because we wish to see an internationally competitive tax regime in Australia for offshore banking, every change that might be beneficial to offshore banking ought to be done; a balance needs to be struck. The industry has strongly argued that viability of an Australian offshore banking regime depends on Australia's ability to compete on an even footing with other countries in our region that already provide a broad range of concessions. That is broadly true. The Government shares that view, but it is also concerned to balance that by ensuring that Australia's domestic revenue base is protected; that is, we do not go to changes which endanger the revenue beyond that which is necessary to encourage offshore banking. It is a difficult balance to strike. We are moving into a new area and we need to proceed very cautiously and in a very considered way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That essentially underpins the Government's concern about the Opposition's amendment. If I speak on it now, it will save time in the committee stage, when I can be brief. The Government does not accept the proposed amendment. It thinks that there is an unacceptable level of risk that income can be shifted from the 39 per cent tax category to the 10 per cent tax category and, similarly, that losses could be created and applied against the 39 per cent tax category. If this form of internal dealing were allowed, it would be impossible for the Tax Office auditors to check whether transactions were properly booked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reserve Bank has given advice that this sort of internal dealing is not necessary in order to enable a bank to effectively manage its currency risk. It has also advised that it would be impracticable to try to monitor whether such transactions were done at market value because normal trade volumes, which are very significant, would make such transactions very difficult to identify. Experienced Tax Office auditors have confirmed that advice. To save some time in the committee stage&mdash;although I am sure that I will be able to say some of that again&mdash;I just put that on the record now. Senator Watson will still, of course, proceed with his amendment, but that is why the Government is not supporting it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say something very briefly about the second reading amendment, without taking much time. It seemed to me at first reaction to be a very strange time to be moving it. Apart from the fact that it is a strange time to be moving it at 11 o'clock at night, I rather meant that it is a strange time in the evolution of Australian tax policy. We have before us an example of the approach to which Senator Kernot is referring. In her speech in support of the amendment, she did say, `If you have made this small step, why not take a giant leap?'. That is why the second reading amendment flows from the offshore banking provisions of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that there is no necessary correlation between being more interventionist and achieving economic improvement. I have said many times in this Senate&mdash;and I repeat now&mdash;that I am a long way from being one of the Senate's purists about the interrelationship between tax and industry policy. As with matters of environmental and social policy, when the cost benefit is right I am prepared to look at using the tax system for those other purposes. I have made it clear, and One Nation makes it clear, that the Government is prepared to look at those sorts of initiatives. It has done so with regard to a number of matters flowing from One Nation, most of which have passed this Senate, and once we conclude tonight the offshore banking will have done the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem in Australia is that too often we look at the tax system as the first and easiest way to achieve those objectives because, firstly, there is a fascination with tax exemption and, secondly, it is often seen as costless. We make this incentive and there is no government outlay, but there is a cost to revenue. The difficulty is that it is often a cost to revenue that cannot be accurately predicted, as with the assistance to the film industry. So there are cases for being interventionist&mdash;whether one would say more or less is a value judgment&mdash;and there are cases when the Government should use the tax system or other measures to achieve its economic, environmental and social objectives. I do not think it is a question of saying that it should have general or blanket application. We should make a cost benefit and decide.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each time we do it we add complexity; each time we do it we add compliance costs; and each time we do it we run the risk of unforeseen consequences and revenue costs which we cannot necessarily predict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not accept the second reading amendment. I think the Government should continue to strike a balance on a rational cost benefit basis about when and if we should use tax policy. I will not refer to whether we should be using industry policy. It is hardly what we should do under a second reading amendment about the tax laws. Whether we should use taxation policy more or less will depend on the circumstances as they arise from time to time. We should continue to give practical application to the cost benefit principles that ought to be applied to deciding whether we will amend the tax policy on any particular occasion. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to manage foreign currency trading positions, it is vital that the overseas banking unit (OBU) be allowed to deal with the domestic bank (DBU) at market rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, the domestic banking unit should be allowed to trade US Dollars/Japanese Yen with the overseas banking unit. The Bank's treasury division (DBU) for this purpose must be considered separate from the OBU and allowed to trade with the OBU.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ATO position is that a potential for tax avoidance could arise. However, the case for separation is quite substantial:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1.The explanatory memorandum clearly states that an OBU be treated as if it is a separate bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">2.The legislation allows internal deals between the OBU and a foreign branch of the same bank (see Section 121C). It is merely an extension of this principle to allow for internal deals between the OBU and the Australian Branch of the same bank (ie the DBU).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">3.Without the amendment as suggested the OBU would not be in a position to offset a currency exposure on a transaction with a non-resident with a hedge taken locally to offset the risk. It is therefore an incentive to transact that business in Australia, and further the ATO could be at an auditing disadvantage, especially in Singapore, and where the secrecy provision in the banking legislation precludes the passing of the information in respect of transactions in and out of Singapore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">4.The bank must ultimately hedge its position back into Australian dollars. A bank could suffer currency risks which it is unable to efficiently manage because of the differing tax rules for the OBU/DBU. Therefore, the final Australian dollar hedge will have to be undertaken within the main bank where the OBU has the underlying currency exposure and the main bank has the matching hedge, it can be seen that each has an exposed position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The logical solution to this is to permit the OBU to enter into a hedge with the main bank, the result of the hedge being to close out the exposed position of each of the OBU and the main bank and return them both to a fully hedged position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Anti-avoidance</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The explanatory memorandum states that the level of penalties associated with the new self assessment provisions will apply where profit shifting has occurred between classes of income with different taxing rights. Under this regime the maximum penalty will be 90%. Where this level of penalty is reached, the penalty may include the loss of license to operate an OBU.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The abovementioned proposed amendments will not allow for profit shifting or avoidance schemes. The OBU must deal at market rates with its foreign associated companies and foreign branches and, if permitted the DBU. If deals between the OBU and DBU are done at off market rates to shift profits then the abovementioned penalty provisions can be applied where an OBU deals with a foreign branch or foreign associate at off market rates. It is no easier for the OBU to deal at off market rates with the DBU than it would be with an offshore branch or subsidiary. Furthermore, the ATO will be able to more easily audit deals between the OBU and the DBU than deals where a counterparty is located offshore</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am disappointed that the Government does not intend to support these amendments, because without them the domestic banks will be unable to reach their full potential in terms of the advantages that should have been available through the creation of overseas banking units. The domestic banking units will now be quite reluctant to deal in currencies where there is any significant risk whatsoever. Ultimately, the bank must hedge its position back into Australian dollars. Without the amendment, the bank could suffer currency risks which it is unable to manage efficiently because of the differing tax rules for the overseas banking units vis-a-vis the domestic banking units. Therefore, the final Australian dollar hedge will have to be undertaken within the bank's main treasury where the overseas banking unit has the underlying currency exposure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The logical proposition, and this is implied in the explanatory memorandum, is that the DBU can deal with the OBU. From the point of view of anti-avoidance, the explanatory memorandum states that the level of penalties associated with the new provisions are quite severe. The maximum penalty is 90 per cent or even the loss of licence. The proposed amendments in the Bill will not allow for profit shifting or avoidance and the OBU must deal at market rates with its foreign associated companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We pointed out that it is much easier to check those transactions even though they will be technical and voluminous. But there will be very little to check if the Singapore banking legislation forbids the exchange of such information. We believe that such transactions would be more expeditiously carried out here in Australia where the Taxation Office can check the transactions. True, there might be a lot of them, but I venture to say that the transaction would be recorded when the transaction initially takes place and any subsequent creative accounting would be picked up. The penalties for such creative accounting would be very severe. I regret that the Government has taken this, what I call over-cautious approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am on my feet I will also refer to the problems of 160M(6) and (7). I did not indicate in my contribution to the second reading debate that I hope that before this Bill receives royal assent the Government will refer these revised provisions to an expert, such as Professor Arnold, in view of the comments from the Tax Institute and Geoffrey Lehmann's article. We have had criticism enough of this Parliament enacting legislation that does not stand up in court. As this is our second attempt at this legislation, and given the fact that there has been severe criticism of it, I believe it is not unreasonable for us to ask for an independent review before this matter receives royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, we could have requested that a committee look at it, but we throw it back into the Government's own court. These significant issues have been raised. We believe it is incumbent on the Government&mdash;it has been given due warning&mdash;to get it right. In view of the provisions of 160M(7) particularly, I call on the Government to issue rulings and determinations immediately to clarify this catch-all provision. I point out that subsections 160M(6) and (7) are the catch-all provisions relating to assessability in the capital gains area. Therefore, it is necessary for these rulings and determinations to be issued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must compliment the Taxation Office on issuing a plethora of such rulings in recent times. Not everybody agrees with them, but at least it puts some certainty into the law which I think is necessary in a self-assessment environment. When we sought changes to the capital gains provisions before the Government sought to redraft the legislation, we were not seeking policy changes at all; we merely wished to clarify the outstanding issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are still some problems with the legislation and some of these are unintended. For example, under the legislation, it is possible that a wedding gift could be given by an admirer to the bride but, rather than cash, it could be something which would add to the value of their house&mdash;say, a verandah. Technically, under these sorts of provisions, that situation could arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are still difficulties with what is known as part disposals and the lack of capital base. The principal problem that arises in this area relates to easements. That issue needs to be examined, particularly from the point of view of a tax ruling or a determination. Without a legislative base, we still have an unsatisfactory situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer briefly to the reasons why we did not support the Democrats' second reading amendment about a more interventionist approach to taxation policy. Again, we disagree with both the Government and the Democrats. We believe that so many of the problems within the Income Tax Assessment Act&mdash;its volume, complexity and its difficulties&mdash;have arisen through using the taxation legislation as a vehicle for so many desirable causes of the time. This applies not only to social policy but also to industry policy. Quite often, specific legislation is a much better vehicle for handling such problems. On behalf of the Opposition, I say that we regret that neither the Government nor the Democrats will be supporting our amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I took the opportunity of putting the Government's position on the amendment in the second reading debate, so I will not repeat that. I will use this opportunity to respond to some of the points Senator Watson made about capital gains tax. I suspect it was his way of getting around the 20-minute limit on speeches in the second reading debate. He made some second reading type comments in relation to the CGT in the committee stage. That is perfectly valid; we are dealing with the Bill as a whole and those clauses are before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hardest thing in introducing and explaining new clauses, particularly in complex areas&mdash;in this instance tax law, but also in other areas of the law&mdash;is to persuade people what will not happen. One can never prove what will not happen and people of imagination are always capable of finding horrors that might flow if certain interpretations were to be taken. In response to that, on the basis of the advice the Government has received, it thinks most of the worst fears that people have about what might happen under 160M(6) and 160M(7) will not eventuate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the more specific level, on consultation, rulings and determinations, I am advised that a meeting of the capital gains tax subcommittee of the taxation liaison group will be held on Wednesday.

I expect that, flowing from that conversation and consultation, rulings and determinations will start to flow relatively quickly thereafter, without putting a specific date on it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To respond to Senator Kernot, I did indicate that the lack of acceptance of this amendment would mean that the domestic banking units would not be able to reach their full potential because of the potential exposure to risk. Ultimately, the domestic banking units must hedge basically back to Australian dollars. It is much easier for that to occur domestically rather than elsewhere around the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that artificially changing the transactions to create a profit shifting on artificial tax loss is not on. The Australian banks have a good record of not being in the practice of tax avoidance. The penalties in this area of profit shifting from the 10 per cent for losses artificially to the 39 per cent regime are very high&mdash;90 per cent&mdash;and can ultimately lead to the loss of the licence itself, which no bank would be prepared to forgo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the intention of creating an overseas banking unit philosophy and enshrining it in legislation is to create a level playing field to enable Australian institutions to share in these sorts of transactions, the bringing to Australia from Hong Kong and Singapore of this sort of business will be thwarted as a result of this legislation not being accepted. It is true that they will be able to engage in items without risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these things do involve an element of risk. Senator Kernot indicated how much this would actually cost. I would foresee that the additional business and the revenue derived from it would ultimately offset that loss. Banks, of course, do not enter transactions in the knowledge initially of losing money. Any subsequent bookkeeping entries that might transfer at that loss-profit shifting exercise is simply not on, because of the punitive provisions that are there for so-called profit shifting. The banks would be very remiss if they started to engage in this sort of activity and would be wide open in an audit. If any of these sorts of issues are to be raised, I believe it is a lot easier for the transactions to be carried out in Australia rather than overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there are two matters to which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) has failed to respond.

We intend to give the legislation royal assent as it stands, but we certainly intend to talk and consult with people about it and about the rulings and determinations which need to flow to assist people in, firstly, calming some of their fears, which I think it will do, and, secondly, advising them of how it might work.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To protect the revenue, the proposed OBU concessional tax regime contains certain interest deeming provisions which relate to the use of borrowed funds to buy shares in a subsidiary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Their purpose is to prevent tax benefits arising where an Australian parent company gets tax deductions with a tax effect of 39% when it borrows funds and then uses the funds to capitalise a subsidiary, thereby enabling it to derive income taxable at 10% by carrying on offshore banking activities.</PARA>
