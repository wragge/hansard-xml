<PARA>This inquiry arose out of the consideration by the Committee of the Education Services (Export Regulations) Bill 1990. In reporting to the Senate on the Bill, in May 1991, the Committee recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the operation of the Bill, if passed as an Act, be referred back to the Committee for inquiry and report, on, or before the first sitting day in December 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>In August this year, the Committee wrote to the Department of Employment, Education and Training and organisations representing both the industry and students seeking submissions on the operation of the ESOS Act. A public hearing involving interested parties was held on 9 October. The exercise of reviewing the implementation and operation of the Act has been a worthwhile one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review made it clear that, while there have been some problems in implementing the legislation, it has provided a coherent regulatory framework at the national level for safeguarding the financial stability of institutions involved in the provision of educational services to overseas students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major recommendation arising from this review is that the date of the sunset clause on which the legislation would cease to have effect should be amended from 1 January 1994 to 1 January 1995. The Committee recommended this change in the date of effect of the sunset clause for two reasons. The first was the need expressed by industry representatives for a stable policy environment. The second reason for extending the operation of the Act was the slow pace at which the States have moved to bring in legislation to provide financial security for fees paid by overseas students. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The main purpose of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) is to give effect to the announcement of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) on 13 November of plans to reallocate $150m from rail expenditures and $24m from electricity expenditures, contained in the Budget, to other infrastructure and labour market projects. The introduction of these additional Appropriation Bills at this time is extraordinary. The Bills reappropriate funds from Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No. 2), which had not even been passed by the Senate before the Treasurer's 13 November statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Budget Appropriation Bills are only two months old and already the Government has been forced to admit that $174m of proposed spending in 1992-93 cannot be achieved. The timing of these Bills reflects the economic shambles of the Government's economic and budgetary mismanagement. It is totally politically driven. It shows yet again that we cannot trust Labor with our money or our jobs. It is more evidence of the Government trying to push some people out of the official unemployment statistics through hasty, make-work spending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Bills demonstrate the failure of the Government's economic policies. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has no answers to the massive unemployment he has caused. This is one more shameful attempt to buy our way out of our problems. It is clear that the Government has turned its back on the structural reforms required to really get employment growing again. It has all become too hard. These Bills are looking for an easy solution, but they will only disguise the problems in the short term and worsen the economic prospects of the economy in the medium term. The failures of this Government's policies are reflected in the failures of One Nation and in the failures of the Budget, which the Government has recognised, as seen through its back-pedalling on some of its One Nation and Budget commitments in these Bills. But it is still on the wrong track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What were the promises of One Nation? They were: more jobs, tax cuts, increased infrastructure spending and, in the words of Mr Keating, `A statement to get Australia moving; a four-year strategy for growth in the nineties'. Those were the promises. What has materialised? Since February, for every new job created in Australia two have been lost. Tax cuts were premised on totally unrealistic growth forecasts and with recourse to secret tax increases. They cannot be delivered. These Bills show how much of the promised increased infrastructure spending is now being diverted into other things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for being a four-year strategy for growth, in February the One Nation growth forecast was 4 3/4 per cent. In June it was reduced to 4 per cent. By the Budget in August it was down to 3 per cent. Now it is anyone's guess how much lower still it will go after the release of today's national accounts figures. Three wrong estimates in nine months. So much for the promises of One Nation, in which the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1992 we need recovery and we need jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>Keating's One Nation statement has failed to deliver on any of its promises. What the Prime Minister did not say was that an export-led recovery is what we need. Just how far we have to go on that front was shown in the October balance of payments figures, released yesterday, which revealed a massive $1.8 billion deficit&mdash;the highest in nearly three years&mdash;and an incredible 11 per cent fall in exports in just one month. As for unemployment, the Prime Minister said in February this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the economy grows, employment grows . . . If we can't do better than 4 per cent GDP growth, we should pack it in&mdash;me, the bureaucracy, the Parliament, the lot of us . . .</PARA>
<PARA>But full time employment is now lower than it was in February when that statement was made, which shows again that we just cannot trust Labor with our jobs or our money. We need change in Australia; we need it desperately. We need commonsense change and we need it now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every piece of economic news since the release of One Nation has shown just what a sham that One Nation document was. The lies behind the outrageously optimistic forecasts and the platitudinous statements by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to gild the budgetary lily are now all being exposed. How could anyone have claimed in One Nation that the Budget would be returned to surplus in four years? It has not taken long for that Labor lie to come unstuck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February, the starting point for this year's Budget deficit was projected by the Government as $8 billion. In May, that was revised to $10.5 billion. The August Budget said $13.4 billion. The Government's own financial estimates from the Bureau of Statistics last week now suggest $14.5 billion and even this $14.5 billion already looks highly optimistic. The Prime Minister has backed right off his promise of a return to surplus. The One Nation statement says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With our strategy, within four years the Federal Budget will return to surplus.</PARA>
<PARA>But in a pathetic interview with Kerry O'Brien on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> less than a fortnight ago he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But since when did we have to get back to surpluses? Since when are they holy writ?</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister himself seemed to think that surpluses were pretty important, and rightly so. In the 1986-87 Budget, when he was Treasurer, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We must save for the future rather than spend for the present. The Government can help this process directly by spending less and borrowing less, thereby improving the climate for lower interest rates and for private sector investment.</PARA>
<PARA>There have been numerous statements since then about the importance of Budget surpluses. In the 1990-91 Budget Speech he said that the Budget will `build on the fiscal achievements secured to date and maintains fiscal policy as the Government's principal weapon in the fight against the current account deficit and our overseas debt'. In the accompanying Budget statements, the then Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is vital is that those policies&mdash;including maintenance of high levels of public sector saving&mdash;continue over the 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA>Even Treasurer Dawkins's last Budget Speech contained the same theme when he said `the Government will eliminate the deficit as soon as possible'. The accompanying papers to this year's Budget state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Budget deficit will need to be progressively wound back. Fiscal policy can then resume its important medium term role of increasing national saving and reducing recourse to foreign financing of domestic investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where are all those fine and correct sentiments now? The political heat has been turned up and the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have welshed on all of that. They have given up on fiscal policy and instead they have chosen to play subsidy politics. Dr Ross Garnaut, a former economic adviser to the Hawke Government, has strongly criticised the so-called fiscal boost of which the spending in these Bills is a part. Asked last week if short term Budget stimulation would aid the recovery, Garnaut said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think if you pump up domestic demand&mdash;a bit more government expenditure&mdash;that's an illusion. That slows down the fundamental structural change that'll end up delivering more good jobs at high incomes.</PARA>
<PARA>Like so many others then, Garnaut is focusing on the importance of structural change, so-called micro-economic reform. But not only is the fiscal house out of control, the Prime Minister has given up on micro-economic reform as well. A fortnight ago, again in the same infamous Kerry O'Brien <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> interview, the Prime Minister said that the great micro reform agenda was mostly completed. That is another lie which was exposed with the release of the Industry Commission's annual report last week. That report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The imperative is to act quickly and to tackle reform on a broad front . . . However, in light of what governments must do to lift Australia's economic performance, reform initiatives have been lacking in number and scope.</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, the Industry Commission report makes it clear that not only is the Government's agenda not broad enough, but also it has let many promised reforms slip, including backtracking by the National Road Transport Commission, increasing assistance for footwear, delayed reforms in the sugar and dairying industries and many more examples stated in that report. In a total reverse of the Prime Minister's statement, the report states, `Clearly, much more remains to be done'. So much for the Prime Minister's statement that the great micro-economic reform agenda has been almost completed. What absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are not the only problems highlighted in the Industry Commission report. Elsewhere in this very carefully considered document there is direct criticism of other Government policy areas. For example, in some areas the gains do not seem to have been passed on to users. Through the national procurement and development program there is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a danger of damaging Australia's competitiveness by encouraging subsidy dependence and weakening the capacity of markets to determine R&amp;D priorities.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Hewson has said that the IC report shows the fictional nature of the Government's incessant boasts about micro-economic reform. They are incessant boasts, and they are absolutely fictional. The Industry Commission report makes a very strong case that, without accelerating the pace of micro-economic reform on a broad front, unemployment will remain at high levels for the rest of the decade, even if our underlying GDP growth is strengthened. It is no surprise that the labour market is seen as the area in most need of reform. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much more is to be gained from extending reform . . . particularly removing impediments to the efficient operation of labour markets.</PARA>
<PARA>But labour market reform has been in the too hard basket for this Government throughout its whole term of office. The Commission report again makes it clear that the training levy is the last way we should be looking to improve our productivity, and it emphasises clearly the need for more flexibility in the labour market. Here is just some of the flavour of the report's statements on this issue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increased flexibility in wages and conditions would allow current and prospective employees to judge where skill shortages are greatest and where there would be pay-offs to additional training.</PARA>
<PARA>Precisely; that is just what the coalition's labour market reforms would deliver. The report endorses very strongly what the coalition has been saying in this area of labour market reform. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More closely aligning remuneration to skill levels would see some unwinding of currently compressed wage relativities.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, that is precisely what a coalition government would deliver. They are not just propositions to get Australians back into jobs. They are not just our propositions; they are also the propositions of one of the Government's most respected advisory bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only Government reports making such claims. Douglas Myers, a leading New Zealand businessman and the Chief Executive of Lion Nathan&mdash;which owns the Swan, Tooheys and Castlemaine Perkins breweries&mdash;has criticised the economic and industrial reforms in Australia as moving far too slowly. Indeed he, with vast business experience on both sides of the Tasman, says that in Australia the reforms have been so slow that he considers Australia is now a decade behind New Zealand. How could anyone have believed that that could be the case just five or 10 years ago?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chief Executive of Heinz Australia has pointed out that labour on-costs in Australia&mdash;which include payroll tax, work premiums, rostered days off, sick leave, long service leave, annual leave, leave loadings and shift premiums&mdash;add 33 per cent to wage costs, whereas in New Zealand the figure is closer to 16 per cent. In total, the cost of employing people in New Zealand is only 64 per cent of what it is in Australia. That is why Heinz Australia is using New Zealand, not Australia, as a base for the whole of its South East Asian operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Faced with these facts, the Prime Minister and the Government have decided that they will turn their back on the only road to real solutions and, instead, put a few bandaids on the massively haemorrhaging economy with these Bills that we are debating today. This is in the hope that things will hold together until the election is over, in the hope that we will be able to hide some of the one million Australians who are now unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mickey mouse job creation schemes which are added to in these Bills just do not work. All the statistics since One Nation show that. Yet this Government is simply trying to deliver more of the same. When the money runs out&mdash;and that is our money; the taxpayers' money&mdash;so will the jobs. There will be no long term jobs, just a bigger debt bill to hang around our necks for decades to come. This is a blatant attempt to get people off the dole queues until after the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor fails to see that real job creation requires the lifting of the load from business. After all, it is business, not governments, that creates real jobs. This is one of the central planks of the coalition reform agenda. That is why we will remove a massive $20,000m tax burden from business and why our industrial relations reforms will allow us to have the flexibility and innovation to not only take on the best of the world, but also beat them. We can do it together, but the Government has to stop getting in the way and it has to be prepared to create the right environment for commonsense change, which is what our reforms are all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Criticism is even coming from within Labor's own ranks. The former Premier of Victoria, John Cain, stated the other day that the Keating Government is in an `economic policy vacuum' and in no shape to govern for three more years. Bob Carr, the Labor Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, said much the same thing yesterday. He laid the blame for the disgrace of youth homelessness and the million unemployed in Australia fairly and squarely on this Federal Labor Government. Let us have a look at the results of 10 years of hard Labor. Again, I quote the Government's own expert advisory body, the Industry Commission. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comparisons with other countries, and between firms producing comparable outputs&mdash;both here and overseas&mdash;provide a means of assessing whether an economy is realising its potential. From an international perspective Australia's productivity record suffers by comparison with the achievements of other countries, while at the industrial level there is generally even less to boast about.</PARA>
<PARA>The solutions again accord with coalition policies. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a consistent message to emerge is that large gains can be achieved through better use of labour and capital resources already employed. The key is better management and a more flexible workforce.</PARA>
<PARA>The attempt to generate jobs through the programs in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) will prove just as ineffective as those of One Nation and the Budget. If the Government had not wasted 10 years sitting on its hands, if it had been prepared to act on the structural problems which the coalition has spoken of and addressed in its policy reform package, we need not be in this current malaise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Bills are not about job creation; they are about vote creation. Let us bring on the election. What the Government is trying to do here is buy votes. Let us put it to the test with an election. The time is right for real change. We have the answers; the Government does not. It has absolutely run out of any answers for the future. It relies totally on the failed policies of the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have very real concerns about these Bills. Quick fixes of the type contained in these Bills are not the answer. I therefore foreshadow that at the conclusion of this second reading debate I will be moving that these Bills be referred to the appropriate Estimates committees for normal consideration and report to the Senate before they are further considered in the Committee of the Whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very appropriate that the Senate is debating these Bills on this particular day. It comes the day after we have had the worst balance of payments result in almost three years&mdash;the ninth successive increase in the balance of payments deficit. In an hour or so we will have the national accounts figures for the September quarter, which are almost certain to show that the economy continues to wallow in the trough of recession and despair. This Government is fairly and squarely, absolutely and totally responsible for the dreadful hardship that most Australians feel nowadays. It is fairly and squarely responsible for the one million Australians who are now unemployed and the further million who are either underemployed or who have dropped out of the work force in despair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today is a very significant day in Australia's economic history. It is about 6 1/2 years since the famous banana republic day of May 1986. Today I believe will go down in Australia's economic history, coupled with yesterday's balance of payments result, as a day when we will say to this Government that everything it said correctly about the difficulties facing us in 1986 are still there to be revisited. Not one thing has been done in those last 6 1/2 years to repair that fatal damage that this Government has caused to the community. The sooner we have an election and throw this Government out and introduce a government that has the solutions for the future, that can give hope, growth, prosperity and opportunity for the future, the better it will be. From our point of view, that cannot come a moment too soon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) reallocate the various appropriations to implement the allocation of spending announced recently by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). Appropriation Bill (No. 3) amends Appropriation Act (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) amends Appropriation Act (No. 2). Broadly, money earmarked for infrastructure, specifically $150m for rail projects and $24m for electricity transmission projects, is being reallocated to other functions. The projects have been deferred, as I understand it, not abandoned. This is particularly important in the case of rail projects because the level of Federal Government involvement in developing a national rail system has been improving in recent years. The upgrading promised in the One Nation statement was years overdue and hence very welcome. It would be a national tragedy if the projects were abandoned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reallocation has apparently occurred because some money could not be spent on the original proposals. In the case of the rail proposals, the relevant planning and design work was not complete and the economic viability of the upgrade of the transmission links between the south-eastern States is dubious at this stage. Given the low level of activity in the economy, the Government has decided to spend this money on alternative projects which can commence and hence generate employment quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats do not oppose this proposal. Indeed, we support programs to end the misery of unemployment for Australian families. The Opposition cannot have it both ways. It cannot condemn the Government for failing to create jobs and at the same time condemn the Government for recognising impediments to job creation and taking action to overcome these impediments. The replacement spending programs include various training initiatives, including a special package for large employers who are willing to offer to employ at least an additional 100 people who have been unemployed for at least six months, or who qualify as young trainees. A similar scheme is available for regional authorities who employ an additional 200 people. The subsidies offered are substantial. They represent roughly 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the wage cost for each new employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed that in his discussion of labour costs, Senator Short did not mention that company executives salaries' rose at more than five times the rate of ordinary employee wage rises over the last year. That is always conveniently overlooked. There are other subsidy arrangements for small business employers in this package in such areas as traineeships and apprenticeships. There is also a program to build sporting infrastructure and a further $30m for the Federal black spot road safety program. Further local government based infrastructure programs receive $55m. There is also a refurbishment for the Old Parliament House. </PARA>

I expect further Opposition speakers to berate the Government, but I think that what we ought to do is to say, `Look, it wasn't technically necessary to alter existing appropriations for the deferred expenditure'.

I think the Government allocated that figure in the hope that it would look good in the Budget and the One Nation statement. The Government has taken seven or eight months to come up with this excuse.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rail will continue to be neglected even though it could have created jobs. Jobs in the area of rail are not mickey mouse jobs. Heavy construction is involved. The jobs are in the factories building the concrete sleepers, out where the track is laid, out where the track is cleared, or where the signalling gear is installed. Meaningful jobs are created. What I thought was the most important part of the One Nation package has been neglected entirely.</PARA>

If we get more of that freight onto rail, there will be fewer road accidents, and road transport can be used closer to home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that the main reason for the hold-up of the project has been the failure of the Federal Government to get the concurrence of all the State governments for the link-up of the National Rail Corporation. I understand that Western Australia has finally accepted the package to join the NRC, but it has been a very slow process. The main reason it has been held up has been that the Federal Government wanted to buy out the Westrail section for almost zilch, and of course the Government of Western Australia would not accept that. Of course, it also had other problems with the unions. </PARA>

There is also $18.75m for sport and recreation programs for the construction of facilities by local government. We have heard a bit in the press lately about local government with the local government capital grants. It seems to me that local governments are simply using these extra allocations to boost their own budgets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation also appropriates $30m for the Federal black spots program, to fix the accident black spots on the main highways. I commend that program, which was initiated by the previous Prime Minister and which does seem to be working, although I cannot really see why the accident black spots are in areas of high unemployment. This reallocation of moneys is supposed to create 31,000 jobs&mdash;all new positions. Let us see what happens. We certainly need some boost to employment with an unemployment rate in Australia at the moment of 11.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us look at what has happened in the past. We are only three months down the track since Appropriation Bills Nos 1 and 2 were debated and passed. We had a promise then that 13,000 new jobs would be created under the local government capital grants program. The Minister for Local Government, David Simmons, in a press release said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New and expanded programs in several portfolios, including Employment, Education and Training, Primary Industries and Energy and Land Transport, will be available as part of the Keating Government's strategy to get employment moving at the local level.</PARA>
<PARA>In the same press release, under the heading `$350 Million for Local Capital Works Program', he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This major new program will allow councils in areas experiencing high and protracted levels of unemployment to undertake capital works projects that they may have the need for, but not the financial capacity to see through.</PARA>
<PARA>The press release further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Simmons said this broad national coverage was a very important feature of the program, with metropolitan and rural councils all standing to benefit from projects that will boost local economies and employment and provide worthwhile permanent assets.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on further to say that under category 1 there would be a minimum labour force of 60,000 persons. What has happened with that local government employment program? I have said time and again in this place that the only people who will benefit will be those already employed in local government, or contractors for local government. I said it in the debate on the Budget Speech and I said it in debate on the One Nation statement&mdash;but, of course, no one believed me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is finally coming home to roost, as newspaper headlines show. A headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> of 30 November 1992 reads, `$400,000 pavement scheme down the drain for jobless'. In other words, none of the jobless ever got jobs. Another headline in the same newspaper reads, `$345m empty promise'. Yet another headline reads, `$345m political bonus turns into big liability'. In other words, those local government capital works programs have not added to employment. I believe this will happen again. The work will go to people who are already employed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday Senator Tate defended the non-event of 13,000 supposed new jobs. He said that the money would be used to retain jobs. I have gone through One Nation, through the Budget Papers and through Mr Simmons's press release and nowhere does it say that the money was to retain jobs. It was supposed to create new jobs. The best I can find out to date is that it has created four new jobs. Contractors do not necessarily buy materials in those areas where a boost to employment is needed. They buy materials where they can get them the cheapest, and that is not necessarily where grants are made. I presume that we have to agree with the Government that if this money is not getting spent it has to be reallocated. I wish the Government better luck than it had last time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The leaked document of 12 November from the Taxation Office, as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, says that the Tax Office has a $3.4 billion shortfall in tax collection so far this year. GDP was supposed to be a minimum of 4 per cent. I think Mr Keating said he would resign if it fell below that. It is now less than 3 per cent. As time goes by we will be looking for more Bankcard-type financing to try to get Australia's unemployment rate down and keep this Government going. I support what my colleague Senator Short said. The matter should go to a committee and be examined further to see what exactly the Government can do. I wish the Government better luck with this package than it had with One Nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia has a profusion of pressing problems brought upon it by a decade of incompetent Labor governments, not only this Federal Labor Government but also many State Labor governments. The most urgent problem is the lack of employment opportunity, which is becoming chronic, for more than 11 per cent of the working population. Virtually one million people are now unable to find a job as a result of the continuing uncertainties in Australia's economy and our lack of economic recovery. Our economy is now in a feeble state as a direct result of 10 years of too much talk and too much Cabinet bravado and far too little action and appropriate initiation of policy reform. The One Nation statement is a further example of too much talk and too little action. It represents a collection of statements, strategies, plans and figures but very little of it has been applied to good effect. The Keating Labor Government has been unable to spend as quickly as it thought a lot of the money it had planned to spend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bills we are debating today, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4), demonstrate the complete failure of the Keating Labor Government's economic policy. Even while the annual Budget Bills were being debated in this place, the Government was effectively introducing in the other place a new Budget in the form of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4). This new Budget represents an even more desperate reversion to the old formula of pump priming than did One Nation. At least in the case of One Nation we were offered the possibility of additional provision of infrastructure, particularly in the areas of roads, rail and electricity generation, which have been so badly neglected by this Government. With Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) all we have is traditional, old-fashioned, discredited Keynesian pump priming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) launched One Nation nine months ago, he boasted that the forthcoming year would demonstrate a need for recovery and for jobs which One Nation would address. Where are the jobs he promised for Australia's one million unemployed? They will not come out of an even bigger deficit which has now blown out to $2.3 billion caused by the One Nation package&mdash;a package of promises which this nation simply cannot afford because it is being funded by borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation package promised that the Federal Government's Budget would make positive and beneficial contributions to national savings within four years&mdash;that is, by 1995-96. It was a package which promised that the Commonwealth's total deficit would peak at 2 per cent of gross domestic product in this financial year&mdash;1992-93. But the trouble with these promises is that that is all they are; they have not been delivered. They have never materialised as far as One Nation is concerned, as they have never materialised from past promises of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can go back over Budget after Budget of this Government during its 10 years in office. The forecasts and promises which those Budgets made have never been delivered. Now we see that the present Budget deficit will rise to something in excess of 3 per cent of GDP. That is more than 50 per cent worse than the Government promised in its Budget just a few months ago. So the Government now has a very serious Budget deficit problem which it refuses to recognise and take corrective action on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only real solution to this country's economic problems is a Federal election and a change of government. We need that desperately because the Keating Government has presided over the worst economic record this country has seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The enormity of the Government's ineptitude is self-evident; it is there for all to see. Every day since it was re-elected in 1990 more than 450 people have lost their jobs. We are now fast approaching the situation where we have some 700,000 children whose only parental role models are unemployed. In the last eight years this nation has seen a 26 per cent increase in suicides, with the risk of suicide among unemployed people some 6 per cent greater than the general average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the month of the One Nation launch&mdash;traditionally the month when school leavers begin their tertiary studies&mdash;there were insufficient places at universities and technical and further education colleges to cope with the demand. Well over 200,000 qualified students went home disappointed that there were not places to accommodate them; they missed out on furthering their education for another year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's foreign debt has escalated so that it now stands at more than $19,000 for every taxpayer who is still lucky enough to have a job and to be paying tax. That foreign debt further escalated with the release yesterday of the disastrous trade deficit figures of $1.8 billion. In the last financial year this country had more than 18 1/2 thousand bankruptcies, the highest number on record for any one financial year. This figure represents a 278 per cent increase since the Hawke-Keating Government was elected, and a 117 per cent increase since the last election in March 1990. That represents nearly 40 bankruptcies a day since that election, which is a tragic yardstick of our economy's poor performance. Bankruptcies do not affect only businesses; they affect individuals. Nationally, it is worth noting that now one in every 255 households has a bankrupt amongst its members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an absolute disgrace. In Senator Crane's State the figure is one in 174&mdash;which is the worst bankruptcy rate in Australia&mdash;demonstrating not only this Government's detrimental effects on the people of that State, but also the detrimental effects of the Western Australian State Government. In my own State of South Australia, one in 175 households has a bankrupt. In 1991 in South Australia the figure was one in 221, so we can see how the situation has worsened in the 12 months between 1991 and 1992. Nationally, the figure has worsened from one in 331 households in 1991 to one in 255 households in 1992. Those figures represent personal, individual bankruptcies, not business bankruptcies. They are bankruptcies which affect individual households and their capacity to provide for their families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the first Hawke Government was elected nearly a decade ago, average farm income has fallen by 43 per cent from $29,280 to $20,500. We now find that 25 per cent of all broad acre farms have debts in excess of $130,000. There are staggering debts of more than $194,000 for 25 per cent of livestock and crop combination farming properties, and debts of some $350,000 for 12 per cent of wheat and other crop farms. Again, we find that a very important sector of the Australian community which is an important contributor to the Australian economy is in a very parlous situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has an appalling record in a number of areas of its responsibility. Despite a massive increase in fuel excise receipts, we have not seen the level of road funding maintained. What we see at the Federal level is reflected in the individual States. In South Australia, in the 12 months to September 1992 unemployment increased by 9.6 per cent. New fixed capital expenditure fell by 25.3 per cent, and public sector outlays as a percentage of gross State product&mdash;that is, public sector spending&mdash;increased by 21.5 per cent, while the gross State product fell by 2.5 per cent. In South Australia we find a Labor government presiding over what is only too well documented economic mismanagement, just as the Kirner Labor Government did in Victoria and just as the Labor Government is doing in Western Australia. Sadder still, it is occurring at the national level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite simply, we cannot trust Labor with money and we cannot trust it to manage Australia's economic problems. We urgently need economic reform. In particular, we need the abolition of those taxes which impact directly on the cost of producing goods and services in Australia, such as the wholesale sales tax, payroll tax, fuel excise, the superannuation guarantee levy and others&mdash;seven taxes which a Hewson Liberal-National Party government will abolish to reduce our cost of doing things. We also urgently need a stronger commitment to the reform of industrial practices with a greater commitment to freeing up the labour market, to the introduction of enterprise bargaining, and to new union structures, including enterprise unions, which will ensure that industrial relations negotiations occur genuinely at the workplace level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, that is something that only a Liberal-National Party government under John Hewson will do. All of these urgent reforms are integral parts of the Fightback package which that government will introduce. With the election of a Hewson Liberal-National Party government at the next election and the implementation of that Fightback package, Australia can be assured that it has new hope&mdash;hope of recovery and hope of a prosperous future. The continuation of this Government offers no such hope. It condemns us simply to a future of dismal economic performance and a dismal life for the Australian community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1992-93 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1992-93. In doing so, it is worth looking at why we are here. We on this side of the chamber have been saying almost since day one that One Nation was a flawed document that would fail. Now the Government, through an unprecedented move, is acknowledging that: it is reallocating money that was allotted through the One Nation statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is this document flawed? Let us look at the roots of One Nation. It was a direct result of the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) stabbing the previous Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, in the back. Having succeeded in that, he suddenly thought that he had better make some sort of national statement. So Mr Keating wrapped it up in a cosy name without really thinking the whole matter through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see from yesterday's current account figures, which have already been mentioned in today's debate that, in adjusted terms, there is a $1.8 billion balance of payments deficit. We also note that, only three months after the Budget, the Federal Government seems unable to meet any of its Budget targets. In fact, as usual, as has been its form, it is off-target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Chapman has just said, Labor governments cannot manage money, nor can they run a business. History shows this. The history of the States over the last 10 years shows this. Not only did the Prime Minister stab the previous Prime Minister in the back, but also he has stabbed one million unemployed people, in excess of another million people who are partly employed and, in addition, he has delivered a real fall in wages in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time has come for this nation to stop fiddling at the edges. One Nation is a nice, cosy name. It sounds good, but it fiddles at the edges. All the Government is doing now is fiddling at the edges; it is not addressing the fundamental problems in our economy. The Government is not addressing what every householder knows; that is, if we spend more money from our week's wages or our month's wages than we earn eventually somebody will come tapping on our shoulder saying, `Because you cannot meet your mortgage payments you will have to forgo your home or your television set or some of your assets'. That is the situation Australia now faces. We in this nation are on the edge of a total collapse. Government members in this chamber and in the other place do not have the courage to address that simple little fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week a number of us were addressed by Mr Terry Ward, the Managing Director of Heinz Ltd. He gave us a personal explanation as to why Heinz decided to invest in New Zealand and not in Australia. It was very simple. He told us that the reforms that have been introduced in New Zealand&mdash;reforms which are reported to have put New Zealand 10 years ahead of Australia in a competitive sense&mdash;have lowered that company's business costs by 30 per cent. He said that, at the same time, the farmers who produce the goods Heinz needs to process to sell to the Asian market have also enjoyed the benefits of the lowering of those costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand has bitten the bullet. It has been prepared to address its particular cost structures; it has been prepared to address the industrial relations problem and move to a much more productive, rewarding system, but Australia has not. One must ask this Government: why does it want to allow New Zealand to beat the pants off Australia? This is precisely what is happening. This was borne out by what Mr Terry Ward told us last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Australian people that Australia must bite the bullet; we have no option whatsoever. I also say that to the Government and the Democrats. I listened with interest to Senator Kernot's unbelievable contribution when she became the apologist for the Government. The Democrats cannot see that One Nation has failed and that this Government has failed. In every aspect of economic management, and in most areas of social management, its answer is to put together more schemes, and not even address the issue of creating real jobs. It continues to talk about mickey mouse jobs. Yesterday Senator Tierney outlined to us the results of one of these mickey mouse schemes that produced no jobs. I have seen it in front of my office. The street has been pulled up and rebuilt three times in less than two years. God only knows what for. We just get different coloured bricks each time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer to Australia's problems is twofold. The first involves a major change to our taxation system and the second involves a major change to our industrial system. I believe that most Australians recognise this. It was borne out by yesterday's fizzer on our national day of sabotage, the national day of shame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties in government will be making a number of fundamental changes to the taxation system and to the cost of doing business in Australia. This will mean the introduction of a goods and services tax. Also, a number of very important safety nets will be put in place to protect the living standards of Australians. First and foremost there will be a massive cut in income tax. I will quote a few figures to show the effect of this on the Australian population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Somebody who currently has an income of $15,000 will have a tax saving of $624 per year; somebody with an income of $20,000 will have a tax saving of $814 per year; and somebody with an income of $25,000 will have a tax saving of $1,185 per year. That is one safety net that will be put in place to offset the change in the taxation system. It will cut down the cost of doing business in this country so that we are in a position to compete with countries such as New Zealand. I understand that as of yesterday the Polish Government is moving down the line that New Zealand has taken, yet Australia hangs back in terms of being prepared to face the real issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, other safety nets that we will put in place to protect ordinary Australians will include reducing the price of fuel for motor cars by approximately $11 every time people fill up their tank, and businesses will be even better off. We will double the family allowance, from $520 a year to $1,040 per year for a family earning $30,000 or less with one child. Those who require the family supplement because of this Government will have that family supplement increased by 6 per cent. The income tax threshold will be raised from $5,400 to $7,000. All pensions will be raised by 8 per cent, and other benefits will be increased by 6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tax credits will be introduced for private health cover for people earning less than $30,000 per year. We will address the problems in our current health system&mdash;the long waiting lists, the demoralised attitude of people who work in the health system, and the problems that doctors regularly identify. Pensioners and self-funded retirees earning less than $30,000 per year will be eligible to apply for a special cash cheque of up to $2,500 for single people and $5,000 for couples to compensate for the effect of the GST on savings. All people over 65 will be given a pharmaceutical benefit concession card. I could go through the list of all the safety nets that will be put in place. Unfortunately, as we each have only 10 minutes to speak on this matter, I cannot touch on any more of these points at this time. However, I will address them later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that this nation cannot and should not go on in the way it is. It cannot afford the excesses of the current Government and its lack of policy. It cannot afford or tolerate any longer the Government's inability to come up with policies which will fundamentally address what we have to face today&mdash;our burgeoning debt; our burgeoning unemployment; the inability of the vast majority, if not all, of our businesses to compete; and the continuing blow-out in the number of bankruptcies in this nation. The time for change is here. The time for the Government, in the little time it has remaining, to show a little bit of courage and to address some of the issues before us today has long gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even yesterday, the Government could not come out and say to the ACTU and to the Victorian Trades Hall Council, `Now is not the time to hold this country to ransom. Now is not the time to rule this country by anarchy'. Instead, the Government sat back in silence. It lacked the courage of its convictions to tell its masters that the time to pull off and let Australia get on with doing business was right now. In other words, the Government has no guts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleagues who have spoken before me in this debate have explained the nature of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and their rationale.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite simply put, that mess is a tangible example of Labor's mismanagement&mdash;its inability to even manage this year's Budget. No wonder Labor has not been able to manage the country in the last nine years. The money simply could not be used in time. All the plans and projections that Labor had just a few months ago have proved yet again to be wrong. We have these additional Appropriation Bills coming in to reallocate some money for pre-election, gimmicky job creation projects to get people off the statistics and out of the dole queues, so that when the election comes up in March-April Labor will be able to say, `Look, there has been a fall. Our policies are working'. </PARA>

As this Government runs into this election, it will try anything to alter that unemployment figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is happening in my little area. I will guarantee that the same thing is happening everywhere else in Australia, in every small town, provincial city and large town. This Government is doing anything, spending any amount of our taxes, simply to get those people off the statistics in time for the election. It does not matter what it costs or what it does to the economy, to the ALP it only matters that they are off the statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am ashamed to hear that a fellow Queensland senator, Senator Kernot, simply as an apologist for the left wing of the Labor Party, has supported the sorts of things the Government is doing. The Labor Party understands this but does it deliberately for political purposes; I do not think the Democrats understand. I say to Senator Kernot, `We cannot go on with these sorts of unfunded projects'. The Government is borrowing more money on the international Bankcard and adding to our $150 billion debt simply for political purposes. Senator Kernot should know that we cannot keep doing that. What we have to do for this economy is to attack the root cause of the problem, and implement the major reform that is needed; not just splash about money that we do not have to get people off the dole queues for a short period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Bills again exemplify the shambles of management of this Government; the absolute failure of, and the death knell of the One Nation statement&mdash;that much lauded statement that was going to save Australia. Again, it proves that, where money and jobs are concerned, we simply cannot trust the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put that statement in perspective, if the three eastern States were to devote all of their expenditure to the repayment of debt, the entirety of the debt owed by each State would be completely paid off in the following number of years: in Queensland, which had 26 years of sensible non-Labor rule, if all the expenditure of those three States were used, the Queensland debt would be paid off in 1.5 years; in New South Wales the total debt would be paid off in 8.5 years; in Victoria it would take 111 years to pay off the debt. That just shows that Labor's management of money is an absolute tragedy and disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In South Australia there has been the State Bank collapse. That is more evidence of the Labor Party's financial irresponsibility, proving again that we simply cannot trust Labor with either money or jobs. Then there is the scandal of Western Australian Inc. It proved only one thing for the Labor Party in Western Australia: the only way it can handle money is when it is sent around in brown leather satchels for Labor Party political purposes. When it comes to managing the economy of that State&mdash;as it is in this Parliament, Victoria and South Australia&mdash;the Labor Party is completely incapable and irresponsible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What Senator Macdonald says is true: there were another 12 before the ones I mentioned. We should look at the legacy 10 years of Labor Government has left this country. One Nation was supposed to be the showpiece to get us out of all this. It is the failed policies of One Nation that these Bills before the Senate today seek to correct. These Bills make it very clear that One Nation has failed the people of Australia. This Government's policies fail to address the problems that we face. The end result has been record unemployment and the shocking trade deficit released yesterday of $1.8 billion for one month.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be very clear on who has been creating these problems. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when Treasurer, originally led us into this recession. This is something we should not forget. For years we were forced to endure interest rates of around 20 per cent. When the inevitable recession came, the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, promised to engineer a soft landing for the previously overheated economy. Instead, with Mr Keating at the helm, Australia led the world into the worst recession in 60 years. I want to repeat that point to make it crystal clear. While two to three years ago the rest of the world was in the midst of a boom, Mr Keating, our former and failed Treasurer, deliberately led Australia into a recession. He even boasted about it when he said that it was the recession that we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia desperately needs a government that can recognise the problems facing this country. With almost one million people looking for work and an additional 1 1/2 million underemployed, one would have thought that this Government would recognise that serious policy changes are necessary. Instead, it keeps bumbling along, attempting to glaze over the structural problems that have led us into this economic mess, and producing patch-up jobs that do not work. One Nation was typical of the Government's poor attempts at reversing Australia's economic fortunes. One Nation was presented by Mr Keating as a visionary blueprint for strong economic growth that would get people back to work and bring the Budget back into surplus in four years. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS> columnist Bruce Jones said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . since then it has fallen in an ignominious heap: the growth and jobs forecasts proved wrong, the projected surplus is looking sick, infrastructure spending has been revised and promised tax cuts are hardly credible.</PARA>
<PARA>One Nation predicted economic growth of 4.75 per cent. At the time, Prime Minister Keating said he thought that was conservative. He said, `If we cannot make 4 per cent growth a year, we should give the game away'. Well, he should. That is exactly what he should do. He should have given it away before Christmas and given this nation the chance to elect a government which will do something about it. Only six months later, the Budget's economic forecast was a meagre figure&mdash;way under what he predicted. Mr Keating should give the game away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation policy was meant to fix the problems facing this country. It has not done that. What we have experienced from this Government over the last 10 years is not the creation of one nation but the creation of two nations. The two-nation problem that has been created by this Government is shown up in a number of ways. One way we have two nations is that we have eight million people employed in this country and one million unemployed. Another way it has shown up is that we have three-quarters of a million small businesses in this country, but there is another group in which 43 businesses are going bankrupt each day. We have another two-nation measure in this country, and this is probably the most tragic measure of the lot. Three-quarters of the children of this nation go home to a family in which at least one person is working, but one-quarter of the children of this nation go home to a family in which no-one is working and which is welfare dependent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have another example of two nations in this country: the north of Australia and the south of Australia. The northern States&mdash;States such as Queensland and New South Wales which have been dominated by coalition governments over the best part of the last 10 years&mdash;are relatively prosperous compared with the poor southern States of Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia in particular which have had to face the legacy of appalling Labor mismanagement. This is evidenced by the banking and other financial scandals of those States. Again, this proves that we cannot trust Labor with money. The Labor Party has not created one nation; it has divided Australia into two nations in the ways I have indicated and has created the greatest economic disaster since the Great Depression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February, when One Nation was released, Australia's unemployment rate was 10 1/2 per cent. That meant that 908,000 Australians were looking for work. Today we have an unemployment rate of 11.3 per cent, which means that 979,000 Australians are unable to find work due to the policies of this Government. The increase of 72,000 Australians looking for work since the release of One Nation is the greatest condemnation possible of the failed policies of Mr Keating and this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failed policies of this Government, particularly One Nation, can be highlighted through the example of the local government capital works program. Senator Macdonald in his speech mentioned a number of examples of how this ludicrous program had gone off the rails. An amount of $345m was supposed to be used to create 13,000 jobs by providing `funds for projects which will directly create jobs and benefit the economy and the community'. But it is not happening. The Byron Bay Council typifies this appalling targeting of policies that the Government has implemented with One Nation. It shows that this Government has no idea of how the country operates, of how its policies are administered, or of how its policies impact on the community. It also shows that its policies simply are not working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the local government capital works program, the Byron Bay Council was given $400,000. With this money it resurfaced the footpaths in the main street. It took out the footpath that originally existed&mdash;I believe it was quite a reasonable footpath&mdash;and has replaced it with bricks in a wave pattern. Senator Crane gave a similar example of work done in his own town, outside his office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Byron Bay, the area in which this project I referred to was undertaken, has an unemployment rate of 21.8 per cent, yet the Government does not deem it serious enough to warrant ensuring that the money is spent under the program in a way that would ultimately create new jobs. This is typical of the operation of the program as a whole. Councils are using existing staff or contracting out and many of their projects have a restricted capacity to give work to anyone. The projects themselves are frequently one-off activities that will not boost productivity or employment in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday's editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> came close to the mark when it said that it would have been preferable to fund projects which improve facilities and would make it easier for private industry to employ people, because it is private industry that creates real long term sustainable jobs. The attempts at policy by Mr Keating and the Labor Government neglected this very important point. The Government thinks that it can create jobs by throwing government funds into ad hoc programs, but the jobs that are created cease to exist when the money runs out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has not really addressed the structural problems facing the economy and so the unemployment problem remains. The coalition's Fightback package addresses the structural problems that are facing Australia, in stark contrast to the Government's failed policies. The fundamental objective of Fightback, and the one task which all our policy changes are ultimately directed towards, is the creation of more jobs. Expanding job opportunities and stable economic growth cannot be achieved without our economy becoming more internationally competitive, without higher rates of productivity, without a more dynamic and expanding private sector, without higher levels of skills and investments, and without higher levels of savings. The only way this Government can provide a framework in which these objectives can be achieved is to implement a wide ranging reform program focused on building more cooperative workplaces, more competitive businesses and lower and fairer taxes. The coalition's Fightback program is directed at removing the cost disadvantages that are impeding business investment and thus destroying job growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our reforms are designed to create two million jobs over the remainder of the decade. Our industrial relations reforms will ensure that antiquated rules do not stand in the way of people obtaining work. Our tax changes will give people more incentive to find work themselves and more incentive to create work for others. Our sweeping micro-economic reforms will take the shackles off Australian business and give our managers and entrepreneurs the chance to take on the best and win. Our education and training policies will make sure that Australia has the knowledge and skills to take advantage of the opportunities that will open up as a result of the policies I have mentioned. Fightback stands in stark contrast to the Government's failed policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government and One Nation have failed Australia. Unemployment continues to rise and the economy has continued to nosedive. This was evidenced by the figures that were released yesterday. Further figures are coming out today which I believe will show in a devastating way how this Government's policies have failed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is in a crisis. It is on the brink of economic disaster. This was shown yesterday by the fact that we had a current account deficit&mdash;in other words, our imports exceeded our exports&mdash;for the month of October of some $2,000m, the highest figure for three years. This, in turn, adds to our foreign debt, which is now fast approaching $160,000m net. In this climate, massive bankruptcies occur. In the main, they occur not because of the fault of the businesses concerned, but because of external forces: high interest rates imposed by this Government to cut back on the level of imports, which it did, but it shot all the bystanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Government killed those businesses through bankruptcies, they took with them an awful lot of unemployed people. The sad thing about that is that, when these businesses go bankrupt, in the main they never emerge again and those jobs are lost forever. This was the situation that the Opposition saw coming two years ago, notwithstanding the comments made by the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and others that we were somehow enjoying this. It was perfectly obvious that Australia was going down what I think Senator Peter Walsh called `the road to Argentina'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of options were open to the coalition. I suppose we could have done nothing, but we believed that would have been totally and utterly irresponsible, so we decided to bring out an exciting plan to rejuvenate the Australian economy. That is what is needed. It is no good going into bandaids, and short term political fixes are no good. Incidentally, most of them will expire some time in May because this Government is thinking only of the next election. It is not interested in the one million people out of work; it is interested in its own lousy jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We decided to bring out the Fightback package, a most exciting package which offered something for the future. It offered hope to the unemployed and it offered hope to people who would like to invest in wealth creation but have been prevented from doing so because of the structural problems confronting this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole basis of Fightback is to recognise the fact that if a country does not have a viable and growing private sector&mdash;a wealth creating private sector&mdash;no revenue is generated to provide the essential community services that government wishes to provide. Without a healthy private sector, we cannot have a good education system, a good health system, good roads and so on. The whole aim of Fightback is to give a massive injection to this country's wealth creating private sector and give it an enormous boost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is to be handled by taking some $20,000m in taxes off the private sector. These are input taxes which currently are paid by the private sector and which, compared with overseas countries which do not have these sorts of taxes, put it at a disadvantage, not only in respect of exports but also in respect of making the goods in Australia that Australians want to buy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first tax that would come off under Fightback would be payroll tax. This is a tax that has been criticised for generations. It has been a State tax. The States have said, `Well, we would like to get rid of it, but we can't afford to'. We will give them that opportunity under Fightback. Those taxes will be removed and the States will be reimbursed for their loss of income. It is crazy, particularly in the current economic climate with unemployment the way it is, to still have a tax on employing people. It is one of the most ludicrous things that one could possibly imagine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was decided to get rid of the ramshackle, indirect sales tax&mdash;a sales tax that is imposed at the wholesale level and which affects the input costs of business and the final outcome as to the price. A major change we want to make, which I think was probably a surprise to most, involves the removal of the fuel excise levy. The Australian Democrats come in here and say that they want to increase the fuel excise levy by 16c a litre. They are not happy with 26c; they want to make it 42c a litre. That brings it up to the price of petrol today without the fuel excise levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we want to remove the fuel excise levy is that Australia is a large country where goods are transported from one end of the country to the other. This levy impacts on almost every stage of production: for the farmer who brings in his fertiliser before he grows his wheat, in the transportation of the wheat to the mill, from the miller to the baker, and from the baker to the retail shops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cascading effect of getting rid of that fuel excise levy will be enormous. It will save every business 26c a litre in fuel costs. In addition, the ordinary household will, of course, pay 19c a litre less. That means people will pay $11 less every time they fill up their cars. It is all about giving this great adrenalin injection to the private sector so that people can confidently invest their money in wealth creating industries, whether that be in exports or import replacement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next matter which has to be addressed is one that we debated yesterday. This country cannot go along with the old-fashioned, centralised industrial relations system that we have had since 1901&mdash;for 90 years. There has to be a better way, and we propose a better way under the Jobsback package. I make it very clear that Jobsback is all to do with increasing productivity. I have said time and time again in this place that wage levels per se are not the problem in Australia. If we look at the actual wage levels paid in Australia compared with, say, Japan, we will see that the Japanese wages are double the Australian wages. The reason they are double is that the Japanese are more productive. Because they are more productive, they are able to be paid a higher real wage than we can pay in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the whole thrust of our package: to be able to give people the freedom to engage in enterprise based bargaining with their employers. We need an attitudinal change so that there is a recognition that upon the success of a company depends the success of its own employees. If the company succeeds, the employees succeed. They benefit: they get an increase in real wages because of an increase in productivity. Of course, if the company fails, they lose their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another part of Fightback is most important. Under our income tax system at present, there is the most incredible disincentive for people to work a bit harder or even to invest. There is also a disincentive to save. For example, if anyone in Australia today earns more than $20,000, whether that additional income comes from work or whether it comes from some investment in a building society or a bank, that person pays 38c in the dollar in income tax. Once people make $35,000, which is just more than average weekly earnings, they pay 46c in the dollar. That is an intolerable situation, and it is one of the reasons why a lot of Australians decided it was better to spend money than to save it. For God's sake, where is the incentive to save or put money in investments when people pay either 38c or 46c in the dollar in tax? That is an incredible disincentive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An effort had to be made to reduce that burden. The Fightback package promises that the threshold below which people will not pay tax will be increased from $5,200 to $7,000. This will mean that an awful lot of casual employees on incomes below $7,000 will not even have to put in a tax return. The tax rate on incomes between $7,000 and $20,000 will be reduced to 16.2 per cent. This means that someone earning $20,000 a year will pay a tax rate of about 11 per cent. That is below Hong Kong rates. There is an incentive for people to work and retain some of their hard-earned income. The tax scale will be reduced so that some 90 per cent of all Australians will pay a tax rate of 30c in the dollar or less under Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the sort of incentive we need. These are the sorts of structural problems that we must address. The bandaids being offered by the Government are exactly that&mdash;bandaids. It is quite apparent that this Government has absolutely no policies to address the disaster that I mentioned earlier&mdash;the economic crisis in which Australia finds itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback offers that incentive. It offers the incentive to business to get up, to move, to export and to start making goods in Australia that people want to buy. It offers the incentive to people to work a bit harder and retain more of their incomes. The alternative of the Keating Labor Government is more of the same. Frankly, I do not think this country can afford any more of what we have experienced under this Labor Government in the past seven or eight years.</PARA>

We are after real policies to address the real concerns of ordinary Australians, who are worried about their falling living standards and their jobs and are horrified at the fact that a Labor government has allowed employment to reach a record 11.3 per cent, without any action or concern being expressed by the senior Ministers of that Party. Senator Ray tries to portray himself as some sort of moderate in his Party. Senator Ray supported this disgraceful strike we saw on Monday. He did not have the guts of Bob Carr to come out and say that with the crisis Australia is facing this strike was utterly intolerable. That is what the Labor Leader in New South Wales said. The Labor Leader in Canberra, Mr Keating, was behind the scenes promoting this strike for his own narrow political interests. As a result, there will be more losses to the Australian economy, more damage to the balance of payments, more people in business going broke and more jobs lost. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These additional Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4 that we are debating today are unprecedented, as all my colleagues have pointed out. They represent, more than anything else, that Labor is a failure, that it cannot handle the economy and, as John Hewson said so eloquently, `No Labor government seems to be able to handle money'. We have only to look at WA Inc, South Australian banking and the dreadful mess that the Labor Government got Victoria into, to understand fully that Labor cannot handle money responsibly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people have asked why we have put forward a policy whilst in opposition called Fightback and why we have this particular plan. All we had to do, they tell me, was to sit back and let government fall into our lap because this Labor Government has created the most unimaginable mess in Australia's history. We have an unprecedented one million unemployed and another million underemployed. Let us make sure that we get the detail right. If people work one day in the week they are not classed as unemployed. So we have one million totally unemployed and one million underemployed. We have the greatest number of bankruptcies on record. Bankruptcies went up 28 per cent last year&mdash;another 17,000&mdash;and this year we have a foreign debt running at $187 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current account deficit is increasing at the rate of $1 billion a month. The current account deficit figure released yesterday was $1.8 billion. Something has to be done. Honourable senators should think about the debt we are leaving our children, and I would like to go into that a bit. If one thinks about it, the mind boggles. We are not even paying the interest. When the coalition parties left government 10 years ago, Australia's foreign debt was $740m. Now it is $187 billion. That is the magnitude of the problem. Yet, we seem to be accepting it. When bankruptcies go up, when unemployment goes up, when our foreign debt goes up, if it is just under business expectation, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) says that they are `beautiful figures'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are we waiting for?  Are we waiting for Moody's Investor Services to downgrade us again?  Moody's have done so three times already. In 1983, when we left government, Australia had the highest credit rating available. Two years later, under a Labor government, it went from AAA plus to AAA. A year later, it went from AAA to AA1. In 1989, it went from AA1 to AA2. Most people do not understand what that means to them personally, but every time business, governments, farmers or private individuals borrow, we all pay an additional risk premium of between 1 per cent and 2 per cent. Australia is just not considered to be a good risk. That 1 per cent to 2 per cent additional interest that we pay flows on to the domestic economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, how are our children going to pay back the deficit? If they could pay it back at, say, $1 billion a month&mdash;and that is not even in the realms of possibility in the next couple of decades&mdash;it would take them 15 years to do so. If we all think of the age of our children now&mdash;it depends how old your children are&mdash;if they are 15 years of age, in 15 years, they will be 30 before they pay it back. But if we are a little more realistic and say that we could pay it back at $500m a month, it would add another 30 years. The 15-year olds would be 45 before it was paid back. So they would be well into their middle age and getting a bit past it before they could repay the debt that this Government is leaving them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have alarming information about how tough it is to get an education. There are 50,000 to 60,000 qualified students unable to get into universities. Nearly 100,000 students did not get into TAFE or other technical or further education institutions. Yes, Labor keeps telling us how wonderful it is; the kids stay on longer in school. They have no alternative. If they did not stay at school, they would be in the dole queues. So they stay on longer at school, and those who cannot get into TAFE or other further education institutions or universities go on to the dole queues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know the pressure that our children experience at exam time. I think that many parents in this place would have just experienced some of those pressures that their children have been going through. It is just not fair. These days the children have to get such a wonderful pass to get anywhere. The pressures on them are just not fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment tears families apart. It is the greatest socially disruptive thing that is possible. One in three of our children are unemployed. One in three children in my State, Tasmania, are unemployed. There is no indication at all that the situation is improving. It is of no use Government members saying, as did the honourable member for Denison, Duncan Kerr, last weekend that `it is a world recession; there is nothing we can do about it'. Well before the world went into recession, Mr Keating said that we were having the recession we had to have. Honourable senators will remember that he personally took responsibility. He said, `It is my fault'. He apologised and gave every family an additional $10 in family allowance. That was his apology for the recession that we had to have&mdash;well ahead of the world recession&mdash;so it is of no use Labor saying that it is a world recession. Mr Keating deliberately held interest rates so high that bankruptcies had to happen. No business which had borrowed money and no farmer who had borrowed money could cope with 25 per cent interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, something had to be done. So John Hewson announced the Fightback package. A tremendous amount of work went into Fightback. It is the Opposition's plan to get Australia out of this mess and turn it back into the competitive nation that it used to be. The Opposition has made its plan very clear. It will abolish $20 billion worth of taxes on business. Why will it do that? It is so that business can expand and so that our exports will be competitive overseas. At the moment, we cannot send any of our exports overseas without taxes being levied on them. We cannot be competitive while those taxes remain on our exports. Other countries do not have those taxes on their businesses. We, in Australia, do. </PARA>

How many people realise that at the moment 20 per cent wholesale sales tax is paid on washing powder? That is just one example. Have honourable senators ever wondered why washing powder is so expensive? I certainly know. Twenty per cent of the price goes to the Government. What compensation does anyone receive for that&mdash;not 1c. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wholesale sales tax, payroll tax and petrol excise are levied on everything. The Government tells us that the tax is not applicable to butter and bread. Of course it is. Wholesale sales tax, payroll tax and the petrol excise is paid on bread and butter from the farm gate right through to the manufacturer. All the manufacturers in Tasmania, my State, pay payroll tax, wholesale sales tax and the petrol excise, which adds to the cost of transport. All the farmers pay those taxes on the goods that they buy. It comes through the whole way to the price of butter in the supermarket. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GST that the Opposition will be putting on butter will not be on the present price of butter; it will be on a much cheaper commodity. The Government is not telling the truth when it says, `All those things will go up by 15 per cent'. It is not a fact; it is untrue. The Opposition has been trying to get across the point that, if we abolish all these taxes on business, the things that we buy will be much cheaper. Then the goods and services tax applies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment business pays to the Government 26c a litre in fuel excise. That will come off under Fightback. There will be no capital gains tax on businesses sold for retirement purposes, so a businessman can sell his business for retirement and he will not pay capital gains tax. We will introduce compensations for the introduction of a 15 per cent GST. I underline that the GST is not a tax on business; every single business input is rebatable. There will be no tax on business, so businesses can expand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go through the benefits that we will give to compensate for that 4.4 per cent&mdash;not 15 per cent but 4.4 per cent&mdash;increase in the cost of living. There will be substantial reductions in income tax. For instance, those earning $25,000 a year will have their income tax reduced by $1,185. The tax free threshold will be increased from $5,400 to $7,000. The family allowance will be doubled for those on incomes under $30,000 and will go up by 50 per cent up to $40,000. The dependent spouse rebate will increase by $300 a year for spouses with children. All pensions will go up by 8 per cent even though, according to the Treasury, the CPI goes up by 3.6 per cent; we say 4 per cent. All benefits&mdash;sole parent benefit, unemployment benefit, Austudy et cetera&mdash;will increase by 6 per cent. Health is zero rated; so there will be no GST on health, or on education. Everyone over the age of 65 will have a pharmaceutical benefits card and thus will not pay for drugs; this also applies to self-funded retirees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be no tax on up to $2,000 in interest on new savings, so people can save interest of $2,000 a year without paying tax on it. The price of petrol will be reduced by 19c a litre, which will be of great benefit when I go round doing my shopping. For first home buyers where the family income is under $40,000 and the applicants are under 35 years of age, there will be an allowance of $2,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback package will pick up the black economy so that all those people who are presently avoiding tax will have to pay it. Mr Kerr has said in Tasmania that the Fightback package is so good that Dr Hewson will not be able to keep his promise. This is the first time that an opposition in any country&mdash;and in particular in Australia&mdash;has had a plan for Australia that is fully funded. It is because it is fully funded, and because the Government cannot find any problems with it or any holes in it, that it tries to get away with besmirching the Leader of the Opposition by saying, `Oh, he is a cold-blooded economist'. The reason those opposite say that he is a cold-blooded economist is that he has financed and funded this package completely&mdash;right down to the last dollar. Because they cannot find any holes in the package, those opposite just have to denigrate him with those sorts of expressions. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)That the Estimates committees consider the proposed expenditure contained in the Bills in the same manner and in the same groups as the committees considered the particulars of proposed expenditure for 1992-93 referred to the committees on 20 August 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)That, subject to a subsequent resolution, the Senate adjourn after question time on Thursday, 3 December 1992, to allow the Estimates committees to meet.</PARA>
<PARA>The matters that are the subject of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) are very important matters. Despite Senator Ray's somewhat gratuitous remarks at the end of the second reading debate, this has been a very important and constructive debate and it has been so because the contents of the Bills are very important. What we have in these Bills is a reallocation of considerable amounts of money that had earlier been appropriated in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No. 2). Indeed, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) made the announcements that formed the basis for Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4 before the Senate had even passed Appropriation Bills Nos 1 and 2. So we have in these Bills changes in some important aspects of the Budget. Those matters had been considered by the Estimates committees in the normal process following the introduction of Appropriation Bills Nos 1 and 2. The Estimates committees concluded their deliberations and thought that was the end of it. We passed the Appropriation Bills and then found in here Bills that, in effect, amend the Bills that we had considered in great detail in the Estimates committee process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As there have been some important changes, we believe it is very important for the Senate to have the opportunity, through the normal Estimates process, to consider these appropriations. Some people may be concerned&mdash;I guess I direct my comments essentially to the Australian Democrats on this&mdash;that there will be a time loss involved in the course of action that we are proposing. I believe that the contrary will be the case because, if these matters are not referred to Estimates committees, which would meet concurrently and therefore save time in that sense, we will have a lengthy debate in the Committee of the Whole, and that is a much more time consuming exercise than having the debate conducted essentially through the Estimates committees, with the debate in the Committee of the Whole being concentrated just on the key issues that might have emerged from the Estimates committee hearings and consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I believe that it is not just proper and due process; it will also save the time of the Senate. Certainly, we have no intention to be here longer than necessary. There is also a recent precedent to some extent for this in the sense that the Senate last week agreed to refer back to Senate Estimates Committee F various matters dealing with Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No. 2) which had not been able to have due consideration in the Senate because of the application of the guillotine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So for all of those reasons I have moved this motion on behalf of the Opposition. I hope that it will have support because it will accord with the normal, proper processes of the Senate that we have been rightly jealous of ensuring that we do follow so that legislation can be properly considered. This is very important legislation. I hope that the Senate will, therefore, support my motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened with care to what Senator Short has just said.

We would certainly not stand in the way of the proper scrutiny of that process through the Estimates committees. However, we do feel that it is inappropriate to adjourn the Senate after Question Time on Thursday and essentially to dispense with consideration of all further legislation on Thursday afternoon.

<PARA>That would allow the Senate to continue with its business on Thursday, as has been laid down&mdash;and we all know the amount of legislation which we have before us&mdash;and would allow the whole of Friday for the Estimates committees to meet.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also recognise, as Senator Short has done, that in many respects sending these matters off to the Estimates committees could potentially reduce the total amount of time spent in their consideration in the chamber. We would, therefore, have liked to have added a fourth part to this motion which would have read, `That consideration of these Bills for the remaining stages be limited to two hours'. So there would be a full consideration in the Estimates committees but those matters which were of some substance would be limited in the debate when they came back to the Senate to be considered in the Committee of the Whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I am informed that to attempt to place a limitation on consideration of legislation through this process is not an appropriate way to proceed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that that would satisfy both considerations, namely, the Opposition's concern that these changes be considered in the Estimates committees, that the consideration of legislation not be impeded by moving the consideration of the Estimates committees to Friday, 4 December and also that there be a firm undertaking that the consideration of the remaining stages be limited to two hours.

Estimates Committee B deals with the departments of Finance and Treasury and therefore it is appropriate that the Bills be referred to that Committee. But there are other Estimates committees that are perhaps even more relevant in terms of the consideration of the details of these Bills. Estimates Committee C, for example, in particular deals with transport and communications. The essence of the Bills in terms of the money actually lies in the area of transport. Therefore, it would be very remiss of the Senate not to have the views of Estimates Committee C in the consideration given by it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, Estimates Committee C deals with the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories and there is significant expenditure being reallocated into that Department. So Estimates Committee C is a very important committee as part of this process. So also is Estimates Committee E because it deals, amongst other things, with local government. Part of the proposals contained in the Bills is to put forward into the local government capital works programs an additional $55m from that which had been allocated for 1993-94. So Estimates Committee E really does need to consider those proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Estimates Committee F, which is involved in the consideration of employment and training schemes, is very important as well because a significant amount of the money that is being reallocated from transport and other areas is going into labour market programs. It is simply not possible for Estimates Committee B to consider in the appropriate detail required the content of those proposals. Just to limit the reference to Estimates Committee B would essentially defeat the purpose of the Opposition's proposal. If Senator Ray is concerned about not having particular Estimates committees named in paragraph (1) and paragraph (2) of my motion, then I am certainly happy to name them, but it would have to be more than Estimates Committee B. They would need to be referred to Estimates committees B, C, E and F. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the guillotine proposal is concerned&mdash;it is not part of the motion at the moment, as I understand it&mdash;we would be totally opposed to that. As an essential matter of principle we believe that Appropriation Bills should be debated without guillotine. It would be a major setback to the proper processes of the Senate if we were to guillotine the debate on those issues. I give an assurance on behalf of the Opposition that we would restrict the debate to the most appropriate time. There would certainly be no attempt at filibustering&mdash;indeed, quite the contrary.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it the Australian National Training Authority Bill 1992 and the Vocational Education and Training Funding Bill 1992. Both of these Bills concern TAFE. The first seeks to establish the Australian National Training Authority and the other is in the usual annual form to provide moneys for technical and further education throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak on behalf of the Opposition in noting that we will not be opposing the second reading of either of these two Bills. However, I make it clear that, in the Opposition's view, there are some significant questions to be asked about these measures&mdash;particularly whether the policies they embody for training are the best ones for Australians and for the economy into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad to see that the Selection of Bills Committee has already had its report adopted, which will see the Australian National Training Authority Bill 1992 referred to a sitting of the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Training in the coming weeks. On behalf of the Opposition, I requested the Selection of Bills Committee to make that reference. We will certainly be looking forward to the most careful examination of the Bill by the Senate Committee. I am confident that all of the members of that Committee will be able to hear witnesses from the States, the States being the principal area of government that is currently responsible for technical and further education, and to hear witnesses from the TAFE systems themselves. We do not want to see any lack of clarity in the Senate dealing with the proposal to establish the Australian National Training Authority. In my speech, I will be referring to a number of the questions that I believe ought to be examined by the Senate Committee to which this Bill will be referred at the end of this second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National Training Authority Bill implements the compromise agreement reached earlier this year between the Commonwealth and the States for a national framework for technical and further education in training. The authority to be set up by the Bill will be the channel through which both Commonwealth and State funding in this area will be provided and will answer to a council of the relevant Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers where, I observe, the Commonwealth seeks to maximise its influence by claiming two votes and a casting vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Senate we need to ask: what are the short and long term training needs of our economy&mdash;the needs over the next few years and over the coming decade or two? Will the legislation for this proposed ANTA structure really be the best way of meeting those needs? There has already been a lot of debate about this by State Ministers, not least by the Labor governments in South Australia and Western Australia, because, as the Senate will recall, it was the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, who, in a quite unrepresentative and provocative way, announced a national, central, unified training authority through which decisions about technical and further education would be made and that the States would just have to accept that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the Constitution outlines the rights of the States of Australia to determine technical and further education. Those rights would be grabbed by the Commonwealth and the bait, or the reason for the States succumbing to the Prime Minister's rather provocative statement, was that all Commonwealth money for TAFE was contingent upon the States accepting this new centralised, national authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome of the debate that ensued after the Prime Minister's statement has led to a much more diluted compromise outcome. It is an outcome which it appears the State governments have accepted, but with some genuine reluctance. A number of details involved with this authority concerning staffing, funding and the actual mechanism of how money flows from the States to this authority and then back to the TAFE system in the States is the thin edge of the wedge to subvert TAFE from the States. In the same way it could be argued that 20 years ago universities and their governance were subverted from the States by the Whitlam Government. Again, it was on the basis of moneys from the Commonwealth being available to the States for their universities only if the States agreed to the conditions that were being laid down by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the argument for a national framework for higher education is compelling and convincing. The Liberal and National parties seek the return of autonomy to individual universities now that that 20 years of national framework has been achieved. We want to see an end to centralism in higher education. These are early days with regard to TAFE. This legislation takes tentative steps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is much less of an argument for taking the initiative away from the States in an area in which training needs can be defined by the States, with national input; in which those who do receive training will be employed locally; and in which the employers and employee organisations can have a large say in how that training is defined and provided. For those reasons there needs to be a careful examination of these issues by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. There are grounds for real doubts about the effectiveness of the Government's approach, and the Senate is entitled to inquire further into what is being proposed. I ask that the Committee, in considering its evidence, not shorten its examination. I contemplate that it will be in the New Year that we will receive the report of that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Vocational Education and Training Funding Bill provides funding for TAFE in the usual manner for education funding purposes, with supplementation for 1992 and then funding for each of the years of the coming triennium&mdash;that is, 1993, 1994 and 1995. The Opposition accepts the need for increased levels of funding in this area. We accept the advantages of triennial provision. The Liberal and National parties' commitment is to an even higher level of resources and an even higher level of Commonwealth assistance for technical and further education in the coming triennium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has promised an increase for technical and further education of $720m over the coming triennium; the Liberal and National parties promise an increase of $945m. On the election of a Hewson government early in the New Year, we will see that promise brought into effect, to the enhancement of technical and further education throughout Australia. For the time being, we do not oppose the funding provided in the normal way in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to elaborate on my concerns about technical and further education. I remind the Senate that the coalition when in government had a very good record on vocational education funding. A former colleague, Senator Sir John Carrick, when Minister for Education in the Fraser Government, did an enormous amount to uplift the status of the TAFE sector. It received substantial boosts in funding at a time when other sectors of education were not so favoured. Important foundations were laid in those years. The history of TAFE over the last decade under Labor rule is, in contrast, by no means satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> When the Prime Minister described the present situation in Australia for TAFE he said that we were in a training emergency. That is after 10 years of Labor. These are the Prime Minister's own words. That was how he described our plight when he announced the formation of this training authority. This reflects very badly on Labor's policies over the last 10 years. This is an abysmal achievement by the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see in this Bill Labor's approach of seeking to have Canberra dominate decision making and intrude on the decision making that occurs at State and local levels. There are requirements for the States and the authority to develop training profiles for the training agencies of the States. I am reminded of the massive changes and disruption this Government has caused in the field of higher education with centralised intrusion, including compulsory profiles to be submitted to the bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no wish to see that type of failed approach being inflicted on TAFE. The provision of growth moneys over and above present funding levels is to be conditional on satisfactory profiles being developed. Again, that is central intrusion. This is not an approach that gives me any confidence. We know that the Prime Minister wanted a much greater level of Commonwealth takeover of TAFE than is in this Bill, but his first moves were thankfully resisted right around the country and we have this compromise that I have described. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's whole approach to training is, of course, part of its wider agenda for industrial relations in this country. We see Labor clinging to its centralised system, not seriously moving away from it, as the Opposition urges. Many of the proposals coming out of Labor's present system tie training to nationally imposed standards and criteria and link training with national awards. There is no recognition that our focus must primarily be on the enterprise, not the industry, if we are to make the progress and productivity that Australia needs. Training must relate to the needs of enterprises if it is to serve a useful purpose. That is why the Opposition's plans for decentralising decision making and maximising the autonomy of TAFE colleges are the right way to go, so that colleges are responsive to the requirements of the firms in the areas they serve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is clearly locked into the highly interventionist pattern of the ACTU document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia reconstructed</EMPHASIS> and the Carmichael report. We have seen the failure of the Government's Australian traineeship scheme, based on employer subsidies. The Government had set this up with a target of 75,000 each year. But the numbers being trained in this way have never reached such a target. In the last two years, I understand the numbers involved have been only 9,000. That is a long way short of the Government's aspiration. So the history of this Government's efforts help us to understand why the nation is now facing, in the Prime Minister's own words, a `training emergency'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill as it stands has some odd features, which deserve careful inquiry by the Senate Committee. For example, the States are to pay their own funding for TAFE to the Authority and are guaranteed by the Bill that they will then get that amount back. This seems to me to be rather pointless. The aim of the Government is, I suspect, that this process is part of building up the involvement of a national level authority in the funding process, so that it becomes a lot easier for nationally determined priorities to be imposed upon the States and colleges, regardless of their own wishes. I oppose centralism. The Liberal and National parties oppose centralism. We welcome national inputs to form goals and objectives, but we do not wish to undermine the autonomy of the States or colleges in the important area of education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also curiosity about the staffing arrangements. The Bill allows the Authority to hire staff, either under the Public Service Act or independently under agreements.

This is consistent with our Fightback declaration that we would make available $75m a year for the seven years remaining in this decade. It happens that that $75m, in the three years involved, is the $225m in addition to that which is already being provided by this Government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer him to the release today of Australia's foreign debt figures, which show another record level of net external debt of $163 billion, with gross debt exceeding $200 billion for the first time, or more than $11,000 for every man, woman and child in this country. I note that these debt levels are almost 10 times greater than when Labor came to office in 1983, and that, in every year Labor has been in office, Australia has had to borrow $14.5 billion from the rest of the world to pay for our declining living standards. I ask: in the light of this staggering increase in debt, which is continuing to increase at the rate of $1.5 billion each month, when, under this Government's policies, will this mountain of foreign debt start to be wound back?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That question is charged with economic illiteracy and a lot of rhetoric. When we come to address some of the fundamental issues of this country and look at what the Opposition says about these issues, we get some clue as to what this is all about. His Deputy Leader and colleague, Senator Short, who has been on the attack about some of these issues, was saying 18 months ago that the current account deficit, which is one of the main problems with the level of debt, was a symptom of the real cause of the problem which he said was inflation. We have about the lowest level of inflation in the OECD. Senator Short's prognosis of that period shows just how ridiculous the Opposition is on these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What matters most about foreign debt is the ability to service that debt. It is all very well to give these dramatic sorts of figures&mdash;$11,000 per household and all that sort of stuff&mdash;but the debt servicing ratio has fallen as interest rates have fallen and exports of goods and services have risen. The ABS figures show that the economy is better able to service foreign debt than it was a year ago, with the debt service ratio being 15.4 per cent, coming down from 19.1 per cent a year ago. Rather than 19 per cent of exports of goods and services being required to pay the interest on the net foreign debt, now a lesser figure of 15.4 per cent is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point again&mdash;I think it is an important one in view of some of the economic illiteracy on the other side&mdash;that the private sector continues to be responsible for the bulk of Australia's external debt. Private debts account for 61 per cent of the net foreign debt, State governments owe 21 per cent and public enterprises owe 21 per cent. This Government was a net foreign lender to the tune of $4.7 billion. The Commonwealth Government contribution reduces the foreign debt&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Government stands by the award system in Australia which has served this country well for nearly a century and offers minimum protections for workers so that they cannot be exploited. I have a document which I will table which is a proposed individual employment contract put to workers in Victoria. It is the sort of contract which establishes beyond any doubt, according to any reasonable judge, that the offer is based on a `take this contract or be sacked' style of negotiation. It is in fact a contract which reduces significantly the income of workers, despite the undertakings of the Victorian Liberal Party before the election that it would not do so; undertakings which have an ominous ring of familiarity in relation to those given to Australians by Mr Howard and Dr Hewson.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a contract to a first senior assistant in the retail store Copperart. A first senior assistant equates with the classification job manager in the State electrical, furniture and hardware shops award. The contract proposes a $12 hourly rate for 38 hours, with an abolition of rates for working late on Thursday and Friday nights and no special rates for working all day Saturday. Sick leave entitlements have been reduced and a number of other allowances that workers are entitled to as minimums under the State award are reduced as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we total up the effect of this contract, the reduction in wages for a person who signs on&mdash;threatened with the only alternative of being dismissed&mdash;is $41.86 per week. This is a reduction of $41.86 per week for a worker who is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a highly paid worker. Under this contract, there is no provision for better productivity, further training or anything of that nature at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The actual effect is greater than $41.86 when we consider the other benefits. Before the State election in Victoria, a document was circularised by the Liberal Party in Victoria which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. no person in employment will suffer any loss of award wages or conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say that this will ensure every worker who does not voluntarily enter into an agreement with his employer will not lose a cent in salary. The contract by Copperart gives the lie to that undertaking and proves that employers, in some cases, will attempt to use the provisions in the Kennett legislation to exploit their work force in a way which allows them no access to their award and no access to independent arbitration.</PARA>

This contract also contains a series of conditions, and if someone signs it he can be summarily dismissed for misconduct. One of the conditions is loitering in the toilets unnecessarily; they are instantly dismissed with total loss of entitlement.

Given that Australia requires real economic growth well in excess of 3 per cent per annum to even halt the rise in unemployment, let alone reduce it, I ask the Minister: does he concede that today's economic growth figure of 0.5 per cent means that unemployment will continue to rise under this Labor Government until well into the new year and almost certainly beyond if the Government persists with its present failed policies; and, further, does he finally concede that the Labor Party's phoney growth forecasts contained in the Budget of 3 per cent, just as with the One Nation forecast of 4 per cent, will not be met?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Security Council has very strongly reaffirmed its commitment to the peace settlement process with Resolution 792 passed last night. It covers four main areas: the conduct of elections, responses to the Khmer Rouge's present intransigence, a reshaping of the UN's military role, and the question of economic and financial assistance. The elements of the resolution are broadly in accordance with the agreement that emerged out of the Beijing consultations which I attended a few weeks ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of elections, the Security Council has reiterated that general elections must go ahead as scheduled in April or May 1983, but without closing the door finally on Khmer Rouge participation. May I say in this respect that the auguries for those elections in organisational terms are very good. By the end of this week 2.5 million people will be on the rolls of registered voters. Repatriation of the 350,000 displaced persons is expected to be completed, on present rate of progress, by the end of February.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The elections are to go ahead in all areas of Cambodia to which the UN has full and free access as at 31 January 1993. That sets, in effect, that date as a deadline beyond which the Khmer Rouge cannot expect to participate in the elections even if they state an intention to do so after that time, because of the practical difficulty of organising an election with their participation. The resolution also refers to the possibility of early presidential elections, but only on the basis that they are held around the same time or in conjunction with the general election for the constituent assembly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the resolution condemns the Khmer Rouge's intransigence and demands that they fulfil their obligations immediately under the Paris agreements. It proposes a number of measures which are designed to put pressure on the Khmer Rouge and at the same time demonstrate that their intransigence will not be cost free. The parties concerned are to take measures to prevent the supply of petroleum products to any Cambodian party not complying with the military provisions of the agreements. UNTAC is to establish all necessary border checkpoints. Neighbouring countries are asked to cooperate in that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The moratorium on the export of logs which has already been agreed will be implemented and enforced by UNTAC from 31 December.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have not yet had any reaction from the Khmer Rouge to the resolution last night, but there is no particular reason to assume in the short run any change in their position of political opposition. They have announced, however, the formation of a new political party, the National Unity of Cambodia Party, to coincide with the adoption of the resolution, but they have not yet sought to register it with UNTAC. In a statement accompanying the announcement of the new party, they repeated their former unacceptable conditions for re-entering the peace process, namely to do with Vietnamese presence in the country, allegedly, and the operation of the SNC, and those conditions cannot sensibly or easily be met. As a result, there is no great expectation that they will change their spots. The big question is whether they will translate that political opposition into any full scale military reaction of a kind that would require some rethinking of the whole peace process. Our assessment is that there are still very reasonable grounds for optimism that the basic elements of the settlement will be able to be implemented to enable a democratic election to take place in April or May next year. I emphasise the importance of the Security Council resolution, demonstrating the commitment of the international community still to achieving that.</PARA></TALK.START>

Does the Minister accept that Australia's chronic balance of payments deficits represent an economic time bomb which can be defused only with urgent and substantial changes to industry policy? Will the Government abandon its hands-off approach to industry development and, instead, identify those imports which Australia has the greatest potential to replace with local production and provide temporary protection and assistance to help new local industries get started?

There are all sorts of structural reasons for unemployment in Australia, but the current level of imports is not one of them.

It is not simply a question of information. Only before lunch I was reading the Australian Youth Policy in Action Coalition's November newsletter which, amongst other things, for example, speaks of non-penetrative sex being an area where norms and attitudes are changing amongst young male gay people. This is an important aspect of the cultural change that needs to occur in relation to the presence of this epidemic. So there is a gap between knowledge and behaviour.

Our debt to the rest of the world is now more than $11,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia. Even in Paul Keating's banana republic days of 1986, net debt was less than half of what it is today. Mr Keating called that a crisis, so what on earth have we got now? Where are we now?

So let us debate this issue freely now and let the Government tell us how it will correct the $1.8 billion current account deficit figure yesterday or the foreign debt that has run up by 9 per cent to $163 billion net today, or why the growth figures are only 0.5 per cent for the September quarter. That is what we want to know. That is what the Parliament is demanding. That is what the people want&mdash;just some plain, simple answers of what the Government intends to do in the next three months to correct the economy. That is all we want. Surely on the Government side there is someone who can string together a few answers in the next hour or so. That is why I believe this is a matter of urgency that should be debated straightaway.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will not support this motion because it is based on a fraudulent proposal. The fraudulent proposal is that we are not prepared to debate the economy. That is just untrue. We are prepared to debate the economy, but in its rightful place. The stunt by the Opposition of aborting Question Time&mdash;after holding Question Time up as the paragon of virtue in this place&mdash;and pretending that the genuine interests of senators in asking questions can be swept aside, is inappropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday in this chamber we had a debate about the economy. The debate about the economy was during debate on a motion of censure of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and me concerning the industrial relations issues of yesterday.  What actually happened then? I rose to speak on that motion. The time allotted for my speech was 20 minutes. I got to within eight minutes of concluding and then we had an organised, systematic and concerted campaign of endless points of order, and finally a quorum called, to prevent my speaking&mdash;to deny my right of reply to the criticisms that had been made of me and the Prime Minister. So, when the Opposition did have an opportunity to debate the economy, what did it do? By resorting to technicalities and devices, it intended to silence the Government by successive points of order. I would be surprised if I am able to complete the balance of what I have to say now without a point of order from the Opposition to try to stop me, but I will make the effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is not concerned about the economy. The Opposition is concerned about all the opinion polls that are being published lately which converge on one unassailable conclusion: if an election were held in Australia, Labor would win and the Opposition would lose. All of the opinion polls quote that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other reasons why we ought not to go into this debate now is that the Opposition as a corporate entity does not tell the truth about key economic statistics. Only in Question Time today we had, in a staged and ham-fisted way, an organised question to an Opposition front bencher using the Government's Question Time. What did we hear? We heard, as I understood the answer, that productivity in New Zealand was higher than productivity in Australia. I got on the phone and checked with my advisers, who checked the statistics. That assertion by Senator Short is not true. Productivity in Australia is higher than productivity in New Zealand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Opposition wants to have a debate about that in its place, at its time, we will go to the statistics and I will establish that point beyond reasonable doubt. The Opposition uses these occasions to cry crocodile tears about its alleged and faint-hearted concern for the unemployed. That is what this is&mdash;a stunt to pretend sympathy and concern for the plight of the unemployed. A mark of true concern about the unemployed would be what the Opposition is proposing to do about it&mdash;and kicking unemployed people off the dole after nine months, as the Opposition proposes, is not a sign of compassion. It is not a sign of concern. Consigning people to the scrap heap with no unemployment benefits after nine months&mdash;the Opposition's policy under Fightback&mdash;is not a sign of concern about unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition wants to talk down the economy continuously. This is the fourth quarter of sustained positive GDP growth. Company pre-tax profits in Australia rose by 26 per cent in the October quarter, 67 per cent above the recession low. Talking about unemployment, CES unfilled vacancies were up by 24 per cent over the last quarter, the highest since June 1990. Over the quarter, CES job placements were up by 119,000, of which 27 per cent were placements of the longer term unemployed, and ABS job vacancies were up by 10.9 per cent in mid-May 1992. </PARA>

They are most concerned as to what burdens they are placing on the shoulders of their children, who have to repay the debt. I listened to Question Time and I listened to the answers from Senator Button. I am not satisfied with those answers. Senator Button has indicated that we are in a better position to service the debt, growing though it is, than we were 12 months ago. He also said that it is not all public debt; a lot of it is private debt.</PARA></TALK.START>

A lot of industries nowadays, small and large, cannot get the banks to lend on cash flows. The banks are putting the screws on small business. They have had their fingers burnt, but they have not had them burnt by the people who are asking for loans just to keep their businesses going. Where are those people going to get the money? They are going overseas to get the money. It is a situation that I thought the Minister may have addressed.</PARA>

I do not think it is appropriate for Question Time to be thus interfered with because of its importance.

Nevertheless, as the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders has been moved, I will support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have before us another one of these attempts to feign concern about the state of the Australian economy in the hope that the reiteration of bad figures will continue to talk the economy down. Let us remember that there are really four key issues before the economy today: jobs, prices, wages, and the provision of services to people in need. What have we got as a proposal from those opposite? Solving the jobs problem by sacking people; solving the inflation problem by putting up prices; solving the problem of the living standards of workers by cutting their wages and working conditions; and improving services to the poor by slashing Government spending on services. No wonder that at the polls the Australian people have said time and again that they reject the Opposition's proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the four key issues before Australians today, we see that those opposite have precisely the wrong remedy. The problems are clear and their remedies are just wrong; they are absolutely inappropriate. The rest of the world is going in the opposite direction. Dr Hewson says, `Stimulatory policies are entirely inappropriate'. Perhaps we should send him to Japan; he can be a consultant to the Japanese Government, which has just given a massive fiscal stimulus to its economy. After that, we can put him in a plane and fly him to London&mdash;anywhere but Australia. He could advise Mr Major about how inappropriate is the massive fiscal stimulus he has just given to his economy.

But the last thing we need is a government that is proposing to pull out the fiscal stimulus and slow the economy, slow the rate of economic growth, and therefore destroy more jobs. The last thing we need is a government that comes to office proposing a massive increase in prices, a one-off surge in prices&mdash;let us not talk about the equity side of it.

The figure used measured the current account as a percentage of the GDP. If we look at the year 1992 and the forecast for 1993, according to the figures&mdash;and the figures were compiled before the current blow-out in the balance of payments&mdash;the deficit in Australia as a percentage of GDP in 1992 was 3.5 per cent. I stress that this does not take account of the recent dreadful figures. When we look through that table&mdash;Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Holland, Italy, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the US are listed&mdash;we see that only one other country, Canada, has a higher deficit as a share of GDP. In other words, Australia is one of the worst performing countries amongst comparative economies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we go to 1993&mdash;I stress again that these figures were compiled before the recent figures were produced&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> forecast that the current account deficit as a percentage of GDP will be about minus 3.9 per cent. No other country amongst the countries I have named has a figure as high as that. In other words, the crisis in Australia with the balance of payments is very serious, and we are certainly amongst the very worst. As far as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> is concerned, for next year Australia will stand alone as having the worst balance of payments crisis. </PARA>

Its problems are different from those of Australia. </PARA>

Of that seasonally adjusted $1.8 billion deficit figure&mdash;the real figure being in the vicinity of $2 billion&mdash;the vast, overwhelming proportion is the cost of servicing our existing debt. To find that Australia puts herself into debt to between $12 billion and $18 billion each year adds to our international debt while the Government stands up and says `It is really okay; we are all doing terribly well' is really tantamount to Nero fiddling while Rome burns. </PARA>

The bailiffs would come in and sell us up, and down would go our standard of living.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to discuss the Australian National Training Authority Bill and the Vocational Education and Training Funding Bill 1992. The former Bill seeks to establish the Australian National Training Authority and outlines the framework within which the Authority will operate. The absence of a national training board has been sorely felt in this country. It is our view that the establishment of ANTA is long overdue, as is a uniform and disciplined national training sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's further education system reached crisis point this year when over 100,000 applicants for technical and further education courses missed out on places. Together with 48,000 unsuccessful applicants for university, these people created the largest bottleneck in our education system in history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year we have had the highest youth unemployment rates since the Second World War. In this climate of diminishing job opportunities and climbing poverty, secondary school retention rates have soared from 57 per cent in 1983 to 67 per cent in 1990, to 71 per cent in 1992, with expectation that these will reach 95 per cent by the turn of the century. The great shame has been that, while our youngest are better and brighter than ever before, we cannot secure employment for them, nor can we provide them with education or training opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government outlays on education as a proportion of gross domestic product have plummeted by almost 10 per cent in the five years between 1984-85 and 1989-90, despite an increase in the GDP of 71 per cent. Our tertiary institutions are overflowing with undergraduates who have to contend with substandard conditions that include overcrowded lectures and tutorials and inadequate laboratory equipment which contravene occupational health and safety standards as well as a scarcity of library books and insufficient staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A feature of the education and training system this year has been the number of unsuccessful applicants for university who then applied for TAFE colleges in the desperate hope of gaining some formal qualification&mdash;often in an area that was not of particular interest to the student. With the abolition of entry-level jobs for many young people, formal training is often the only way of obtaining work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dangerous trap we are falling into, however, is that of producing thousands of graduates each year with little or no prospect of employment. The most recent ABS education attainment and labour force statistics show 59,400 unemployed young persons with a degree. Australia is fast becoming the most highly educated unemployed community in the world. For too long this country has lacked a coordinated national body designed to facilitate the training needs of all Australians. I hope that this legislation will fill that gap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to establish ANTA came hot on the heels of massive youth unemployment and was the main outcome of the Government's youth summit in July this year. The training debate has occupied centre stage for the past 18 months with a proliferation of reports and papers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, earlier debate over training was characterised by blackmail and bluff. The threat of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to the States that they would lose responsibility for TAFE was tantamount to blackmail and made the Prime Minister look like he was riding roughshod over the States and their Ministers. Thankfully, the debate is now more structured and cooperation between the States and the Commonwealth, and between the Commonwealth and the industry sectors, is taking place. This Bill is an outworking of that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Finn review in July 1991, chaired by Mr Brian Finn, Managing Director of IBM&mdash;who will head the ANTA board&mdash;established new targets for participation in schooling, and post-compulsory education and training. Following in these footsteps were the Mayer committee and the Carmichael report, which ensured that training matters remained central to Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendations outlined in Carmichael's report focused on competency based training and the sponsorship of industry-education network committees at a regional level. Pivotal to the implementation of this plan will be the Australian National Training Authority. ANTA will act as an independent statutory body responsible for overseeing the emergence of a national training system in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANTA will be assisted by the current private and State training networks such as the industry training advisory boards which will play an important role in this process. Membership of the board consists of a distinguished panel of representatives whose expertise and industry experience should serve this board well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry has an exciting and vital role to play in the creation of flexible pathways in training and in employment. I am glad to see that ANTA will foster close industry involvement in the growth of a network of training providers. Although interaction between universities and industry has been heightened through technology transfer companies, research syndicates and science parks, in the words of Laurie Carmichael:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A substantial shift in industry towards ownership and responsibility for training and its recognition is needed in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA>However, it is important that the needs of our training and education sectors are not usurped by those of industry. The Opposition has raised serious concerns about basing a national system of certification exclusively on industry standards. We share that concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats also consider flexibility within the TAFE system important in ensuring that the varying demands of enterprises within an industry are met. This does not, however, necessitate a fully decentralised TAFE sector. The Carmichael report envisages a simple structure of vocational training that promotes and enables progression from one level to another in all industries. This incorporates traineeships and apprenticeships but extends them to a much wider range of occupations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANTA will oversee the implementation of such a system and the industry led board will nurture a closer relationship between TAFE and industry in order to meet training needs into the next century. Rapid expansion of the TAFE sector should not be regarded by this Government as a simple solution to the high levels of unmet demand. Simple expansion of the TAFE sector is not a valid means of alleviating the effects of overcrowding, nor of diminishing the dole queues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has yet to grapple with the marked increase in university places and the lack of funds for those places. The solution centres on a target level of growth that is sustainable and ensures that those students undertaking further education are not working in substandard or unsafe environments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite a marked increase in the interest in university between 1984 and 1990 for 15- to 19-year-olds&mdash;15 to 31 per cent&mdash;interest in TAFE has fallen from 22 to 12 per cent for 15- to 19-year-olds. It is interesting to evaluate the problems affecting the TAFE sector and why secondary school students prefer university as a post-compulsory option. This board must iron out existing anomalies amongst TAFE funding and course provision. ANTA must ensure the uniformity of TAFE courses and seek to avoid the problems that beset the college sector in the late 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is growing recognition amongst education and training sectors and government that university is no longer the only post-compulsory schooling pathway. Many negative images about the TAFE sector need to be dispelled, which I hope the ANTA board will be involved in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">TAFE colleges are plagued by high levels of attrition and enrolments tend to be concentrated in short term courses which do not necessarily contribute towards long term acquisition of work skills. There are concerns that traditional TAFE clients such as those undertaking apprenticeships and traineeships and adult education students may suffer under a national training system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must be wary that TAFE colleges do not mirror the role of the colleges of advanced education in the middle level of higher education and the poorer cousin of universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue confronting the tertiary sector is that of competency based training and the not inconsiderable tension between the standards of the professions and those of the work force. Educational institutions and professions have questioned the legitimacy of competency based training in the professions which, by tradition, are considered self-regulatory and strive for excellence, whereas competency based training standards define an acceptable minimum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) to make the implementation of competency based training within educational institutions optional is appropriate, given the disparity between the vocation and training sector and the universities. However, this issue requires further investigation. Along with competency based training, the development of more flexible education and training pathways will be underpinned by effective credit transfer arrangements. Industry sectors have identified concerns with existing credit transfer arrangements and I presume there will be a role for ANTA on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the coalition's fears about ANTA becoming a bureaucratic nightmare, with the proposed funding arrangements by which State funds are pooled with ANTA and then channelled back to the States. In this scenario the States will maintain their training Budgets and the Commonwealth will be responsible for financing the growth in TAFE places. I also concede that the role of the Employment and Skills Formation Council needs closer analysis in relation to ANTA, given that there seems to be considerable overlap in the responsibilities of the two bodies. The needs of people from non-English speaking backgrounds and disabled people in a national vocational training system must be considered and ANTA must seek to ensure that all groups in the community are given equal opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of ANTA has not been without some controversy. The location of ANTA was a matter of debate for some months, with Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane vying for the Authority. Also, the future of as many as 180 public servants has been in doubt, as DEET staff are not allowed to follow their functions into the new Commonwealth-State Authority. All too often, Parliament is expected to rubber stamp the creation of a statutory authority without the implementation of a mechanism through which to scrutinise the workings of these bodies. At the committee stage, I will be keen to see the insertion of a clause that will enable the careful evaluation and scrutiny of this body. Regular monitoring of the board's actions and affairs should take place as a means to not only ensure accountability and effectiveness but also maintain a dynamic approach to industry and training needs in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bring the Senate's attention to an advertisement which appeared in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> calling for a chief executive officer for the Australian National Training Authority. I note that at this time we are still only considering this legislation&mdash;we have not even passed it&mdash;yet we find that the Government has already taken it upon itself to advertise for the position of a chief executive officer. I put it to the Minister and to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the bureaucrats' taking it upon themselves to put an ad in the paper is a huge presumption on this Parliament that we are prepared to simply rubber stamp a piece of legislation and that we will simply pass this legislation without a great deal of comment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators would be aware that this legislation has now been referred to a Senate committee. As Senator Teague indicated, the Committee may choose to report some time in the new year although, as a member of that Committee, I would be a little nervous to consider this legislation for that long. I believe that there are some issues that need serious examination. It would be extremely embarrassing for the National Training Authority, or those bureaucrats responsible for its establishment, if that report were not to come down until some time in January. Yet advertisements have been put in national newspapers calling for a chief executive officer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is another example of the kind of arrogance we have come to expect from this Government on a whole range of education issues. This Government presumes that the Parliament will rubber stamp its decisions&mdash;rubber stamp yet another statutory authority&mdash;without proper scrutiny and without ensuring that all senators have a chance to have their say. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this end, we support a publicly accessible and equitable education system. Fees and charges are a financial disincentive to enter and participate in higher education for disadvantaged groups in the community. Up-front charges, such as those supported by the coalition&mdash;and in some cases in postgraduate and non-award courses condoned by this Government&mdash;are unacceptable. Artificial barriers that determine entry into education and training on the basis of wealth and privilege have no place in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats look forward to the creation of a diverse and flexible education system that will lead us into the twenty-first century. Education and training represent the best investment we can make in that future. It is no secret that a prosperous society is one that is well educated. The formation of skilled labour through the education system contributes to the economic development of the nation. I strongly support the establishment of the Authority but wish to see resolved some of the outstanding questions about its specific functions, its relations with other boards such as the Education and Skills Formation Council and its administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not suggest that the Australian National Training Authority will solve all our training needs, but in our belief it will go a long way towards identifying those needs in the present and into the future.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support the second reading amendment that Senator Teague has circulated, as we do agree that the Prime Minister's statement that we are in a training emergency, after some 10 years of Labor Government, is an absolute outrage. It is an astonishing fact that the Government, after 10 years in office, has suddenly realised that training is an essential element of a competitive economy and an educated populace. We do have concerns about the excessively bureaucratic and centralist character of the ANTA board.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian National Training Authority Bill 1992 and the Vocational Education and Training Funding Bill 1992 are designed to establish and fund the Government's new National Training Authority. This Authority, which will have responsibility for establishing a new national system of vocational education and training, is very much needed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition does not oppose this legislation. However, honourable senators should not think that the mere establishment of this Authority will, by itself, offer a satisfactory national system of vocational education and training. There is a huge task ahead of this nation in this area and a great deal of uncertainty and many unanswered questions still remain on how this particular Authority will operate. Very real dangers exist in the charter and framework being provided for this new body. The size of the task facing ANTA is all the greater because of the quite dramatic failure of this Government in its almost 10 years in office in pursuing policies which would lead to the development of a vocational education and training system of international standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of a national training framework for vocational education and training is essential. Employment opportunities and international competitiveness are dependent on the work force with skill levels of an international standard. However, it is crucial if this country is to have a national framework for vocational education and training that it should be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government does not have a very good track record in terms of appropriate frameworks, particularly in the area of education. The Government has destroyed the colleges of advanced education that were flourishing in this country. These were institutions focused on high quality higher education. In doing so, Australia lost a number of institutions which had established strong regional links. The CAEs had also developed courses which were appropriate for the vocational needs of students in the region and tied in with particular local industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government started out with a very strong foundation in this area of vocational education with the policies of former coalition governments in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It threw this away and neglected the sector for the next 10 years. The result has been devastating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This devastation was clearly pointed out in the Finn report, which pointed to the very serious deficiencies that young Australians are exhibiting in their job-related competencies. Quite simply, the Finn report concluded that there is overwhelming evidence that a very large number of young Australians are emerging from the schooling system with inadequate literacy and numeracy skills. This will not fit them for employment in internationally competitive industries and they may find themselves unable to get jobs at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Carmichael report was produced by the Employment and Skills Formation Council to address the serious shortcomings of the 10 years of Labor neglect as outlined in the Finn review. The formation of ANTA is a direct result of these recommendations. The Opposition supports the concept of a national system of certification for training. However, we have very serious concerns over a system of certification that is to be based exclusively on industry standards. Where industry standards which are appropriate to all enterprises within an industry can be developed, such standards should be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The driving force of national prosperity is not industry itself, but the enterprises that make up that industry. It is vital that the individual enterprises of this country are not trapped into training frameworks that force them to pay for training they do not need. They must also not be locked into training frameworks which discourage training innovation at the enterprise level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key questions regarding this legislation is: will the Authority be an effective vehicle for encouraging the development of a national training market responsive to the needs of industry, or will it become a new source of rigidity and bureaucracy in the training area? Enormous amounts of public money are already supporting the current bureaucracy. Currently, $15m is spent on industry training advisory bodies and there has been no evidence of improvement in the Government's handling of the vocational education and training sector as a result of this expenditure. In fact, it seems that the opposite has occurred as Labor has ignored this sector and now threatens to centralise it as it has done in the university sector. I refer there to the discredited national unified system. We do not want a repeat of that exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be seriously questioned whether the Australian National Training Authority will continue to develop a national training system. Will it be flexible enough to have an effective enterprise focus, or will it persist with the Government's approach of compulsory industry-based standards which may or may not be appropriate to the needs of enterprises?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also provides for the development of State training profiles. This is another area of serious concern. Each State is to give the Authority a profile of its training plans and if the Authority likes these plans it will provide the State with growth money. The system of profiles has failed completely at the university level. It is not an effective system for planning the university system and it is most unlikely to be an effective system for planning the future development and growth of the technical education area. Indeed, it is a system which has a real danger in it in that it will lock TAFE systems into a uniform framework when we need to see developments in the direction of greater flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do need a national framework, but that framework should concentrate on providing for national certification, ensuring that it is flexible. Training should have an enterprise focus and excellence in programs for both public and private providers. The coalition acknowledges that there is a clear public responsibility for entry level general vocational training. However, that training must be appropriate to employment opportunities in industry and the training system must be closely linked and responsive to the needs of enterprises. The aim of skills training in particular should be to increase productivity and competitiveness and should be cost efficient for enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has set out in Fightback the principles that we believe are important for vocational education. Vocational education and training should be provided through a flexible and open training market with a variety of public and private providers. As far as possible government funding should be directed to people rather than to courses and institutions. This will maximise choice of provider to the person seeking training and avoid the problems which have arisen from centrally regulated and bureaucratic modes of provision. The appropriate national framework is one which provides national standards and national certification rather than one which seeks to detail central regulation of courses and providers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;We are dealing with the Australian National Training Authority Bill 1992 and the Vocational Education and Training Funding Bill 1992. I do not want to reiterate those things about which I think the Senate is essentially in agreement, but I think in discussing those things about which we are in disagreement we can too easily overlook the fact that we have here legislation to implement a major step forward, a very positive contribution to the Australian national training arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Opposition moves amendments to a Bill's second reading, one tends, in summing-up on behalf of the Government, to respond to negatives. However, I want first to make it clear that the most important part of this is the recognition that what we are implementing here is a major step forward, something that is very important for Australia now and into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to recognise that the predominant responsibility for TAFE has always been with the States. This Bill is instituting a change in the balance of responsibility between the Commonwealth and the States for technical and further education. I think that is an appropriate move by the Commonwealth, but not one that has been easily made. It is in the nature of our Federation that such changes are often resisted. If they are going to be implemented on an agreed basis rather than through a process of confrontation, it often takes time and compromise. We often do not wind up with what would be the ideal model if we were proceeding under a unified system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having made these two opening remarks, I would like to respond briefly to the Opposition's amendment and to one issue that was raised by Senator Sowada. In response to the Opposition's amendment, the Government has been actively pursuing the goals of increased participation in post-compulsory education and its policies have seen significant improvements in school retention rates and a substantial growth in higher education places. These improvements have been accompanied by an active role in pursuing a national training reform agenda, the goals of which have included a significant expansion in both public and privately supported funding, the development of a competency-based rather than a time serve-based system, and the development of industry defined skill standards and national recognition of trainers and credentials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has also in its approach acknowledged, and acknowledges, the constitutional powers of the States in education and training, but it recognises as a parallel issue the need for a truly national and properly funded vocational education and training sector. The decision to establish the Australian National Training Authority is part of a broader agreement between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories to establish a national vocational education and training system with a secure funding base, a consistent national approach to planning, and an independent statutory authority to oversee the vocational education and training system, with a board of acknowledged experts and strong industry representation. The Authority will be responsible to a ministerial council of Commonwealth and State Ministers. Senator Teague referred to the voting arrangements. These reflect the Commonwealth-State agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are often problems, in my view, of proper accountability in bodies that are established through these Commonwealth-State agreements. It has been a long-standing problem. It is inherent in the nature of Federation. I think parliaments around Australia need to give this more attention. In fact, we are getting an international equivalent of that. As we get, for example, agreements with New Zealand in the area of tax and other areas we will find problems of accountability where we have ministerial councils making decisions. The starkest example and the greatest failure was the National Companies and Securities Commission. I do not mean that the Commission as a whole was a failure, though there was some criticism of that, but there was a very real problem of accountability. It was not really accountable to any parliament, and Senator Tate has made that point effectively in the Parliament on a number of occasions. It is obviously a less than perfect model, but it is inherent in the nature of federalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State training agencies will be responsible for the operation or management of vocational education and training. Industry input into the national system, especially through ANTA board membership and the role of the national industry training advisory body network, will help ensure the development of an effective training market. Industry will play a key role in the development of the national strategic plan and the State training profiles. There has already been very strong industry support for the national system and the establishment of the Australian National Training Authority. That is a factor that needs to be taken into account. I think it is important. It is not the decisive factor in isolation, but it is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Bill is going to a committee after its second reading, so most of the matters of detail can be dealt with there. However, I sought some facts to respond to the issue Senator Sowada raised concerning the advertisement for the chief executive officer. This fits in with the timing of the announcement of the board membership by the Minister. The Government has explained in the second reading speech the need for preliminary work to be undertaken before the national system starts on 1 January 1994, and therefore certain contingent initiatives are taken. Obviously if the Parliament were to deny the Bill a second reading and defeat it, those things would have to stop. It is standard; it has occurred with the establishment of most such bodies. We get an interim board or an interim chief executive to get the system up and running. Where that has not been done, the Government is criticised for being dilatory, for not proceeding with due enthusiasm and speed to implement the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in the nature of government that to be in government is to choose. When we choose, people complain because we did not choose the other option. Being in government may have its difficulties, but I continue to say that it is a hell of a lot better than the alternative, so it is a criticism I am prepared to wear. I think I would rather be criticised for acting too promptly than for not acting promptly enough; but obviously the decisions are contingent upon the final approval of the legislation by the Parliament. It is such a valuable and worthwhile proposal that I am sure it will be endorsed by the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1992, which contains a number of proposed amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. Some of these results, recommendations or amendments are from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot of delicious irony in this Bill. It puts the final nail in the coffin of some of the more bizarre provisions of the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1992, which set out to ban all political advertising on radio and television 365 days of the year. That Bill was first mooted by one Mr Bob Hogg, who was the successor, I understand, of Senator McMullan in the Labor Party. The Bill was introduced at the beginning of last year. As I mentioned, the whole aim of the Bill was to prevent political advertising on radio and television 365 days of the year, during Federal elections, State elections and local government elections. It was the most atrocious attack on freedom of speech and freedom of political expression this country had ever seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process of getting that Bill supported, the Government wooed the Australian Democrats, who in those days were led by Senator Powell. It was apparent from the discussions we had with the Democrats of that time that the Government had in fact made a deal with the Democrats, and they were hell-bent on introducing this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To counter that, Dr Hewson organised a task force, which was chaired by our ex-colleague Senator Olsen, which did an extraordinarily good job in attracting attention around Australia to this heinous piece of legislation. I myself spoke to many groups, and I think the only people who opposed us were Phillip Adams and the ACTU, apart from the Labor Party and some sections of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the antagonism to the provisions of that Bill, the Democrats used the apparent deal made between Senator Bolkus and Senator Powell to dispose of Senator Powell. It was generally expected that, as a result of that, the incoming leader, Senator Coulter, and his team would not have anything to do with this ridiculous attack on freedom of speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it turned out, the Democrats were prepared to be bought, except the price was a little higher. One of the amendments proposed by the Democrats, which was part of the buying price, was that we were to have a brochure sent out to every elector in Australia, with a photograph and a CV of every candidate in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Apart from the logistics of that little exercise, which could well have meant that the Electoral Commission would have to receive photographs, a CV, a brief description of policies&mdash;I think a 250 word description of policies&mdash;over a 21-day period, the cost to the taxpayer was a minimum of $3m. That was the figure given to me in Estimates by the Electoral Commission, but I often thought that if all the costs had been calculated, bearing in mind that this brochure would have had to go to some 10 million people, the cost would have been closer to a figure of between $5m and $10m. However, this was the cost extracted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is now removing that provision from the Bill, much to the gratification of the Australian taxpayer, and also to anyone who has any understanding of the electoral process. Apart from the logistical nightmare, this requirement to send out a brochure showing the names and policies of every candidate opened itself up to mischief which could have been created in the electoral process. This opened itself up not only to mischief in the form of single issue candidates offering silly things, but also to the fact that even the major parties could have run so-called independents on single issue items in order to pick up a few preferences, particularly in marginal seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other bizarre opportunity arose for local tradesmen in relation to House of Representatives seats. For a small amount of money, one could imagine a local tradesman or the local butcher deciding to run, not really intent on getting into Parliament, but getting his brochure into the hands of every person in the electorate to say he was offering the cheapest meat or the best meat or whatever it might be. So it really was a stupid piece of legislation, and a very silly amendment moved by the Democrats, for which the Government itself was castigated, not only by those members of the public who were aware of what was going on, but subsequently by the High Court which found that the ban on advertising was invalid according to the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to speak at great length, but there are a couple of other items in the legislation that I would like to mention. The brochure that was to go out was aimed at promoting single issue interest groups. Indeed, one of the problems in recent years has been caused by minority groups who represent single issue constituencies within the electorate. It is worth considering the danger of some of those minor groups who can control the Parliament. There are at present three States where the parties now in power owe their existence to independents, namely, Western Australia, South Australia and New South Wales. The Democrats hold the balance of power in the Upper House in the latter two States. There is an argument that such independents provide a check on public policy or serve as the true representatives of the electorate without the need to actually toe the party line. We have all heard that story; it is phoney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with the approach is that despite the superficial attractiveness of that argument, minor parties and independents, by their very nature, tend to represent very narrow views. Often they tend to represent the views of a vocal lunatic minority, rather than the silent majority of voters out there who are responsible for electing whatever party into power. The policies favoured by their parliamentary representatives do not have to be tested against the bulk of public opinion. As a result, there is likely to be a trend towards supporting pressure groups at the expense of the greater good of society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both of the major parties, whatever their policy differences may be, are concerned with a much wider span of interests than the typical independent. The tyranny of the minority is the problem for many Australian parliaments at present. We all live in the real world. The upshot of the advent of a few independents holding the balance of power means that each of the parties must come to an understanding with them in order that the business of government and opposition can go on. I think that we should witness the agreements which the Fahey and Arnold governments have been forced to strike in order to govern, the fluidity of independent support of Dr Lawrence in Western Australia and the mixed-up policies of the Green Labor Alliance in Tasmania, now replaced, of course, by a Liberal Government in its own right. They just do not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No incumbent government likes dealing with minority interests in this way; neither do oppositions like negotiating with them. It is not a matter, as the Democrats have often said, of keeping the so-and-sos honest. It is a matter of extracting deals, and I do not think that is in the best interests of government in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is little hope of any independent or minor party policies ever coming into effect, given the control of the government over Supply in each case. The great beneficiaries are the candidates who find themselves with the national soap box and power well beyond their electoral mandate. I make the point that the situation is perpetuated when candidates are faced with a further test at the hands of the electorate. This was, I think, one of the major problems of the publicly funded guide. It could happen. It could add to a problem that already exists in this country which I believe is not by any means to the benefit of the economy or to the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have one small concern. I may well raise it here. The Government has added a further amendment which entails a penalty on anyone who advertises a voting form which is not in keeping with the requirements of the Electoral Act. For example, I understand that in some past elections&mdash;maybe it was in Victoria where this occurred&mdash;an advertisement was made which tried to convince people not to vote in the normal preferential fashion. The Government has introduced a penalty for anyone who does that by way of advertisement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only concern I have is that if a person does vote, for example, where there are four or five candidates, in the form of 1, 2, 2, 2 as an example, it is a formal vote, yet it is not in accordance with the Electoral Act as a method of voting. It is formal because the intent of the voter is recognised for what it is. So it is there to cover people who do not intentionally do that. The only concern I have is that by placing a penalty on those who would try to persuade others to vote that way is a penalty on something that is, in fact, a formal vote. Perhaps the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) in his response might like to address that question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, let me say that the aspect of the Bill that removes the so-called free brochures, the brochures paid for by the taxpayer, is the final nail in the coffin of what was a most outrageous piece of legislation which sought to ban political advertising on radio and television and thus represented a most atrocious attack on freedom of speech and political advertising in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer talked about the cost to the taxpayer. For Senator Parer's information, I would like to put on the record that the Opposition's advertising on television costs the taxpayers millions of dollars. We all end up paying for the cost of advertising, either through tax deductibility&mdash;that is how taxpayers end up paying it&mdash;or through packaging or whatever. Consumers end up paying the price of advertising. Senator Parer cost the taxpayers millions by introducing tax deductibility for political donations. He did not want it to be limited to $100; he wanted it to be any amount for companies. He had no concern about the cost to revenue of that little measure. So he should not be hypocritical about taxpayers money and the use of it. </PARA>

It is the subject of a new interim report following the original report on the previous election and it makes suggestions for the coming election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of a notional distribution on a two-candidate preferred basis was agreed to by the Committee, with the two options being whether the distribution should be conducted and observed by polling officials, or whether it should be facilitated by polling officials and observed by scrutineers. A subsidiary question was whether this should occur in all divisions or simply in those considered to be potentially close. We have had exhaustive discussion on this in the Committee. We have found a balance that will meet the needs of those who have to communicate the information on election night and those who need to know the results as soon as they possibly can. Through negotiation we have found a reasonable solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also proposes to adopt a recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade that the Electoral Commission have its functions broadened to include providing assistance to foreign companies and organisations where this is approved by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. We support this. One of the great lessons that Australia can bring to this part of the world is that democracy does work: it is self-sustaining if it is properly nurtured. One of the prerequisites, of course, is the right to basic truthful information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst recent figures show that we are having trouble exporting enough of our goods and services to the rest of the world, we have a good opportunity to get behind the Australian Electoral Commission and to export some form of democracy in our geographical region. Cambodia is probably a relevant country to think of in the short term. There are many Asian countries which are fledgling democracies. To the extent that Australia can help to strengthen democracy by providing technical, administrative or any other type of assistance, we should do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Electoral Commission will provide supplements to the electoral roll to sitting parliamentarians and parties by way of computer tape or disk, free of charge to sitting members or parties with representatives in Parliament. Cost recovery procedures will apply to information provided to other political parties or other persons. The use of information from the electoral roll and the habitation indexes is currently limited for privacy reasons and to ensure commercial misuse is not made of information. I will ask the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) a couple of questions about this at the committee stage. A consequential amendment extends these limitations to information provided by way of a computer tape or disk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of privacy is a vital one, and is becoming more so, given the information revolution and the sophistication of the major political parties in direct mailing techniques. The Bill also provides for a new system of automatic enrolment for new citizens to be introduced so that persons applying for citizenship may make a provisional claim for electoral enrolment, which would be activated when citizenship was granted. This is like the provisional enrolment for Australians turning 18 of years of age. It is a good idea. It reduces administrative duplication. It links citizenship and participation in the electoral process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides for a strengthening of the recently enacted disclosure provisions. These provisions should continue to help to clean up the political process. They appear, along with the recession, to have contributed to a marked decline in contributions to Federal political parties. The statutory report concerning the disclosure provisions, which is tabled in this place, is broadened to include a list of the names of the persons who are, or may be, required to furnish a return showing donations to candidates or parties. This is an important provision because it makes this additional category of persons subject to the compliance investigations under the principal legislation. The recent disgraceful WA Inc Royal Commission findings&mdash;the findings were not disgraceful, but what they highlighted about what went on in Western Australia was&mdash;and the recent comments made by anti-corruption officials such at Ian Temby demonstrate the need for a system of full disclosure laws in all Australian jurisdictions. Even though the Commonwealth laws are now of a high standard, there are still jurisdictions which allow secrecy, and these can be used as conduits for secret and dubious donations. I ask the Minister to respond to the issue of what the Commonwealth is doing to get some uniformity from the various States in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current law allows the Electoral Commission to deregister a registered political party if it has endorsed a candidate previously but not for the previous four years. This leaves a loophole where a party can register a name, and hence stop another group from using that name, yet never have to run any candidates in any elections. The power of deregistration is to be extended where four years elapse and the party has never endorsed a candidate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A review mechanism is to be established for the cancellation of `silent' elector status. Also, a voter with `silent' status who has nominated as a candidate will not be required to show his or her address on the nomination form. I think there are good reasons for doing that in many circumstances. The Electoral Commission will not need to advertise the receipt of an initial application for registration of a political party where the Commission initially determines that the application is defective and that the applicant refuses to vary the application. These and other housekeeping matters are straightforward but necessary. The Bill will eliminate the need to send a non-voter's notice to an elector who has already shown that he or she had a valid reason for failing to vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, three matters concerning legal proceedings are also proposed. Firstly, the service of court processes is to be allowable by mail delivery instead of by direct service, as required by some State and Territory legislation. Secondly, where a person has been named on electoral material, for example as the authoriser, then that fact can be used as prima facie evidence in proceedings against the named person for an offence against the Electoral Act. This provision is necessary because criminal prosecution is currently very difficult, if not impossible, in respect of false how-to-vote cards because of the rules of evidence which apply in court proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know of one instance where this provision would have been particularly useful. It might have been a telling factor in a case in which the Democrats were involved. In, I think it was, the 1987 election for the seat of Petrie, Queensland, a Liberal candidate, Mr Hodges, issued a bogus Democrat how-to-vote card, directly attempting to link that how-to-vote card with the direction of preferences to the Liberal candidate in Petrie. That matter has not been satisfactorily resolved as far as I am concerned. So I welcome this extra provision. </PARA>

I did not plan to speak but I wish to make some remarks in the light of the comments that were made by Senator Kernot. Senator Kernot drew our attention to her concern for the taxpayer. Her concern for the taxpayer relates to the fact that the Australian Democrats have a proposal that they put down in this Parliament that taxes be increased by over $7 billion in their alternative Budget. Some concern for the taxpayer! Senator Kernot was worried about the issue of tax deductibility and suggested a lack of concern on our part. I point out to her that the reason that clause was in this Bill was that it was actually the policy of the Australian Democrats. They had a policy that the first $100 of a contribution be tax deductible.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Truth in advertising was another matter Senator Kernot raised. I think all of us would strongly endorse the need for advertisements to be accurate and not misleading. I suggest that that applies not only to advertising but also to things like direct mail. Senator Kernot sent off a direct mail letter, if I recall correctly, to a large number of people in the agriculture machinery area in which she misleadingly quoted our policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So for her to stand up in this Parliament and lecture everybody else about the need to be truthful in advertising, I suggest, is worthy of comment. There is the old saying, `Physician, heal thyself', or, to paraphrase that, `Politician, heal thyself'. If Senator Kernot wishes to get up and talk about everybody else being truthful, she should make sure that her direct mail letters are entirely accurate. Then she will be slightly more credible on that front. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We still have the great dilemma, despite all the amendments which have been brought before us, that the trade union movement is in receipt of vast amounts of money from this Government and, at the same time, contributes to the Labor Party. Taxpayer funds go out to the trade union movement; the trade union movement contributes extensively to the Labor Party. The total amount of grants by this Labor Government to the trade union movement since Hawke came to office has been $15m and, in the last year, some $12m. It is a very big problem where we have a major interest group so closely allied with one political party in receipt of very substantial grants of taxpayer funds. </PARA>

It had continued to be supported by conservative governments, governments which at that time were prepared to cop criticism from this organisation. As a government, we have been criticised by this organisation probably as much as we have been thanked by it. Being a former Minister for Consumer Affairs, I was the butt of some of its criticisms. But that did not lead us on this side of the Parliament to stop its funding.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of points need to be responded to before we go to the committee stage. The first one is in respect of the candidate information booklet. I do not need to debate this at any great length other than to say that the booklet was proposed as a way of compensating for the absence of political advertising at the time the final Bill went through the Senate. Since the High Court decided to rewrite the rules of the game in this area and since political advertising has now been allowed to continue, the Government felt that there was no need to keep in place a mechanism to compensate for the absence of political advertising. As a consequence of that, we are rescinding that part of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer raised a question in which I am sure he delighted in raising: the question in respect to the provision that we are proposing which will make it illegal for people to persuade electors to use an optional preferential vote. The question is: are we not penalising people for advocating that people vote formally? I suppose that is what Senator Parer is asking. The response to that is that under the Act as it now stands we have in place what can best be termed a savings clause, which will ensure that those who have made a mistake on their ballot paper do not have their votes discarded because of an unintentional mistake. In those circumstances, we are talking about people who vote 1, 2, and then may vote for three candidates with a number 3 or for two candidates with a number 3 and next one with a number 5. That provision is basically there to ensure that people do not unintentionally vote informally in this circumstance. The legislation also ensures that we do not have an optional preferential system. Unlike some State legislatures, Federal Parliament has decided not to adopt that system. </PARA>

What we are doing by our amendment is ensuring that people do not go out and intentionally frustrate the will of this Parliament by advocating an optional preferential system. So, to an extent, what Senator Parer is saying may have some validity; but in the context of the legislation and the theory behind it&mdash;legislation which does not accept optional preferential voting&mdash;what we are saying by our amendment is that those who were out there campaigning in the 1987 and the 1990 elections to frustrate the will of the Parliament by advocating what is in essence an optional preferential vote, should not be allowed to continue to do that.

So it has public funding and, since we passed the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill in December last year, it also has tax deductibility on the membership of political parties and donations of up to $100.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kernot knows the reasons behind the arguments. She is trying to pretend otherwise. We are not stupid. If public funding is available, anyone who does not take it is out of his or her brain. It does not mean that, from a policy point of view, we are opposed to it. We pushed for tax deductibility because we believe that donations to political parties should be fair and equitable. Everyone, including Senator Bolkus and Senator Kernot, is aware of this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our concern was that there was a gross inequity because the major funding of the Australian Labor Party comes from the trade union movement. The ALP gets its money from affiliation fees to the trade union movement, which in turn gets it in the form of tax deductible donations. In addition, all income earned by the trade unions, irrespective of whether they run the casino on the Gold Coast or have properties in the CBDs of Sydney, Melbourne or Adelaide, is tax-free. That means that the ALP gets the benefit of affiliation fees coming from tax-free monies as well as any income that might be earned by the trade unions from tax-free monies. To make tax free the $100, which would enable those individuals to contribute to parties, including the Labor Party, reduces albeit in a minor way the inequity that already exists. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After hearing the remarks of Senator Parer, I have decided to speak. For a decade now, it has been a remarkable case of hypocrisy by the Liberal Party to argue on every occasion it gets that it is opposed to public funding. But when an election comes around it is first to go to the Electoral Commission to collect the cheques to pay for the election campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this was the moral issue that the Opposition claims it is&mdash;if public funding is so immoral&mdash;I would have thought it would have had the guts to announce that it was going to accept the money. But not on your nelly! Now we have the diversion of an attack on the trade union movement and the contributions to the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At one stage it was rumoured that the Liberal Party wanted to amend legislation to make it more difficult for trade unions to make a contribution to the Labor Party, either by affiliation fees or by donations. Under the arbitration Act all registered trade unions have to declare such donations in their annual financial reports. They have been publicly disclosed for decades. But the Liberal Party, which has lived on the donations from the business sector and from public companies, has never sought to vote to force companies to declare in their annual reports the donations that are made to political parties, including itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would find it less hypocritical and a little more substantial for Senator Parer and the Liberal Party to argue their case in attacking the trade union contributions if they were willing to argue that the Companies Act ought to be amended so that it is compulsory to disclose donations to political parties&mdash;as trade unions have to&mdash;in their annual reports. But not a whisper, not a word. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer suggested that there ought to be ballots of trade union members before a union can make a contribution to the Labor Party or affiliate with it. I have never seen anybody in the Liberal Party put up a proposal that there ought to be a ballot of all shareholders in a public company before a donation can be made. Senator Parer knows full well, as does the Liberal Party, that if such a proposal were to be put up, shareholders would overwhelmingly vote it down and they would not get any money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of this endless debate from the Liberal Party, there would be a much more substantial case if it moved amendments to the Companies Act to make it compulsory for directors to disclose donations made in the annual report and to call on all shareholders to vote at the annual meeting as to whether they agree that donations should be made to any political party. Until it does that, it is running an absolutely hypocritical case. It is part of its campaign to smear and attack the trade union movement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) made a very interesting comment about adjustments in the level of public funding being linked to a basket of methodologies. That interesting question has been considered by the ABS in respect of other areas. For example, there is a great concern amongst retirees that, for a number of reasons, the CPI adjustment is not an adequate arrangement so far as their circumstances are concerned. Mr Chairman, I would be out of order if I went into this matter any further. However, the Minister has raised a very interesting question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked the Minister why the Government had reversed its support for a leaflet briefly detailing the policies of a candidate going out to each elector. The reason the Minister has given is the High Court decision in respect of political broadcasting. Political advertising was not prevented by the political broadcasting legislation. In fact, it was provided for in the legislation which was overturned by the High Court. The two major parties were to get a certain amount of equal free time and the remainder was to be divided up between minor parties and Independents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court threw out that type of political advertising and left open the adoption of other types of political advertising, such as paid political advertising. We will now have paid political advertising. To be quite frank, it is just not logical for the Minister to say that, because of the High Court's decision, the Government is not going to support the distribution of a leaflet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern has been expressed by Senator Kernot. At the next election we will have a return to a presidential-style campaign between Paul Keating and John Hewson. The electorate will be bombarded by highly paid, slick political advertising from both sides, ultimately funded substantially by the taxpayer and much of it not going to the crucial issues which face the electorate in various areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Distributing a leaflet outlining policies in respect of various areas of concern has merit in that it would enable electors to sit down, study them and come to a conclusion. Many of them may not study it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My position, and the Government's, is that we think the justification for the booklet dissipated with the High Court decision and the reintroduction of radio and television political advertisements. Senator Harradine and the Democrats take a view that there is still a need for it. It is a matter of judgment. I do not think that by debating it we will come to a common position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of Senator Harradine's second point as to whether there was a submission, my advice is that there probably was not a substantial one and that we had the Commission address the mechanics of how to do it. Obviously, a lot of problems were raised in that context. There is no recollection of there being a substantial submission. If there were one, I would be very surprised if it was in support of the proposal. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The clause in the Bill I have before me concerns the direction given to conduct an indicative preference count on the night of the ballot. The Bill I have states in clause 22:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2A) Each Assistant Returning Officer must, if the Australian Electoral Officer for the State or Territory that includes the relevant Division so directs in writing, also:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)conduct a scrutiny of such preferences (other than first preferences), on such of the ballot-papers, as are required by the direction; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)transmit to the Divisional Returning Officer any information required by the direction; . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister, if that is as it still stands&mdash;and I have not seen the subsequent document being circulated&mdash;does the Australian electoral officer for each State or Territory have discretion to give or not to give a direction to the assistant returning officer in each polling booth about carrying out the indicative count of the preferences?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this matter because of the extraordinary circumstances in Kingston during the last election where all the pre-election polls showed the Democrats on about 30 per cent, the Labor Party on about 30 per cent and the Liberal Party on about 30 per cent. It was going to be split very close either way and clearly the result could have gone any way between the three candidates. I rang the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for Australia to ask whether he would give an indication to the returning officers in each polling booth that on the night, at the request of the scrutineers, they should count the two-party preferred vote, so that we would get a much clearer idea of the result from all the booths at the close of counting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a 40-minute conversation with the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for Australia, I came to the conclusion that he did not have a clue what I was talking about&mdash;this idea of counting preferences to get the two-party preferred vote&mdash;because he started quoting all sorts of sections of the Act saying that this could not be done and so on. I pointed out to him that informally it had been going on in polling booths for at least the last 20 or 30 years. I came to the conclusion that either he did not understand the Act or he was thick, or both. In the end, I was told that the Act was very complicated and that my informal request could not be acceded to. I understand that other members of parliament made similar requests for other electorates and they were all turned down. This led to the recommendation coming from the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters with which we are now dealing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read in the Bill that, if the Australian electoral officer for each State or Territory decides not to direct, an indicative preference count cannot take place. By putting in an application to the Australian electoral officer for each State or Territory, does that automatically mean that the direction is given?  We could still run into the situation where the electoral officer for each State may refuse a request from a member of the public or a political party that the preferences on a two-party preferred basis are not counted by the end of the night in each polling booth. So the intent of what we are all after could still be thwarted by a recalcitrant Commonwealth electoral officer in each State not following the request. I wonder whether the Minister could respond to that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Schacht raises questions which are in fact covered by the amendments to the amendments. There is a provision under the fourth amendment of the amendments moved on behalf of the Government which ensures that during a scrutiny:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the scrutineers must be allowed to inspect, in addition to the preference votes being counted in the scrutiny, any other preference vote given for a candidate unless, in the opinion of the Assistant Returning Officer or DRO, as the case may be, this may unreasonably delay the scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA>The words `unreasonably delay' are there to ensure that the delay is not excessive. Where representatives of candidates are there as scrutineers and want to inspect the votes, they will be given the opportunity to do so as long as it does not mean that by giving the extra time to the scrutineers it will take all night long to count the vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that goes directly to Senator Schacht's question is the fifth amendment. One does not need to apply to get this count through. The amendment reads:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I could ask one further technical question now that I have the further amendments which cover practically all my points of concern, amendment No. 5 states at the end, `will provide an indication of which candidate is most likely to be elected for the Division'. When dealing with situations such as that which occurred at the last election in the electorate of Kingston or in Queensland electorates where the Liberal-National Party and the Labor Party are both getting, say, 30 per cent of the vote each and it is very hard to tell which party will finally emerge as the two-party preferred winning candidate, does this mean that the electoral officer will also count a two-party preferred vote of Labor versus Liberal or Labor versus National Party or National Party versus Liberal Party? Does the amendment cover that possibility? Even though it will take longer to do, will the two-party preferred be counted the right way so that one knows on the night who will ultimately be the two final candidates and not just counted out thinking that it will be Labor versus Liberal when in fact it is a Liberal versus National Party result?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason why I went to both provisions when I initially answered Senator Schacht's question was that, in that context, the capacity and the opportunity for the scrutineers to count and to inspect the second preference votes of other candidates is important. For instance, if we take the seat of Kennedy, where there is a massive number of outlying polling booths, Kennedy would be treated in the same way as other seats. On the night, the Electoral Commissioner, or his delegate, will decide which are the two candidates that he thinks will survive through the count. The returning officers will be asked to transmit the votes for those candidates through to the central tally room for that electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, for instance, during the course of the ballot on that evening they find that they have the Liberal instead of the National candidate as one of the two to whom preferences are to be distributed, then it may be very difficult to get a complete recount on that evening. But, in order to ensure that there is some certainty available at an early time during the count, we have put in place that amendment that I previously mentioned to give scrutineers the opportunity to go through and look at where the preference votes are going so that there can be some degree of certainty by the end of the night as to who might win the seat. The honourable senator does raise a problem which we anticipate we can overcome, but there may be circumstances in which it might be just too difficult. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have one amendment but I also have a couple of questions so I would like to ask those first. The first one relates to clause 22A, which deals with precluding an optional preferential vote. It is still possible to get around this, is it not, because this only applies during an election period? It is the same argument as for the advertising. For the rest of the year, somebody could write a book, run courses, do whatever they like. I think that loophole exists.</PARA></TALK.START>

I understand the Government has some problems with this amendment, but it is important to get on the record the view that this Government should take steps to rectify the situation that Mr Phil Cleary and other candidates who work in the Public Service find themselves faced with every time they contemplate standing for an election. We need the best people standing for election in this country and we do not need discriminatory legislation which means that public servants rule themselves out of candidacy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does raise a question as to whether one should, for instance, work in private enterprise. I felt that it was best for me not to do that given that I had been elected as a Labor candidate and people knew where I had come from and where I had been working. But Senator Crichton-Browne is right; I could have worked there. I could even have taken the dole, but that may have caused all sorts of other problems under the Constitution. So I understand the problems. I do not, however, appreciate the press statement Senator Kernot put out saying that Cleary should not happen again. I do not know what the Democrats have against Phil Cleary that they insist that he should not happen again! Unlike Peter Reith, I do not take the same attitude to Phil Cleary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to Senator Kernot's amendment, sympathetic though the Government might be to the principle that the Democrats are pursuing, that principle being that public servants should not be unfairly discriminated against in being able to stand for parliament, the Democrats are attempting to introduce provisions that apply in Federal legislation in respect of State and Territory parliaments and candidates for State and Territory elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advice I have is that it would be beyond the Commonwealth's constitutional power to apply through this legislation provisions to govern State legislatures and candidates for State legislatures. Sympathetic as I am to the principle, we have had enough instances of playing Russian roulette with the High Court in respect of electoral legislation in recent days. I suggest that, instead of Senator Kernot pursuing the Democrats' amendment this afternoon in this process, she allow me to have the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) raise this matter for discussion between State and Federal Attorneys with a view to uniformity in approach in respect of all legislatures, State and Territory and, of course, the Commonwealth, which has its in place already. I think the best way to go would be for the States to make amendments to go as far as we have in respect of their parliaments and the election processes of their parliaments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the comments that have been made, but the Constitution is quite clear. I myself was in a situation in 1975 when I had to decide whether or not to resign from certain boards. For example, the wages boards at that time had an honorarium, although a very minor one. So I resigned from those. I did not resign from the Library Board because I did not think that was an office of profit under the Crown. The Government of the day looked at various options when I was elected as Secretary of the TTLC 10 years before that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Secretary of the TTLC was always appointed to a paying board, normally the Hydro Electric Commission. The position of Secretary of the TTLC was a very poorly paid job. But I had had a barney with the Government of the day and it looked around for the only non-paying board to which to appoint me, and that was the Library Board. There was no remuneration involved&mdash;although I suppose it was an office of profit under the Crown in that we had a convivial drink after each monthly board meeting! But, there again, that was a problem. A year after I resigned finally some questions were raised in the Parliament about 24 dozen bottles of beer being consumed by the Library Board. I knew that I was the only member of the Library Board who actually drank beer, and I knew that I had not disposed of 24 dozen bottles of beer in a period of 12 months over 12 sittings&mdash;only half a dozen or whatever. The whereabouts of those bottles I think remains a mystery. Nevertheless, the point is that I chose not to resign from that board before standing for election because I considered it not an office of profit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bills that we are now debating cognately are the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill and the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill. I will say a little about both of those. The States Grants (General Purposes) Bill is a standard Bill to allow for the payment of $14.1 billion in grants to the States and the Northern Territory for general current and capital purposes. The amounts of the grants were agreed to at the Premiers Conference held on 12 June this year. At that Premiers Conference, global borrowing limits were also agreed to. However, in the light of recent Australian Loan Council developments, particularly in Victoria, one must wonder how strictly they will be followed. That is a matter that we will be looking at very carefully in the Senate Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council, which is in the process of commencing its deliberations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The States Grants (General Purposes) Bill is the major instrument of financial relationships between the Commonwealth, on the one hand, and the States and the Northern Territory, on the other hand. The value of the financial assistance grants is the same in real terms for 1992-93 as it was for 1991-92. There is also a one-off augmentation of $166m for this year only. Identified but untied road grants and capital purposes grants are also maintained in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Labor Government's idea of Commonwealth-State relations has been characterised by the quite unrepentant desire of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for a greater centralisation of power in Canberra at the expense of the States and Territories. It should not come as any surprise to the Australian community that that is the case with Prime Minister Keating. Quite consistently throughout his term as Treasurer he constantly attacked the States and made good Commonwealth Government savings at the expense of the States. One of the remarkable features of financial management and fiscal policy during the 1980s was the extent to which the Commonwealth Government allowed its own purpose spending to continue to mushroom year by year whilst, at the same time, squeezing the lemon very dry so far as Commonwealth payments to the States were concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This attack on State government finances led the States to use excess borrowings. During the 1980s it forced them to increase narrowly-based and unproductive taxes, such as payroll tax and stamp duties. That is one of the reasons we have the unemployment problem that we have today. Payroll tax&mdash;one of the taxes that a Hewson-coalition government will abolish on coming to office&mdash;has increased very savagely over the course of the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Payroll tax is simply a tax on jobs. It is the last thing that Australia needs at the moment with one million Australians unemployed. Today's national account figures show that growth in the economy is limping along or wallowing. We are nowhere near achieving anything but a rate of growth which will see unemployment inexorably increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many years ago the Prime Minister himself said, as the then Treasurer, that the abolition of payroll tax would cause the creation of another 180,000 to 200,000 jobs in Australia. We agree and that is one of the essential reasons why we will be abolishing payroll tax. It is extraordinary to me that the Government has not deemed fit to act in a like manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reform of Commonwealth-State financial relations is long overdue. The former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, made a not insignificant start to a cooperative federalist approach during his latter years as Prime Minister, only to have it torpedoed by Paul Keating's leadership aspirations at about this time last year. Indeed, Mr Keating's speech on Commonwealth-State relations, in which he reiterated his centralist views in this area, was one of the final catalysts that a year or so ago led to the overthrow of Prime Minister Hawke by Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback&mdash;the coalition's package of policies and proposals for reforms to rebuild Australia, and to restore growth and job creation in Australia&mdash;includes major reforms in the area of Commonwealth-State relations. With greater certainty and flexibility in respect of taxation&mdash;the removal, as I said, of the job destroying payroll tax&mdash;the States' financial integrity and corresponding accountability will be very much improved. Indeed, we regard the building of a better Commonwealth-State financial relationship as one of the most fundamental reforms to be achieved in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the coalition wish to build a better federation. We are totally committed to the Federal Constitution which, of course, is the cornerstone of our Federation. We support the Federal system which distributes powers in such a way as to encourage participation and which acts as a barrier against centralist, remote and authoritarian control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is now broad agreement throughout many sections of the Australian community&mdash;including the political parties, with the notable exception of the Prime Minister&mdash;that Commonwealth-State relations are in urgent need of reform. There is also widespread agreement about the problems that need to be resolved&mdash;duplication, lack of responsibility and apparent lack of coordination between different levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On coming to office, a Hewson-coalition government will negotiate with the States on the basis of giving them a permanent share of income tax. The coalition would be prepared to make room for the States to share directly in income tax revenue. In doing so, the existing rights of the less prosperous States would be fully protected; no State would be disadvantaged; and the relative positions of the States would be preserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We regard a greater sharing of revenue raising responsibilities than now exists between the Commonwealth and the States to be a very important reform for the 1990s. It will increase the financial integrity, accountability and responsibility of all levels of government, improve efficiency no end and lead to a higher level and quality of administration at all levels of government. It will also mean getting away from the duplications and overlaps and the resulting inefficiencies that arise from the present situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting the omission of a special clause in the current States Grants (General Purposes) Bill. In the corresponding Bill which was brought in in 1988&mdash;and this States Grants (General Purposes) Bill is an annual Bill to make provision each year for the payments to the States&mdash;a clause was inserted by the then Hawke Labor Government which sought to force the Queensland National Party Government of those days not only to conform but also to comply with Loan Council agreed borrowing limits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year, in 1992, we have seen the remarkable revelations that the former Victorian Labor Government, the Kirner Government&mdash;which so staunchly supported Paul Keating's leadership challenge last year&mdash;massively breached its borrowing guideline limits and deliberately hid that fact from the Victorian electorate, from other States and from lenders. That was a cover-up that appears, quite without doubt, to have been aided and abetted by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could not allow passage of the current Bill without noting the absence of a similar clause to that inserted in the corresponding Bill in 1988. The omission this year of a similar clause in this Bill shows the quite base political partisanship with which the Labor Government has dealt with its Labor mates around the Federation when it comes to this area of Commonwealth-State relations. Furthermore, it shows the lengths to which this Government will go to deceive in the interests of short term electoral gain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second Bill that we are debating is the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. This Bill legislates for a number of changes announced in the One Nation statement to liberalise foreign bank entry. The two changes allow more foreign banks to set up&mdash;in other words, the current limit will be removed&mdash;where those foreign banks meet certain prudential requirements. The Bill also allows for foreign branch banking in Australia. Foreign banks will no longer be required to incorporate in Australia. This provision will apply to wholesale banking only; it will not apply to retail banking. Another amendment contained in the Bill will complement New South Wales legislation to bring the State Bank of New South Wales under the Commonwealth Banking Act and also under the supervision of the Reserve Bank of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we are on the Reserve Bank and its supervisory role, I think it is worth mentioning here the role that the Reserve Bank played in the collapse of the State Bank of South Australia. As the Jacobs royal commission has said, the Reserve Bank neglected its supervisory role and, even though it may not have had a formal responsibility to supervise the State Bank of South Australia, it was undertaking informal supervision and should have exercised this responsibility better. The South Australian royal commission has followed the Tricontinental royal commission in my own State of Victoria which also was critical of the Reserve Bank's supervisory role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given this history of apparently lax supervision, one must wonder just what is happening in terms of the Reserve Bank and this supervisory role that it is supposed and required to have. As I said, the Reserve Bank was criticised in the report of the royal commission on the State Bank of South Australia. The Commissioner, Mr Jacobs QC, said that the Reserve Bank's policy of remaining aloof from banks' shareholders was `neither logical nor commercially and financially sensible when the shareholder was a State government'. Other things were also said in that royal commission report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the matters that concerns the coalition in respect of this is that neither the Reserve Bank nor the Government has made any reply to the criticisms of the bank contained in that royal commission report. In our view, there should be a full statement from the bank. It should not be from just any old anonymous spokesman from the bank; it should be from either the governor or the board of the bank&mdash;but preferably, of course, from the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). That is the source from which a full response to the criticisms should come and it should be made public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our view, Treasurer Dawkins should make a full ministerial statement to the Parliament outlining the response of the Reserve Bank to the criticisms of it made by the Jacobs royal commission. The Treasurer ducked the opportunity to do that in the last sitting weeks of the House of Representatives. The House comes back for a couple of days at the end of these Senate sittings on 16 and 17 December and we hope that the Government will make a full response to those criticisms at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final amendment contained in the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill is to establish a second deputy governor of the Reserve Bank. That position will have responsibility for prudential supervision. We welcome that, but I note in that welcoming that it is very much a matter of closing the gate after the horse has bolted&mdash;certainly so far as Victoria and South Australia are concerned. One hopes, though, that it will strengthen the supervisory role of the bank because it is obviously something that does need strengthening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are one or two other minor amendments included in the legislation&mdash;removing the requirement for the Commonwealth Bank to obtain approval to pay dividends from a shareholder general meeting; changing the basis for dealing with unclaimed moneys; and the revocation of the banking authority of the Australian Resources Development Bank. They are all amendments with which the coalition agrees. We will not be opposing these Bills but, in expressing our support for the Bills, I did want to make those points. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Banking Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 is a continuation of the internationalisation of the Australian economy and a further deregulation of the financial system. Currently, some foreign banks are allowed to trade in Australia under the Banking Act. The right to trade is governed by a banking authority, which is granted by the Treasurer on the advice of the Reserve Bank. In 1984, 16 foreign banks were invited to apply for authorities under the Banking Act. Fifteen applied and were successful. At the time, the Government said that it would not be issuing any more, and it has not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then came One Nation. Out of the blue, it seems, it was necessary to recommence the deregulation process. The banks probably could not believe their luck. Whilst Mr Keating was busy establishing what a real Labor man he was, he announced offshore banking changes, which we dealt with last night; amendments to the bad debt provisions in the income tax law to allow debts to be partially written off without forcing the banks to foreclose and bankrupt their clients; the relaxation of the requirements for the entry of more foreign banks into Australia; and the abolition of the requirement that foreign banks operate as separate entities, allowing foreign banks to operate in Australia as a branch. This Bill tonight deals with the two latter matters and a host of other minor banking matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The theory behind letting foreign banks compete in Australia is simple: it is said that these institutions will build market share by offering better and cheaper services to businesses and individuals. This will force the existing institutions to provide better and cheaper services, and everybody will be better off. There is a big question mark over whether this theory translates into practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, because of continual pressure exerted by former Senator Paul McLean and various community groups and the scandal of the Westpac letters, Mr Keating referred the whole question of banking deregulation and banking in general to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. This Committee was chaired by Mr Stephen Martin, a well-known friend of the then Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really do not think that one could realistically have expected this Committee to do anything other than support the previous track record of the former Treasurer and, in doing so, propose more deregulation and make a few tame recommendations in the area of consumer protection, which would then be shelved or emasculated by the Government. I believe that this is exactly what the Martin Committee did. The Martin banking inquiry concluded that the benefits of deregulation tended to be concentrated in the area of big business. How amazing! It completely ignored the devastating effect of using interest rates instead of credit growth as the only instrument of monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Martin Committee recommended that further foreign banks be allowed into Australia. However, it did not do what the Government wanted. The Committee put a caveat on its support for the further access of foreign banks, which was that an authority could be granted only where reciprocal access was offered by the countries of residence of the foreign banks concerned. That means that Australia should say that we want fair and equal access for our businesses before we allow foreign businesses access to our market. One would have to ask why Australian banks should not be granted reciprocal access rights. The Government rejected that condition. Australia is to simply roll over and give away part of its market. It looks suspiciously like the Government's stance on tariff policy to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is trying to show that Australia is an independent and self-reliant country. We do not tug the forelock to anybody any more&mdash;that is, we do not do so to anyone apart from the international financial community. It may be that the Labor Party saw what happened when Rex Connor tried to bypass the United States and British financiers. The Labor Party may have determined that the risk was too great, but that seems a bit unlikely to me. However, time will tell. Undoubtedly historians will look back on this period and notice the terrifying correlation between successive acts of financial deregulation and our fast immersion into the quicksand of enormous foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition believes that it correctly identifies some of Australia's problems, but the Prime Minister is dead right when he points out that Fightback would make things worse. He is probably the most effective political communicator in this generation and I think he will be able to hammer home the defects of the Opposition's financial policies. The Opposition has gone too far in embracing financial deregulation and market forces. This legislation in some respects could be seen as a further example of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the further question of foreign banks operating as branches in Australia, the Martin Committee also recommended that this be allowed, but that reciprocity be a condition. Again, the Government has not provided for that. But in its response to the Martin Committee report, the Government refused to even discuss reciprocity and officially responded `Qualified implementation'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think some members of the Labor Party would be a bit uncomfortable about the way in which the Government is seen in some ways to kowtow to the financial community without demanding some reasonable consumer offsets. Why not pursue a balance of reforms which also stop regressive bank fees being imposed? Why not ensure that adequate development capital is provided to small business? For example, in the superannuation area, why not ensure that consumers cannot be ripped off by excessive fees and charges?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That kind of approach is an inclusive approach which the Prime Minister referred to. He said something like, `Don't just grovel to the big end of town&mdash;recognise that markets do need to be regulated to protect people'. On principle, the Democrats will be voting against those two measures in the Committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matters are not controversial and we will not be opposing them. The States Grants (General Purposes) Bill is also being debated cognately with this Banking Legislation Amendment Bill. This is an annual Bill which appropriates moneys to be given to the States and Territories. This amounts to a bit over $14 billion this financial year. These are colloquially known as `untied' grants&mdash;that is, they are unfettered gifts of revenue for whatever purposes the recipients desire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for grants to be paid arises from the division of powers between the Commonwealth and the States. The reality is that no State ever wants to raise taxes to cover its expenditure, and it can only be done by all States jointly. Hence, the Commonwealth has great potential power over the States because it controls how much money they get. If the Commonwealth Parliament really wanted to be bloody-minded, this Bill could be used to achieve a huge number of initiatives at the State level. For example, if it were unconstitutional for the Commonwealth to amend the electoral legislation&mdash;as we discussed during the previous debate&mdash;to give State public servants reinstatement rights after resigning to contest an election, an amendment to this Bill could make a State change its laws or else be ineligible to receive the grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a huge power, but I understand why it is not used very often. It is a reserve power of the Commonwealth. One has to concede that it could be used to effect important matters at any time. One recent example is the treatment of Queensland when it refused to agree to the global limits proposed by Canberra. The Democrats will be supporting these Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bills before us are not controversial in their main thrust, and in a moment I will deal with some of the concerns raised by Senator Kernot. The States Grants (General Purposes) Bill&mdash;and this is the third year in a row in which I have dealt with this Bill&mdash;never gets a significant amount of attention in this chamber, essentially because it is a fairly routine implementation of publicly known government decisions; it is part of the Budget and within the Bill there are no controversial clauses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is sometimes worth while stopping to remember that this is a Bill under which we are proposing to provide $14 billion to the States and the Northern Territory&mdash;about 13 per cent of the estimated Commonwealth Budget outlays in 1992-93. That does not make the Bill controversial, nor does it mean that we have to make long speeches about it, but from time to time it does seem a little surprising that $14 billion flicks through unnoticed while we agonise over matters of trivia and take hours, days and sometimes even weeks to pursue matters of much lesser consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose it is sensible, if we all agree about a proposal, that we should not spend too much time dwelling on it. However, a number of very important decisions are reflected in this legislation. To the extent that there is any controversy within the chamber about the package of Bills we are discussing, it does not relate to the State Grants (General Purpose) Bill but to the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just recapitulate what this Bill does and deal with the elements about which Senator Kernot raised some concern. First, the Bill liberalises foreign bank entry and permits the issue of banking authorities to foreign owned banks; secondly, it permits foreign banks which are authorised under the Banking Act to operate as wholesale banks in the form of a branch; thirdly, it amends the Banking Act to make it clear that depositors with foreign bank branches are not subject to the depositor protection provisions of the Banking Act; and fourthly, and quite importantly, it amends the Banking Act 1959 to complement New South Wales legislation which will enable the State Bank of New South Wales to apply for a banking authority under the Banking Act. I think that is a positive step in bringing the State Banks which are constitutionally separate from the Reserve Bank's standard proceedings in and under the Banking Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, the Bill amends the Banking Act to make several minor amendments with respect to unclaimed moneys in bank accounts and to revoke the banking authority of the Australian Resources Development Bank. Sixthly, it streamlines the process of declaring dividends by enabling the board of the Commonwealth Bank to declare dividends without seeking shareholder approval at a general meeting. Finally, the Bill provides for the creation of a second Deputy Governor position in the Reserve Bank. That is also important. Because the whole chamber supports this point it may go unnoticed, but it will assist the Reserve Bank's prudential supervision of the banking system and is consistent with the recommendation of the inquiry into banking by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration&mdash;the Martin Committee. The second Deputy Governor will also participate in the management of the Reserve Bank and will be a member of the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me logically to the inquiry into banking by the Martin Committee. I thought that Senator Kernot was a bit unfair to the Martin Committee because Steve Martin, in his capacity as Chairman of that Committee, and the subsequent Chairman, Paul Elliott, have both done an enormous amount to demystify banking in this country and to make it easier for people to come to grips with the issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Banking and finance is one of those areas that tends to generate conspiracy theories where everybody thinks that somehow or other in the bowels of some banks someone is doing something mystical and creating credit and then suddenly this ogre will emerge to devour the poor innocent citizens. I think we have now put most analysis of that on a more rational basis. What the Martin Committee recognised, what the Government recognises and what the Bill reflects is that we are now in an international financial community. We cannot escape that fact. There is no separate existence for a modern Western economy other than as a participant of the international banking system. So we should get out there and compete effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We talk about possible concern with international banks coming into Australia, but Australian banks are very active participants in the international banking community. In Europe, in Asia, in Africa, in New Zealand, and particularly in the UK, we have various major Australian banks participating very effectively and on a large scale. I do not think we want to try to retreat behind some barriers where we think we might be protected from the international financial community. The transfer of money is instantaneous these days and we all need to be a little more up to date and recognise that those are the terms under which we all operate. Therefore, that is the context in which these amendments are being brought forward. In conclusion, I simply note that there will be some government amendments at the committee stage. I thank senators for their support. </PARA>

One of the requirements is that the annual statement of all sums of unclaimed moneys of not less than $100 contain information by which accounts may be identified, including the name and address, so far as they are known to the bank, of the deceased person's legal representative. Since banks are responsible for verifying the bona fides of claimants, we only need sufficient information to ascertain whether the moneys in question have been transferred to the Commonwealth.

<PARA>I do not think this needs much debate; the issues for and against are well-known. We have on each recent night moved at some appropriate stage to suspend standing order 64. We have not needed it on each occasion, but we have done it as a contingency and the way the program is progressing, I think we will need to continue to do that on a regular basis. It seems to me that the most intelligent and systematic programming mechanism is to do away with standing order 64 and continue to seek a cooperative approach to the passage of the legislative program.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We oppose the motion moved by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator McMullan). I sat patiently awaiting the reasons to justify the Government's case for suspending standing order 64, not for tonight but for the balance of the session, and Senator McMullan did not even seek to make out such a case. Basically, he said&mdash;I appreciate his giving us some credit for cooperation&mdash;that on occasions it might need to be suspended. If it needs to be suspended on occasions, why should it not be addressed on those occasions? I remind the Senate that standing order 64 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No new business shall be commenced after the question for the adjournment of the Senate has been first put on any sitting day.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a sensible standing order which acts as a persuasion to the Government to keep its program in order and in some ways reminds us that it is not good practice to introduce new legislation late at night. The result is that if the legislation is to be dealt with in such circumstances, it does not receive the proper scrutiny to which it is entitled. Therefore, the standing order seems to me to be sound in all circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only question is whether something of an exceptional nature is occurring now that would require, in the interests of proper management, that standing orders be suspended for the balance of the session. There is no such occurrence. There is no doubt that the Government's program this session has been a shambles. The Government has presented to us a ridiculously large volume of legislation at the end of the session. It has therefore imposed unreasonable pressure upon the Senate to do its job in a sound and satisfactory way. But we have criticised the Government for that and that is now a fact of life. It is a regret that it is not able to get a program that gets the legislation before the Senate earlier in the session so that it can be dealt with in an orderly way with the degree of scrutiny that we think is appropriate. Be that as it may, that is irrelevant to what is now being debated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, Senator McMullan has not made any case for suspending this standing order for the balance of the session. I presume that the Australian Democrats also think that it is unwise and unnecessary and that they also recognise that to set aside a standing order that limits a Minister from introducing new legislation late at night is not sensible practice. But this will again put them to the test. Basically, this session the Australian Democrats have not behaved well in this regard. When they promised not to introduce a guillotine in the Appropriation Bills, they immediately introduced a guillotine which restricted our capacity to scrutinise. It will be interesting to see whether they go along with this concept of the Government that the work of the Senate can properly be done in the wee hours of the night. We know that was their view the other night because they conspired with the Government to see that the Senate sat all night, which was a ridiculous practice and resulted in the Senate not doing its job properly, apart from adding unnecessary stress in what is already a stressful job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the Australian Democrats will say to the Government, `You have not made out your case for this suspension. You should come back each day, and if you are not achieving sufficient business and you can make out special circumstances the Senate can address the need for suspending the standing order on the particular day in question'. It will be interesting to hear the Australian Democrats' view on that. Simply because the Government has adopted bad practice does not justify the suspension of this standing order&mdash;this sensible protection&mdash;for the balance of this session, and that is why the coalition will oppose it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the interests of curtailing filibustering and encouraging collective discipline, I point out that some members of the Opposition today have addressed no comments at all to the provisions of the Bills we have been debating. I think that is an absolute abuse of this chamber. Members of the Opposition should not talk to us about cooperating or having lots of time. We should all be asking: are we being fair in the way we are using the time allocated to us in this chamber? We are not being fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the request to suspend this standing order is a reasonable one. It aids cooperation. I repeat: it does not compel us to sit here until midnight. It makes it possible for us to do so should that be necessary. If members of the Opposition want to complain, all we have to see is the evidence&mdash;no filibustering, and some sort of collective discipline so that the time available is used fairly. </PARA>

Whether or not the adjournment is negatived at 10.30 is another question. We are talking about the suspension of a standing order. Negativing the adjournment is a different question, although I am opposed to it. But that is a motion that is before the Chair pursuant to Standing Orders.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This procedure is a suspension of Standing Orders. As Senator Hill said, there have to be exceptional circumstances to suspend Standing Orders.

As it affects the environment, very important conservation issues are involved.

Basically, we have an even more substantive reason for being appalled at the way the Government has gone about this legislation. The Minister in charge of the Bill, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly), has completely bypassed the very expensive and very extensive ecologically sustainable development process in bringing this Bill forward at this time.

Out of left field, so to speak, this Minister produced an initial draft of a Bill a few weeks ago which had nothing to do with the ESD process. This draft Bill was not a matter of consultation; it was produced at a time when the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council, ANZECC, had already appointed a task force to look at the problems of the protection of endangered species. That task force was still drawing up a draft national strategy within which the governments that are party to that Council were to draw their respective pieces of legislation, when this legislation was rushed through the House of Representatives in one hour. </PARA>

We heard today an impassioned plea from the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Coulter) when he said that the Senate was being robbed of Question Time when in fact six minutes of Question Time were being removed by an urgency motion. I wonder now whether this newfound enthusiasm for the democratic process from a party that has in the past supported the guillotine will be shown in its attitude to its 81 amendments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have here is a mosaic of legislation which would be effective in protecting endangered species. That is, we were to have a mosaic of legislation which would be effective in protecting endangered species. That mosaic was to be drawn up, according to a nationally agreed plan, after full consultation with the States. That should not have been a long, drawn-out process. That task force was to report in March with its final recommendations. It should have been possible in the first half of next year to have legislation before this chamber and complementary legislation through the State parliaments dealing with this issue in a sensible way. But what did we get?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present Minister for the Environment acted totally politically again, presumably under instructions from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), whose every act in this lead-up to the election is a political one. She went right around the side of this issue and absolutely broke agreements with the States and ignored the commitments that she had made to the other Ministers to wait for the report of this task force on endangered species. She came up with legislation which even her own ministerial colleagues found totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was supposed consultation with the States on the draft Bill, but the draft was sent out to the States so that they got it about a day before the proposed consultation. When this consultation with the States was held, three States could not be present, simply because they had not had sufficient notice. Yet the Minister said that people had been consulted. The conservation groups and industry representatives were allegedly consulted on the same notice. To call that a process of satisfactory consultation is a denial of the normal meaning of the phrase. </PARA>

He added that, fortunately, other Ministers in the Government listened to some of the advice that was coming in from a broader range of people than apparently the Minister for the Environment was prepared to listen to, and substantial changes were made to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From what we have seen of it so far, we are in favour of the general thrust of the legislation. Let there be no mistake about this&mdash;and I want to stress it&mdash;the coalition is very concerned that there should be satisfactory legislation around the whole of Australia to protect endangered species. There can be no doubt about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must admit that I am not looking forward to hearing&mdash;but no doubt I will&mdash;the usual misrepresentation about these matters that comes from the Government, and I expect from the Australian Democrats, when they say that the coalition is in some way not interested or concerned about these matters. We are concerned about these matters but we are also concerned that the legislation should be the result of due process and proper consultation; that it should be conducted within the framework of ESD and the ministerial council; that it should be in accordance with the intergovernmental agreement on the environment; and that it should be the right legislation to do the job properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intergovernmental agreement has been breached by the Federal Minister in this case because the State Ministers did not have a satisfactory opportunity to give their views under the agreement.

I note that in the House of Representatives Mr Carlton said that our support for the legislation at that stage was conditional upon the various submissions to be made to the Opposition from conservation groups, unions, industry and anybody who has an interest in the matter. They have been sought, and it is as a result of some of those that I intend to move some amendments in the committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose there is clear merit in referring this matter to a committee. To an extent, we want to see what all these Democrat amendments really mean.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry, the unions and the conservation groups have put a lot of work, time and resources into the ESD process at great expense. For all that work to be just bypassed, strikes me as an extraordinary way to run this country, but in view of the way that the Government seems to be running the economy, I am not surprised that it certainly cannot run its conservation policy very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intergovernmental agreement on the environment itself is a breach of the undertakings by the Labor Government to the conservation movement, as the conservation movement did not want intergovernmental agreements with the States. The conservation movement wanted overriding Commonwealth legislation in most cases, which the Labor Party promised  before the last election but did not and could not deliver. We cannot ignore the States which have entered into discussions with ANZECC and also entered into intergovernmental agreements, and they are upset that the agreement has been bypassed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So just about everybody has been offended by this Minister. She can do it without really trying, but in this case it looks as though she has tried pretty hard. Many of us are thankful for the efforts of the Minister's colleagues in amending the Bill. If the present Bill were similar to its first draft, I certainly would not be making the supportive remarks that I am today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want any further misrepresentation by the Government of our intentions on conservation issues. I am able to offer the coalition's support simply because of the intervention of some sensible Ministers on the Government's side. I am not one of those people who say that everything the Government, Ministers or even Parliamentary Secretaries do is necessarily wrong. Sometimes it is misguided, but it is not necessarily wrong. We are concerned that we should have a proper consideration of these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides lists of endangered species. We would want to look at the definition of an endangered species. We need technical advice to see whether the definitions that are offered are acceptable to us. The list provided for in the Bill includes endangered, vulnerable and presumed extinct native species, along with lists of endangered ecological communities and key threatening processes. It sets up advisory committees. An endangered species advisory committee is to be established to advise the Minister of his or her obligations under the Act, as is an endangered species scientific subcommittee to advise the Minister on the lists that are referred to in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are proposals for recovery and threat abatement plans not only on the part of the Commonwealth itself; there are also cooperative plans with the States. We are pleased to see that the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service is a responsible person named in the Act as the director in charge of this piece of legislation. We certainly have confidence that the ANPWS would act sensibly in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very important area of the legislation is that of the placing of conservation orders, of which there are three kinds: interim, permanent or impact assessment. We note that the previously unfettered right of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories to take various decisions unaided by colleagues has been watered down. We say amen to all that. Obviously that was by the intervention of other Ministers, who recognised the risks of leaving her with that kind of power. There are restrictions on what the Minister can do in putting an interim conservation order on a particular activity in order to protect a species that might be threatened, pending suitable investigation. That seems quite sensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there are permanent conservation orders which can be made on Commonwealth lands and waters by the environment Minister on the same grounds as the interim conservation orders. Although the Minister says in her second reading speech that these will be made only with the approval of Cabinet, as will extensions of interim conservation orders, the legislation does not prescribe this. We have only the support of the second reading speech for requirement for the Minister to consult with the Cabinet and get Cabinet agreement on a permanent conservation order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not as strong a basis as we would like. It is a much weaker form of restraint on the Minister. It relies on the Acts Interpretation Act and a court presumably looking at the second reading speech and giving that a certain weight. It certainly does not have the same weight as a section of the Act which would require the Minister to take a matter to Cabinet and go through the Executive Council. That is one of the matters we will be raising later on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem is that the Bill relies very much on the key concept of ecologically sustainable development. That is not described in the Bill itself; it is to be dealt with by regulation. The procedure of allowing this key concept to be dealt with by regulation contravenes the convention that important questions of policy and principle be dealt with in an Act and not in regulations under it. That is one of the matters of major concern to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My time is running out. I simply state that the coalition is a supporter of the protection of endangered species, but surely there are better ways of doing so than the Government has shown in its presentation of this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the Opposition. That captured Green preferences and thereby secured the ALP victories at the polls. One of those promises was to use increased powers to protect native flora and fauna from extinction. That specifically means using the corporations power; that is what the Government referred to quite clearly when it mentioned increased powers. This Bill fails to live up to that promise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of the corporations power, which is what is meant by `increased powers', was not even seriously considered in the preparation of this Bill. The Bill itself applies only to Commonwealth land and waters and Commonwealth agencies. Commonwealth land represents a mere 0.2 per cent of this vast continent of ours. It is ludicrous to establish a framework for species conservation within Commonwealth jurisdiction only. It makes no ecological sense. Therefore, the arbitrary nature of this Bill makes it fundamentally flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the corporations power, I cannot help noting in passing that, while both the Government and the Opposition have specifically said that they would use the corporations power to enter the area of industrial relations, both have steadfastly refused to protect endangered species using precisely that same head of power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though this Bill has been described by conservation groups as the barest minimum, certain business and industry groups have been vociferous, if not stridently implacable, in their opposition to it. These groups have deliberately stirred up fears in the business community about the impact of the Bill. They have asserted that the legislation might threaten Australia's economic development by delaying major development, adding to development costs and harming investor confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have turned a blind eye to the fact that our current pattern of economic development threatens the very ecological fabric on which our economy depends. At this point I draw the attention of the Senate to a news release which has been sent to all senators today by the World Wide Fund for Nature with the support of the other major conservation groups. In that press release, Mr Kennedy of WWF draws attention to the fact that in the five-year period 1987 to 1991, the US endangered species Act prompted 73,560 applications seeking advice regarding proposals which potentially threatened a listed species. Of these, only 18&mdash;or 0.0002 per cent&mdash;were stopped from going ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real fact of the matter is that these industry groups are ideologically opposed to legislation to protect endangered species. They would prefer that the Bill was deferred indefinitely or dumped altogether. They have not stated this position publicly. It would be most unwise and unpopular of them to do so, but they have declared repeatedly that the legislation gives too much precedence to the protection of endangered species and not enough to social and economic concerns. They have claimed that the legislation lacks balance and cuts across the ecologically sustainable development process. As I said in my introductory remarks, lying right at the base of that process is the protection of biodiversity and, therefore, the attention which must be given to intergenerational equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Minister for the environment, Mr Jim Carlton, has joined in this chorus by claiming in his speech during the second reading debate that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, Mrs Kelly, has completely bypassed the ESD process in bringing this Bill forward at this time. This is a blatant and wilful misrepresentation of the truth. The fact is that the conservation of biodiversity is, as I have stated before, a basic principle of ESD. Without the full protection of endangered and vulnerable species, ESD cannot be achieved. Strong, effective and enforceable endangered species legislation is a fundamental component of ESD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that some Cabinet Ministers share Mr Carlton's views on this matter, and I guess they are the particular Ministers to whom Senator Baume was referring a moment ago.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's attitude throughout the period in which the legislation was being debated in Cabinet was one of appeasement and accommodation of industry's interests. Industry claimed that the legislation was being rushed through without sufficient consultation. There is an element of truth in that, because, as I have indicated, the Government has promised this legislation for a long, long time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite a bit, Senator Tambling. We will be attempting to move this Bill as far as we can in that direction. My Bill did precisely what the Government promised it would do back in 1990 but has failed to do in this legislation. The Threatened Species Bill 1992, which went through a very lengthy process of consultation with both conservation and industry groups, was designed to put in place a network of management plans across the entire continent, not just in those Territories which come directly under Federal government control. Such a scheme would provide a systematic approach to both species protection and industry development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would mean that where developers want to engage in an activity that would have an impact on threatened species, the developers would know beforehand&mdash;and this is a very important point&mdash;that they could use area A, that they could not use area B or that they could use area C but only under certain conditions that are incorporated in the management plan for that particular area. Such a scheme would lay the foundation for the achievement of ESD. It would mean that economic development could occur within a framework of species conservation and ecosystem protection&mdash;a framework that has been laid down before the developer comes forward with his proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have in the Government's Bill is a system that is guaranteed to arouse community conflict over proposed developments. Without State cooperation, species recovery plans and threat abatement plans cannot be established on 99.8 per cent of the continent. In addition, conservation orders to restrain actions by commercial operators that further threaten a species or ecological community with extinction cannot be imposed on 99.8 per cent of the continent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another of the environmental promises the ALP made before the last election was that the Government would give a major increase in funding for a comprehensive biological survey of Australia to be completed by the year 2000. Again, the ALP has failed to deliver. As my colleague Senator Bell said during the debate on the Threatened Species Bill 1992, grants to the Australian biological resources survey increased from a low of $1.1m in 1990 to only $1.5m in 1992. It has been estimated<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that at this rate of funding the survey would not be completed until the year 3000&mdash;not the year 2000 but the year 3000&mdash;by which time, at the present rate of extinction, most species would have been lost from this continent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that Mrs Kelly announced on 15 October that grants to the biological survey are to be increased to $2.3m in 1993. Whilst this is to be welcomed, the amount still falls far short of what is needed to complete the survey by the year 2000. Only when we know the full range of species of flora and fauna in this continent can we be sure that we can conserve them and that we know enough about their interrelationships to look after them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The timing of this Bill in the Senate is particularly cynical. It was guillotined through the House of Representatives, as Senator Baume said, and brought forward on the Senate legislative program by 10 days. It is quite obvious that the Bill was brought forward to ensure that its passage was secured prior to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announcing his environment statement in mid-December. It is also obvious that the Government wanted the legislation passed this year in case the Prime Minister chose not to reconvene Parliament next year. Clearly, the Australian Democrats support swift action to protect endangered species. However, the Government's belated action was not caused by concern over conservation but over electoral fallout and bad PR if this legislation is not in place before the Prime Minister's environment statement or before the next Federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to examine the Bill more closely: as it stands, the Australian Democrats very reluctantly support this Bill. Although we believe that it has many serious flaws, we will not be voting against it. However, we will be moving a very large number of amendments during the committee stage which, if accepted, will bring the Bill very substantially towards my Threatened Species Bill 1992, which we debated several weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill establishes a nationally agreed list of endangered and vulnerable species. It provides for the establishment of a national list of endangered ecological communities but does not include any such communities on the schedule. It fails to provide for a national list of vulnerable ecological communities. It establishes a list of key threatening processes, but fails to include the most significant process of all; namely, the continued clearance of native vegetation. While the destruction of habitat remains unchecked by this Bill, more species will become threatened and others will be driven closer to extinction. The Bill establishes mechanisms for the preparation and implementation of species recovery plans and threat abatement plans and provides for conservation orders to be imposed on activities that threaten species with extinction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This last point had industry groups in a state of sustained agitation. It was the subject of heated debate in Cabinet. The first draft of the Bill contained a simple and effective procedure for the making of conservation orders. That process was then severely watered down over successive drafts by pressure from industry Ministers in Cabinet. The final result is a convoluted mix of conservation orders that allows too great a consideration of economic and social concerns and too much decision making power in the hands of industry-oriented Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first draft of the Bill provided for limited third party rights to seek injunctions against Commonwealth agencies and for protection against payment of damages. In the Bill before us, the third party may seek an injunction only against the Minister or the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. In the event that the injunction is overturned by a court, third parties now have no protection against payment of damages. This effectively means that third party rights have been gutted in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill fails to guarantee public nomination for endangered or vulnerable species in ecological communities. It fails to address the issue of commercial developments outside Commonwealth areas that require Commonwealth decisions for their approval or operation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are pretty irrelevant. Madam Acting Deputy President, I understand that you have a duty to uphold the decorum of this chamber and I appreciate your conducting your duty in the way that you did. The Democrats are quite nice people, but a bit slow on the uptake. That is why the new Green parties have formed. That is why the intense conservationists have no further faith in the Democrats; they have formed their own parties. The result of this Federal election will be quite interesting because of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to say to the Green parties that they should not fall into the trap that Senator Coulter and his group fell into. Do not trust the ALP with the environment. During the course of the day we have proved that the ALP cannot be trusted with money or jobs, and I say to those parties, `You cannot trust them with the environment either'. The sooner the Greens, and what is left of the Democrats, understand that, the better off we will be. The Green parties will not get everything they ask for from the coalition, but at least they will get a consistent, honest policy that is concerned about the environment and about conservation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proud to be a member of a party that has the conservation and environmental record that the Liberal Party has. Over the years we have demonstrated our genuine concern for the environment which allows the development that this country so badly needs, but which also allows for a genuine concern to protect the environment and to conserve what best needs to be conserved in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the Liberal and National parties believe that Australia can and should conserve endangered species and we believe that we should have development as well. We, and all Australians, want our environment, but we want an economy as well. In dealing with conservation matters and the environment, we need to ensure that we conserve things but that we do it in a sensible way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In leading this debate for the Liberal and National parties, Senator Baume mentioned that we will not be opposing the Bill. We would have liked some more detail and debate in the other place so that we can ensure that the provisions of this Bill are adequate. Having Mrs Kelly in charge of this Bill does not leave one with much confidence. In the time that Mrs Kelly has been in the portfolio, she has achieved a reputation for some unusual decisions&mdash;if can I say that in parliamentary language. She has certainly performed her duties in such a way as not to leave much confidence in her administration of the portfolio. It is not a matter of only people such as myself saying these things, but even some of the more sensible and rational Ministers in the current Government were concerned as to what she might do with this Bill. Indeed, they went to great pains with a lot of debate and a lot of argument, according to the press, to overturn many of the provisions that she originally had included in the Bill. Many of the original provisions, if press reports are to be believed, gave her the sole and unfettered power to make decisions. It would be horrific if anything like that were ever implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, although we support the general thrust of the legislation, and we will not be opposing it&mdash;subject to some amendments which we will be moving&mdash;we do have some concerns. We are concerned that the consultation that took place seems to be very limited. In fact, it appears that the recent inter-governmental agreement on the environment&mdash;which was announced with such flair and which local governments, State governments and the Federal Government all signed&mdash;has in its first test probably been ignored. I may not be correct in saying that, but because of my particular interest in local government, I would ask Senator McMullan to indicate to me what negotiations and consultations there have been with local governments about this legislation whose provisions will have an intense impact upon local authorities around Australia. I fear that there was very little consultation, and that is a matter of real concern in a Bill as important as this. </PARA>

If they want these things introduced&mdash;if they are not just playing politics; if they have a serious desire to do something about amending the Bill to make it more proper and sensible&mdash;one would have thought they would have consulted with us long before this and made us aware of these amendments rather than throwing them on us at the last minute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having received advice on the implications of this Bill, we are concerned about a couple of matters. First, the procedure of allowing the key concept of ecologically sustainable development to be dealt with by a regulation contravenes the principle that important questions of policy and principle should be dealt with in the Act and not in regulations. One can understand why that is a policy and principle. If it is dealt with in legislation, it is debated, it is looked at closely by parliamentarians, it can be referred to groups interested in the matter to comment upon and it can be debated fully in this chamber. If it is done by regulation, it has to be caught going through and procedures have to be implemented to set aside that regulation if someone is vigilant enough to see them and if the Senate is then able to deal with those things. It is certainly being dealt with the wrong way. It should have been done in the normal way&mdash;that is, included in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we are concerned that while the second reading speech states that permanent conservation orders will be made only with the approval of Cabinet, the only advice mentioned in the Bill is that provided by the director of ANPWS and the advisory committee. The same applies to the extension of an interim conservation order beyond 28 days. Those things are of concern to us as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have a great deal to add to what Senator Baume has said. I know that Senator Panizza and Senator Ferguson have very worth while contributions to make that will make our position clearer. I simply want to say before concluding that if the Government's handling of this legislation&mdash;and no doubt the bodies to be set up pursuant to it&mdash;is anything like the Wet Tropics Management agency we have real cause for concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quote an article written by Greg Roberts which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 23 November. He indicated that the Wet Tropics Management agency had spent more than $1m on consultancies but at the same time had failed to release some $30,000 to save a fish that was on the brink of extinction. That shows what that agency is like. It shows what this Government's interests in those sorts of things is all about. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some Government scientists believe that much of the consultancy money&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>details of which we elucidated from the Estimates committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has been squandered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The curator of fishes at the Queensland Museum, Mr Rolly Mackay, said it was disturbing that funds had not been released for such an endangered and unique species as the Lake Eacham rainbow fish.</PARA>

<PARA>But those funds were not available. They were held back by the Wet Tropics Management Authority.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mismanagement of that agency continues. In Estimates I was able to obtain details of a fairly enormous advertising campaign which was being run by that agency in North Queensland. I do not think it was run anywhere else; in fact, the answers in Estimates found that it was not. It was being run, interestingly, in the Cairns, Atherton Tablelands and Townsville region. It just so happens that these three seats are held by Labor at present and are considered to be very marginal. All sensible commentators expect they will change hands at the next election. They are held respectively by Mr Gayler, who is not standing again&mdash;he left the area after tipping a big bucket on the ALP, and rightly so&mdash;Mr Hulls, who holds the seat of Kennedy, which is based on the Atherton Tablelands and out to the west; and Mr Lindsay, who holds the seat of Herbert, based on Townsville. These three seats are in real danger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a massive advertising campaign, particularly on the radio, telling everyone how great this agency was and what great works this agency&mdash;a Commonwealth government agency&mdash;was doing in this area for the environment. They were the sorts of ads that gave us a warm feeling. If we did not know better, we would feel a lot of goodwill to whoever implemented that. But it is all fraud, like everything the ALP does in conservation and environment matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are debating the Endangered Species Protection Bill. We have an endangered species which is just about extinct. It could be saved, but what do the agencies that the ALP set up do? They do not spend $30,000 to save that endangered species; they go out and spent $1m or so on consultancies. These consultants from the south probably had not seen a wet tropic rainforest before they arrived on their expensive consultancies. All the people who live in that area&mdash;people on the Atherton Tablelands, people in Cairns and people in the rainforest areas who have a practical knowledge of that through living with the rainforest all of their lives&mdash;were not consulted. If they had been, they certainly would not have charged $1m. That is the sort of interest that the ALP Government has in those sorts of things. It is good for getting a few votes, but if one is really concerned about the environment and endangered species, one should not come to this Government for anything sensible. </PARA>

My reservations about this legislation are quite simply in relation to the manner in which it would seek to implement those principles. The concern of those of us on this side of the chamber&mdash;National Party senators and Liberal Party senators together&mdash;is that there should be an adequate provision in legislation to provide for the future welfare and well-being of Australians. The legislation with which we are presented is riddled with holes. It is legislation that is arguably excessive in its reach; and legislation which, if amended in the terms proposed by the Australian Democrats this evening&mdash;and I will get onto those proposed amendments later&mdash;would be unacceptably arbitrary and unacceptably restrictive on the development of this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>

It must be made very clear that in this country we cannot live with an increasing population and a declining gross national product.

The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) in her second reading speech said to the House of Representatives that permanent conservation orders would not be put in place without the consent of Cabinet.

In fact, it has hastened the demise of tropical rainforests in Malaysia and South America. We, in this country, had a long term view as to the consistent use of those resources. But when we ceased to harvest tropical hardwood timbers on a sustainable basis, countries such as Malaysia and Brazil went ahead and clear felled. Not only does this nation import $1,800m of timber and timber products a year&mdash;much of it from Malaysia or Latin America where the environmental safeguards which we had even before the takeover of much of our timber industry were in place&mdash;and further erode our balance of payments, but also we achieve absolutely nothing in terms of furthering the worldwide preservation of the environment. </PARA>

He reminds me of mummy's little boy who is the only boy marching in step.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps one could ask why I am speaking on the Endangered Species Protection Bill 1992. I am speaking because of the dangers which I believe it poses to mining and rural development of Australia. Solicitors in this place would know that general contracts always have a catch-all clause. Towards the end of contracts there is always a general clause which catches everything just in case everything else fails to right a wrong. I am afraid that this is the case with the legislation that is now before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said the same thing when the Democrats introduced an endangered species Bill, a threatened species Bill, or whatever they called it. I believe that the environment and species in Australia have been reasonably well looked after without the need for legislation. I believe that this legislation will make no difference whatsoever. As you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, farmers are environmentalists at heart. They have to be because if we do not look after the land, in time it will not look after us. That is the basis on which I approach it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two points stand out about this legislation as far as I am concerned. Of course, this is a coalition concern and fear. First, the coalition is in favour of protecting endangered species, even though I personally think this is unnecessary. Secondly, the coalition is appalled by the way in which this matter has been handled. Either earlier this year or late last year the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) sought to make herself the centre of power in the development of resource projects. She was not worried too much about environmental issues but she wanted to be the sole power in respect of whether resource development in Australia got going. She wanted to give herself the power of veto. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further to that, before this legislation was drawn up the Government or, in this case, probably the Minister, by agreement, was supposed to consult with all the States in Australia in order to bring in legislation that was not centred in Canberra&mdash;because the fountain of all knowledge does not necessarily lie in Canberra&mdash;so that it would take account of the concerns and ideas of the whole of Australia. It has already been pointed out this evening that the Minister broke all of the agreements that were made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the first draft of this Bill saw the light of day, even the Minister's own colleagues did not support it. That is why it was delayed, and especially because it included the veto power. Other Ministers were worried&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;that their portfolios would be threatened by that power of veto. Fortunately, we have Ministers who have a broader view of things than some of the very narrow-minded ones centred here in this supposed seat of power. To that extent, the coalition supports the thrust of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conservationists were promised the world in the run-up to the 1990 election. I do not need to go over that; it has already been pointed out this evening. The Government promised them everything and the Democrats delivered their preferences, even though they claim that they did not. The Green movement acted on what they were promised. They were sucked in in 1990&mdash;hook, line and sinker. Senator Macdonald pointed out that the penny has now dropped. It has taken them nearly three years to wake up to the fact that they were taken in; that they have not received any of this sort of legislation and the Government did not deliver on some of the promises it made during that whole time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that an election is looming, the Government has to do something for the Democrats and the Green lobby group to try to get those votes again, because it was only with those very few votes that the Hawke Government&mdash;not the unelected Prime Minister we have now&mdash;got over the line. So now we are here debating this legislation in the dying months of the Keating Government. Obviously the Greens and the Democrats want something in return for their support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides lists of endangered species. I would like to know the real definition of endangered species. I am not going to accept the definition given by the Government, nor am I going to accept any definition given by the Democrats. I would not accept anything from the Democrats, especially a definition of this sort of thing. The Bill provides lists of endangered species, vulnerable species, presumed extinct native species, and key threatening processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this Bill is very important to the mining and rural industries. My concern is the placing of conservation orders at the whim of a Minister, with the Green lobby groups and the Democrats edging the Minister on. Three kinds of conservation orders can be made under this Bill: an interim order, a permanent order or an impact assessment order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though, on reading the Bill, an interim order seems innocuous, it can be used, and such measures have been used, to hold up very important resource developments in Australia&mdash;developments that can get this country out of the mire that it is in as a result of the actions of this Government over the last 10 years. Forget about a permanent conservation order; even an interim order will cause delay while calls are made for one report after another. The impact assessment also can hold things up for a mighty long time. Impact assessments are a boon for these Green lobby groups that act as consultants. It is a way for the Government to put much needed funds into their organisation and the Democrat organisation. If one asks enough questions at Estimates hearings for the Budget, one will find that out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The all embracing power of the Minister has gone from this Bill, and rightly so. There are restrictions on what the Minister can do in regard to such an investigation. We need that; otherwise we will have the abuses of power that we have seen in all parts of Australia. The abuse of power probably started off in the famous Coronation Hill case. Then we saw it occur in other places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my State of Western Australia, a $350m project at Marandoo was held up for at least two years by irrational demands for report after report. Everything was used&mdash;Aboriginal heritage and sacred sites. This is what the catch-all clause does. When it looked as though that project would get off the ground, the pebble mound mouse appeared. We were told that Marandoo was its natural habitat and the only place in Australia that it was found. I heard that excuse for not going ahead with an extension to the freeways near Perth approximately 25 years ago. That excuse is used for whatever whim&mdash;whatever is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the case of Yakabindie. Senator Chamarette can laugh as much as she likes; she had better laugh now as she will not be here much longer. The project at Yakabindie was worth at least $200m. It was held up for two years. It now virtually has the go-ahead&mdash;after the thirteenth report. The biggest objector to that project was a white Aboriginal who was born in Queensland. He was supposed to be living in the area, but he lives in a two-storey mansion in Leonora in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $200m project at Mount Todd in the Northern Territory was held up by the whims of radical groups. I believe the hold-up there was due to the goulden finch. Various other projects have been held up. Shark Bay in Western Australia was involved with the pastoral industry. That is where this endangered species process started by throwing out the family that had been on the station probably for the last 100 years. Senator Richardson, the Minister for the environment at the time, helped that to take place. I could give dozens of examples where this sort of thing has happened in Western Australia. The very few projects I have mentioned tonight total at least $1 billion in forgone resource development in Australia. What would that have done for the economy of Australia in the last two years? The figure of $1 billion represents only the lost development; there is also the lost production which would have flowed from that. It would have done a lot for the economy, especially considering the balance of payments figures that came out today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These sorts of measures were aided and abetted by the now disgraced Western Australian Minister for the environment, Bob Pearce, who was removed from office&mdash;well, he removed himself from office but the Royal Commission in Western Australia really did that for him. He fell prey to the environmental groups to keep him and his Government in power, and almost $1 billion worth of resource development was lost in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, this sort of legislation is the catch-all clause. It will be used and abused by the Democrats and their greenie support groups and the result will be the holding up of resources. Senator Tate looks at me, but we know that the State of Tasmania was the first State in Australia to suffer from the holding up of resource development. It started with the Franklin River dam in, I think, 1983 and spread to the rest of Australia, and Senator Tate knows the results in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said when I started speaking in this debate, I am very worried about the endangered species in Australia, but I am also very worried about another endangered species in Australia; that is, the farmers and miners&mdash;the 5 per cent of Australia which supplies at least 65 per cent and beyond of Australia's export income which keeps Australia afloat even in these hard times. I will leave it at that and I certainly will be supporting the amendments moved by my colleagues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Endangered Species Protection Bill 1992 because, like all senators in this chamber&mdash;not just the Democrats who seem to think they have some divine right to represent conservation interests in Australia&mdash;I am concerned about the conservation and preservation of all that is unique about Australia for my children and for future generations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is whether this Bill provides us with the best method of doing that. By far the most important concern I have&mdash;and one that I have not heard raised yet&mdash;is whether this legislation will actually save one endangered species from extinction. What measures does this Bill contain which will actively save endangered species? It provides for lists of endangered, vulnerable and presumed extinct species; advisory committees to advise the Minister on obligations under the Act and the lists; recovery and threat abatement plans; conservation orders; and the imposition of obligations to protect species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what do these measures really mean? I would suggest that they basically mean locking up areas of Australia, an idea which would at first appear to have some merit. I say appear to have merit because I am afraid that it is quite illusory. The whole world has lost 60 species of mammals in the last 500 years; Australia, a single country, has lost 20 species of mammals in the last 200 years&mdash;and I have heard it said that we are the endangered species vandals of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what have we been doing about it? What we have been doing is locking up areas of Australia, which only means putting an invisible line around an area on a map. It does absolutely nothing positive or concrete to actively save those endangered species. Despite the best of intentions, it has not slowed the rate of extinction of our endangered species, especially on the eastern seaboard. The policy of locking up areas of Australia has obviously failed. In fact, it might be the quickest way to get rid of endangered species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not an opinion I have arrived at without some consultation. One person I have consulted and whose opinion I respect because of his role in actually increasing the numbers of some of our species, against the tide, is Dr John Walmsley of the Warrawong Sanctuary in South Australia, whom I am sure Senator Coulter would have had some dealings with. He has used private funds to create his sanctuary which now provides a haven for animals like the yellow footed rock wallaby, the numbat and the brush tailed bettong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only does the Warrawong Sanctuary not get any direct assistance from the Federal Government&mdash;which says it is so concerned about our endangered species&mdash;but it does not get any indirect assistance either. If Dr Walmsley were running sheep on his property he would not even pay land tax, and he could buy some goods sales tax free, including the vehicle he would use to go around his property to check on the animals in the same way that a farmer might check on his sheep. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does the Government not want to encourage people to create sanctuaries for our endangered species? Quite frankly, I think the answer is no. Dr Walmsley is quite happy to give examples of cases where the South Australian Government has locked up areas for the purpose of saving the yellow footed rock wallaby, and those wallabies have now completely disappeared. Why? Because these areas are not managed. Management means doing exactly what Dr Walmsley has done&mdash;fencing in an area, no matter how large that area might be, and then eradicating major threats to endangered species within that fenced area, such as feral cats and foxes, to name but a couple. This is how Dr Walmsley has increased the numbers of yellow footed rock wallabies and other endangered species, while outside the fenced-in area the number of species across Australia continues to decline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can save our wildlife and that is what the Warrawong Sanctuary and the Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management are doing. They are the only two groups in Australia that are actively managing their land, and they should be commended for it. These two areas are the only places in Australia where endangered species numbers are not decreasing. So where are their funds from any Federal government? Where is the legislation that follows their good example and implements their ideas?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that there is no point in locking up areas of Australia if there is no attempt to eradicate the real problem. In order to illustrate this problem, I would like to make a brief reference to the creation of the wilderness areas by the Victorian Government. The aim is to preserve different environments from the highlands to the plains of the Mallee for future generations. A total of only 4 per cent of Victorian land is now protected, yet even this could be wasted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the point of creating wilderness areas if the land is not managed? What if brambles and other examples of wild vegetation are allowed to overtake and ruin the forest in the Victorian highlands? What if wild brumbies and other feral animals are allowed to graze and trample rare plants unchecked? What if grass growing out of control allows bushfires to spread far further and far quicker than if there had been some control of the undergrowth? What if cats and foxes and other feral animals continue to have access to this area, killing endangered animal species at will?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not just raising these points in passing. They are concerns that have been raised by Dr Tim Flannery of the Australian Museum in Sydney and by one of Australia's most eminent natural historians, Charles McCubbin. Mr McCubbin is particularly interested in the fate of the potoroo in far East Gippsland in Victoria. He is a committed environmentalist and conservationist, but he is also a realist. He knows that locking up areas of land is not necessarily the answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, as my colleague the honourable member for Corangamite, Mr McArthur, pointed out in a speech in the House of Representatives, a recent study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources found, in support of what I have just stated, that the major threats for our wildlife and plants are fire, and introduced species such as foxes and cats. Contrary to popular belief, the International Union found that most extinctions of species were not due to the clearing of farmland, disease or over-hunting. Yet we continue to focus on these issues as well as mining and development as the causes of extinctions. Our endangered species desperately need help, and yet all we do is avoid the real causes and the real problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why? What is the problem with fencing off areas, eliminating feral animals from these areas, providing enough staff to actively monitor these areas and providing tax incentives for these sanctuaries to exist? I am not sure that I know the answer to this, but I do know that at a recent council meeting of the Australian Conservation Foundation it was decided not to get involved in the feral cat debate because it would potentially lose too many cat-loving members. What an outrageous decision. Is the Australian Conservation Foundation in support of our endangered species or not? I know that in South Australia there are 22 million hectares of national parks, yet fewer people are employed to look after this large area than are employed to take care of the Adelaide City Council gardens. I think this is a deplorable state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a lot to learn, and one source we can learn from is our primary producers and rural communities. They might not have come up with all the answers, but they certainly know what many of the problems are. Our farmers and our rural communities have been leading the way in protecting our environment because they live not in high rise apartments or suburbia but on the land. They see the result of our past bad practices and they, more than anyone else, see that the way forward is to pursue farming and development in harmony with the environment and our plants and animals. Primary producers had to cope first with deforestation and its devastating results, and now they are replanting substantial areas of Australian farming land to combat soil erosion. They had to cope first with the rising water table and the disastrous effect of salt on crops in the local environment, and now they are working actively to combat salinity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers had to cope with the devastating effects of the introduction of animals and pests such as the fox, the cane toad, the rabbit, the wild goat, the wild pig and the donkey. Yes, I am aware that primary producers have contributed to these environmental problems and the extinction of many endangered species. But the point is that while the people in the cities have only recently been jumping up and down about the environment and our wildlife our rural communities have quietly gone about doing something about it. There are hundreds of land care groups all over Australia. The people who belong to these groups really care about the environment, and I am sure that they care about our endangered native wildlife and plants&mdash;and so do people involved in Australian industry. Yet during the debate on the Democrats' Threatened Species Bill on 15 October Senator Bell said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry groups have shown very clearly that they do not want endangered species legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not accept this. What makes Senator Bell think that people involved in industry, people with jobs, care less about the future of the planet than anyone else? I do not subscribe to the view that one has to be a Democrat, a university student or unemployed to care about our native wildlife and plants. People who work in and own Australia's industries come from all walks of life. By far the majority of these people, regardless of which way they vote, care about our endangered species and our environment. I certainly do not accept that people involved in the mining sector and primary industries do not care about endangered species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that we must address when we look at this legislation on endangered species is one of balance. How can we care about endangered species and still care about our economy, our jobs, and our industry? What we need now is a balanced approach, one that puts more emphasis on earning income from our unique wildlife and environment, one that encourages ecologically sustainable development and one that allows the future growth and prosperity of industry without harming our environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports this Bill, but with some reservations. We must learn to be innovative in our approach to protecting the environment; we must recognise that development and industry are here to stay and come up with ways of ensuring that they do not further harm our planet; and, most of all, we should learn from the quiet achievers of the Australian environment movement, our primary producers, who have learned that confrontation might get media headlines but only distracts from the job that must be done. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government and the Opposition stand condemned for not supporting the Democrats' legislation and forcing the Senate to try to rebuild the essential elements of that legislation into the Government's compromised and ineffectual Bill. That is why we need all the amendments. I have a philosophical commitment to the protection of biodiversity. Thankfully, this commitment is shared by many others worldwide and is beginning to be reflected in international conventions and agreements. The most recent and most publicised convention in this regard is the Biodiversity Convention which was signed at the Earth Summit in Rio in June of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Animals and plants should have a right equal to that of humans to an existence on this planet. There is an analogy to the common law duty that we all have to other human beings. This duty should be extended to include all animals and plants. Some industry groups, together with some members of the Government and Opposition, feel, however, that this commitment to protect biodiversity is at odds with the need to ensure continued economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr John Prescott, the head of BHP, for example, said in a letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that endangered species legislation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . would cut right across the Government's support for balanced development and would harm the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA>This represents an extremely short-sighted and narrow view of what is in the long term interests not simply of the nation but of the planet. Mr Prescott went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would place an over-riding value on conservation values at the expense of other interests in the community.</PARA>
<PARA>Which community was he referring to? It was the human community at the expense of the natural world. These sorts of comments reflect a philosophy which sees humans as separate from and dominant over nature. Dr David Attenborough, however, sees us in a proper context. I quote him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main value of ecosystems, of course is that we all live in them. The jargon use of the word ecosystem tempts you to think that it's what goes on in a national park or somewhere round the corner. We live in networks of relationships with animals and plants, big and small, of which we are a central part. But we can't live without plants, because without plants we can't feed, and the whole system is so interlocked that if you start messing about with one part, you inevitably affect other parts of it, and, in fact, you affect yourself and the rest of the human beings.</PARA>
<PARA>The industry and Government perspective is therefore narrow, short-sighted and anthropocentric. If we are to work towards a truly sustainable future&mdash;not, may I point out, the distorted industry view of ESD&mdash;we must view biodiversity protection as paramount in government policy decisions. We must ensure that future generations are able to live on a planet that is rich in diversity and with a multitude of healthy life supporting ecosystems. There is an overwhelming need to protect not just individual species but the ecosystems and habitats that sustain them. It is a sad indictment of this Bill that this principle is not enshrined in it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth noting at this point that the introduction of this Bill is substantially behind the schedule initially proposed by the Government. Senator Coulter mentioned earlier that it was seven years ago that the Labor Party first promised this legislation. I understand that the Government was promising that it would be introduced by the end of last year at the conservation groups peak council meeting with Minister Kelly in September 1991. The Government was obviously too busy trying to push through a Forest Conservation and Development Bill, which would have had dire consequences for the ecosystems of Australia's remaining forest if it was passed. It is deeply disappointing that Cabinet has agreed to try to implement this legislation yet again. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a tragedy for Western Australia that the mining of Marandoo may go ahead. Enormous amounts of water and the hydrology of the area will be endangered by the draining of the water table. It was interesting to hear the defence of these industries by Senator Panizza. One wonders whether he would be prepared to declare whether he had any financial interests in them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must add that industry complaints that this legislation will harm employment are unjustified. I will quote from a Worldwide Fund For Nature press release. Mr Kennedy, of that association, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry continues to perpetuate the myth of job loss and industry disinvestment as a perceived result of the Commonwealth endangered species legislation, while ignoring the reality of the United States experience. . . . Facts show that during a five year period (1987-1991) the US <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Endangered Species Act</EMPHASIS> prompted 73,560 applications seeking advice regarding proposals which potentially threatened a listed species. Of all these, only 18 (.0002%) were stopped from going ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Strong Commonwealth legislation will not affect employment levels in Australia, nor contribute to nervous financial markets . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition's amendments recount the fact that it believes this legislation bypassed the ecologically sustainable development process and ignored the intergovernmental agreement on the environment. In the first place, the need for this legislation is integral to the ESD process. It is a presupposition of it and in no way conflicts with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, in terms of the intergovernmental agreement, we need Federal powers and corporation powers. We do not need to wait for States' agreement. We need proper Commonwealth legislation. Regrettably, this legislation does not provide that; it only covers Commonwealth land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government Bill is extremely limited in its coverage. As mentioned by Senator Coulter, it covers 0.2 per cent of Australia instead of extending its area quite legitimately across the Commonwealth. I will now quote from a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program involving Michael Kennedy in a discussion regarding Minister Kelly's powers:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We know full well that within the Constitution there are a range of powers that can be used by the Federal Government to step in to save species in a State that doesn't take action.</PARA>
<PARA>He refers then to the Franklin dam, an issue where the Government had the will to intervene and, in doing so, was successful. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think our advice is that there are enough powers within that Constitution to cover most of the State, and the parts that were left that we couldn't cover are insignificant. So yes, you can use Commonwealth powers.</PARA>
<PARA>I will now cite the support we have had from community groups for the Democrat amendments and for this legislation, even though it is in such a weakened form. Greenpeace stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This watered-down piece of legislation represents a pathetic greenwashing exercise. . . . Without these amendments&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Democrat amendments&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the legislation lacks any real mechanism to protect the habitats of our endangered wildlife.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats' amendments would have eliminated the complicated processes associated with three forms of Interim Conservation Orders. They would have defined more precisely the concept of killing or injuring an endangered species so that it gave protection to the habitat of species as well.</PARA>
<PARA>Greenpeace continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The brawl between Mrs Kelly and her proextinction Cabinet colleagues has left the legislation in tatters. . . . The watered-down legislation is a clear indication that the anti-environment henchmen in Keating's Cabinet have won the day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of this process, the Prime Minister has shown that he lacks the leadership to drive the government towards an ecologically sustainable future. Species will continue to become extinct, forests will continue to be clearfelled and our waterways will continue to be contaminated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this is any indication of the Prime Minister's commitment to the environment, his so-called Environment Statement to be delivered later this month will be an absolute joke.</PARA>
<PARA>The Worldwide Fund For Nature believes that the Commonwealth's endangered species legislation is weak in several important respects, but nonetheless supports its passage through Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conservation and long term survival of many threatened species will come to depend upon its more progressive provisions. The Worldwide Fund is particularly concerned about the following matters. These are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The legislation does not contain overriding Commonwealth powers; (2) There is no public, species/communities/threatening processes, nomination process; (3) The interim conservation order provisions are far too weak; (4) Third party rights are also far too weak; and (5) There is no provision to control the activities of Australian nationals overseas; (6) There is no immediate listing of critical habitats; (7) The legislation contains irrelevant and obstructionist references to economic and social considerations and the ESD.</PARA>
<PARA>So we can see that there is support for this Bill. Any legislation which hopes to fully protect species should include the full protection of habitats of endangered species, including the listing of vulnerable ecological communities; the ability for members of the public to nominate species for listing; and placing the protection of an endangered species above all monetary interests or the so-called national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seriously considered the suggestion that I not support this Bill on the basis that it is too weak to provide any real level of protection for any species. Ultimately, however, I feel that it is better to have some form of protection than none. However, I trust that both the Government and Opposition members of this place will seriously consider all the amendments that are proposed by Senator Coulter and the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government especially is to honour its commitment to ecologically sustainable development, it must enact an endangered species Bill that truly provides protection to the ecosystems which provide the life support systems that we and future generations will continue to rely on for our very existence.

A healthy ecosystem is an absolute necessity for our survival, not a luxury. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is correct. Senators would remember that in the frantic lead-up to the election, and in an effort to save its own hide, the Government became involved in a massive trade-off to the Green movement back in 1990. We do not need reminding that the Green movement is now very angry because the promises that the Government made have not been kept, like a lot of other promises it made before the last election. In other words, in 1992 we are back to 1990 revisited.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite significant that we are looking to the Prime Minister making a major statement on the environment in the next week or two, and a lot of promises will be made once again. The Democrats must feel a bit peeved about this legislation, because it was the Democrats who first promoted this endangered species legislation around Australia. In fact, I was the only Federal politician who attended their launch in Hobart when Senator Coulter launched the Democrats' endangered species legislation campaign. It was quite well attended although it was a pretty cold night. All in all, the Democrats have tried to highlight something they are very concerned about. People on both sides of the chamber are very concerned about this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this occasion the Democrats have been gazumped. For political purposes, the Government grabbed the Democrats legislation&mdash;just as it did in 1990&mdash;and came up with this compromise. Now it is trying to push it through. We are supporting it, as are the Democrats, but the legislation is watered down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to remember the amount of money that this Government has put into placating the Greens over the years; the amount of taxpayers' money that this Government is handing out every year to keep the Green movement quiet. For example, from 1990 to 1992 the Australian Conservation Foundation received $341,000 of taxpayers' funds. The World Wide Fund for Nature received another $56,000 of taxpayers' funds and the Wilderness Society received a similar amount. It can be seen that the Government is prepared to pay whatever is necessary to keep the Green groups on side and in the next few weeks there will be another effort from the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also very important to take the opportunity to reaffirm and reiterate in this debate the coalition's commitment to the environment. The coalition is often misrepresented by both the Government and the Democrats who seem to believe that they have a mortgage on caring for the environment. As a member of the animal welfare Committee, I, together with my colleague Senator Brownhill, Senator Bell from the Democrats and Senator Cooney&mdash;it was before Senator Sherry's time&mdash;looked at the effect that large feral animals were having on endangered species in central and northern Australia. We were just as caring, and still are, as any environmentalist in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, we were shocked to see the effect that wild horses were having on native flora and fauna in Australia. In fact, wild horses, camels, donkeys and foxes have been responsible for removing some 50 species of flora and fauna from our landscape. It is all very well to criticise the farmers, developers and mining industries for the effect they have had, but by far the biggest effect on flora and fauna in this country has come from introduced animals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand the feelings of the average man in the street when he sees horses being shot, donkeys being killed and rabbits being poisoned. All the do-gooders say, `You are not allowed to do this. You are not allowed to shoot horses and poison rabbits'. In fact, my Whip's predecessor, Senator Kilgariff, had one of the largest infestations of rabbits just south of Alice Springs and it totally devastated his property. There was no other way to get rid of them than to gas or poison them. If that had not happened, the area would have become a wasteland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the Democrats and the Government do not have a mortgage on caring for the environment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again I repeat, the coalition has a very sound record in relation to protecting the environment. One has only to remember the decisions made on Fraser Island, for instance, the fact that we were the first to promote the anti-minerals regime in the Antarctic, and the support we gave to retaining the huskies in Antarctica just this week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to remember that the manner in which the Government and the Minister for the environment, Ros Kelly, handled this Bill was a disgrace. There is no doubt that the Bill will have far-reaching effects for the future of this country. It was debated for about one hour in the House of Representatives. Apart from that, most key groups associated with the environment in either a government or voluntary capacity received only a week to consider the Bill. I believe that that was because the Minister was defeated by her colleagues in the Cabinet, who realised that the draft Bill she had placed before the Cabinet was totally unacceptable. I do not believe that that is the way legislation should be passed through the House or debated in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight, without any notice or consultation, we have this huge wad of Democrat amendments, some 81 of them. They might be well thought out amendments, but what hope do we have as an Opposition of considering any of them before they are put tonight? It is totally unfair. It seems that Senator Chamarette has had a fair time to look at them, but my colleagues, and especially Senator Baume&mdash;who is in charge of this matter on our behalf and who is, like myself, totally committed to the environment&mdash;have had no opportunity to see these 81 amendments. As I said earlier, the Democrats were the first to promote this endangered species legislation around the country, and they did a reasonable job of it.

It looks as though that is also going to be overridden.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that the coalition does want this legislation to pass and we are prepared to support its passage through the chamber. A couple of amendments will be moved by my colleagues Senator Baume and Senator Macdonald. I am terribly disappointed that, having supported the Democrats when they launched their campaign on the endangered species legislation, for which I am prepared to give them credit, I find that they are obviously not prepared to give the Opposition any credit for caring about endangered species. They could not even be bothered to show us the amendments they intend to move. I think that is most disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter that concerns me is the fact that this legislation refers to Commonwealth waters. I understand that, to date, there has been little or no consultation with the fishing industry. It is likely that over the ensuing years there will be increased environmental pressure upon those who fish for a living in Australia's waters. Whilst I agree that we need to protect our species&mdash;as a Tasmanian, I have seen the scallop industry raped, and I believe that eventually the orange roughie resource will be in some danger&mdash;I do not think there has been enough investigation of the effects of this Bill on the fishing industry. I trust that, if this Bill is passed, we will not see the Green movement and the Government use it to prevent rational development. It is repeatedly brought home to me that some sections of the community do not want to see development occur at any cost. I believe that that is a totally unsustainable view, given the economic crisis we are experiencing at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I wish to make is that I believe it is necessary to consider the effect of the permanent conservation orders that can be made on Commonwealth lands and waters by the environment Minister. The Minister in her second reading speech in the other place indicated that such orders would be made only with the approval of Cabinet. However, this is not prescribed in the legislation. That is totally unsatisfactory because, inevitably, that situation will be put to the test. I would not like to see a determination being based upon a court's interpretation of the Minister's second reading speech. As I said, we are supporting this legislation, but I reiterate my concerns about these Democrat amendments and their lack of consultation with our shadow Minister who is handling this Bill. </PARA>

Senator O'Chee in his contribution tonight made some very sound points about the timber deficit we have and the pressures that are put on other forests around the world if we lock up country in Australia. That is something we have always got to look at. At present we are importing a lot more timber than we are exporting, and that is also causing us economic problems.

When one looks at the protracted history of this legislation, the Government has tried yet again to be all things to all people but it is now failing to satisfy anyone. It is not satisfying the Democrat people from the Green movement. We do not believe that this legislation is anywhere near ideal either. It has got problems for both sides of the debate. As I said, the Government has tried to be all things to all people and it really has not achieved much at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The various conservation groups have pushed for their amendments. They are not happy, but they will support the Democrats' amendments. I do not know whether those amendments are being moved by Greenpeace or by the Democrats. Obviously, they all know a lot more about them than we do because we received them only a little while ago. This shows that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) is rather out of her depth on environmental subjects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the protection of species of flora and fauna that are endangered or vulnerable or come within Commonwealth jurisdiction on land or sea. Of significance is the fact that it can affect any activity for which Commonwealth approval is necessary. I immediately think back to the long-footed potoroo, supposedly found in the south-east forests of New South Wales. As I understand it, the long-footed potoroo has not been sighted yet. Tragically, it held up development in that area. All that was found of that animal was a hair in the dung of a fox. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That dramatically held up the development of that area. I ask honourable senators whether they have seen the long-footed potoroo. If they have, they should let somebody know, because people have actually been down in the forest looking for it for years. As I understand it, no evidence has been found except for that bit of hair in the fox dung. Taking that further than the forestry debate on endangered species, if one sees what is considered to be an endangered species, farming may be stopped. If there had been an endangered species on the site of Parliament House, maybe Parliament House would not have been built. I wonder whether that has been cleared up well enough in the legislation as it stands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the debate in the other place, this legislation was, as is usual for the Government, guillotined through the chamber; everyone has made that point very clearly here tonight. For most of the one hour allowed for the debate, the Minister did not even have the courtesy to attend the chamber in the other place. That is as much interest as she had in that debate.

To ask legislators&mdash;whether they be legislators trying to do the right thing or legislators trying to ram things through without any decent scrutiny, as the Keating-Labor Government is trying to do at the moment&mdash;to consider 70-odd Bills in the last three weeks of Parliament is a disgrace. </PARA>

The legislation was adjusted to take into account the legitimate concerns of industry and conservation groups, while still maintaining its integrity.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think the legislation now has as much integrity as it could have had because it has tried to be, as I said in the first instance, all things to all people. That is a sad thing because, as I said earlier, we on this side of the chamber believe in protecting endangered species and in protecting the environment, but we definitely do not believe in bad legislation. In the long term, I do not think that this legislation will do all the things that the legislators want it to do. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go too far in restricting people in this country we will find industries being lost. We will also have an even worse economy than that which the Keating Labor Government has given this country. We are told that there was consultation with the States. As I understand it, that consultation did not happen. But even though it has not happened the Government has not been deterred from pushing ahead. The Government has obviously read the various media commentators who say that the Labor Party needs to once again stitch up the conservation vote.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sherry makes the point that the Government got there. It did not get there because it was people's first or second choice; it got there because people seeking to cast a vote of protest against the Government foolishly followed the Green how to vote card and ended up at the bottom of the ticket casting a vote for the Labor Party because its name happened to be but one above that of the Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was in that context that this legislation was manifest. It was first prepared exclusively in the divine office of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, Mrs Kelly, who has spent the whole time she has been in that portfolio seeking to inherit the mantle that was passed on to her by Senator Graham Richardson&mdash;that is, to ingratiate herself with the more extreme and radical elements of the conservation movement. Her problem has been that, as distinct from the obvious signs of the period of Senator Richardson being the Minister for the Environment, the economy has for the duration of the last three years continued to spiral downwards and plunge us into the depths of abject recession. Cabinet has been understanding enough to recognise that there is not a great deal of sympathy to be had in the community for those who are driving a harsh radical environment policy to the detriment of the economy. So the support for the environment and the environmental movement has, to some degree, been diminished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even this dopey Cabinet has woken up to the fact that unless we have a strong, virile economy we simply cannot have conservation. Even the most unenlightened minds have only to cast their eyes upon the environmental considerations in the Third World countries to see the degradation that takes place there simply because they do not have the foundation of a substantial economy to allow them to consider such matters as the environment and quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other problems for Mrs Kelly, which is well known, is that she is so politically dopey. I well remember her being interviewed on the radio one morning observing that she was doing her bit for the environment because she was now driving a smaller motor car. Not only did she not know what brand of motor car she was driving, but also when she was asked a very benign question by the interviewer, who was trying to help her along, about the size of motor car she had, its engine size and what the reduction in fuel consumption was, she did not have the slightest idea. It was an example of her typical tokenism towards being concerned about the environment and portraying herself as having some affinity with the more radical movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to observe that in exactly the same week as Mrs Kelly chose to climb out of a six-cylinder and into a four-cylinder motor car she got into a VIP Falcon jet and flew up to Sydney to make a fool of herself on the Steve Vizard show. The reason that she was in that jet at a cost of $10,000 an hour, which was spewing out gas into the environment, was that earlier in the evening she had been at the Lodge celebrating the Canberra Raiders' victory. We all know that she is their mascot and she could not afford to not be there on that occasion. That shows us the concern that Mrs Kelly has for the environment. She will drive around Canberra symbolically in a small motor car but get in a jet aircraft and fly up to Sydney to plonk her bottom on a chair next to Steve Vizard to make a fool of herself in the name of whatever causes she purports to represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is somewhat of a compromise by the Labor Cabinet. It has watered down some of the more extreme provisions, not the least being the intrinsic concentration of power which was originally in the hands of the Minister. It has been a compromise. The more pragmatic minds in Cabinet understand the absurdity of her original notion, but she can serve up this trash and this tripe legislation and when she gets rolled she can go back to the Green movement and say, `Don't blame me, I'm on your side' and in that way seek to continue to ingratiate herself for the cause of the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of features of this legislation which I find obnoxious, but time prevents me from canvassing them all. To start with, the Minister gave a commitment to the Ministerial Council that the Bill would be drawn up in consultation with the States and following the report of the task force on endangered species protection. The Minister has effectively disregarded the intergovernmental agreement on the environment. The industry has expressed its disappointment that the Minister has bypassed the ecologically sustainable process which has involved considerable resources from industry. It has really made a mockery of that total process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definitions and the grounds upon which the Minister's decisions are made are not specific, which means that economic development will be left to the whims and discretion of the Minister responsible for the Act. No doubt, as in the past, her decisions will be driven by political expediency, not responsible and mature economic considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Business Council of Australia very wisely observes that it is disappointed that the Bill does not adequately cater for economic considerations. Again, this Government shows it has no balance. It does not see a consideration and contemplation of the competing and conflicting considerations which go into making sensible and rational decisions at the end of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Farmers Federation has observed that the major deficiency in the legislation as far as it is concerned is that the process does not require economic and social impact considerations prior to listing a species with only conservation issues being considered at that stage, which is very much the point being made by the Business Council of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The schedules in this Bill contain a list of 327 animal and plant species considered as endangered; a list of 725 species considered to be vulnerable; and a list of 113 species presumed extinct. This is a list of over 1,000 existing species, overwhelmingly of plants. Animals represent 73 of the 300 endangered species and 66 of the 725 vulnerable species. Overwhelmingly, we are obsessed with preserving plants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to observe by way of comparison, to place the proposed legislation in some sort of context, that the USA has a list of 728 endangered or threatened species with a further 4,000 to be considered. It is odd that the USA, 20 years after implementing the endangered species Act, has a list which is smaller than our starting point. The US Department of the Interior has estimated that it will take between 38 and 49 years just to list the species likely to warrant listing from the 4,000 under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with this legislation in Australia, presumably the ultimate aim of species legislation in the USA is to recover and de-list animals and plants which are in danger of extinction. In the two decades that the United States has had legislation, it has not achieved the de-listing of any species in a meaningful way. Only four de-listings have taken place. I think one of those was due to the discovery of previous errors. Three recoveries involved birds limited to a particular island where the discovery of additional birds led to their de-listing. The fourth recovery involved a plant, also due to initial data error, which meant that the plant should not have been listed in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that this legislation is the epitome of political expediency, driven by the imperative of being rammed and jammed through this chamber prior to the next Federal election so that the Prime Minister can proffer it as the fulfilment of a commitment made at the last election, in the desperate hope that he can again recapture the Green vote. I observe that we have something like 82 amendments&mdash;a matter that has been raised by a number of other speakers. I do not know whether it is a conspiracy to keep the Opposition plunged into some form of political darkness or whether it is just, as Senator Robert Ray would say, a typical Democrat stuff-up that we were not advised earlier on. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the motion, add:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">", but the Senate expresses its grave concern that, in presenting the legislation, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories has by-passed the Ecologically Sustainable Development process and ignored the Inter-Governmental Agreement on the Environment".</PARA>
<PARA>The intergovernmental agreement on the environment purports to govern relations between the various tiers of government on environmental matters. What we are seeing in the progress of this legislation through the Parliament at this time is nothing short of a steamrolling of the process of the intergovernmental agreement on the environment. We all know that the agreement is a very vital and important one between the Commonwealth and the States and the Territories. The aims of the agreement are essentially to seek a cooperative approach to the environment by defining the roles of the various tiers of government and reducing the potential for disputation. What has happened to the intergovernmental agreement on the environment? It has been torn up; it has been shredded. It obviously has not been observed, and the Commonwealth has walked away from the obligations it would normally have had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we recognise that Commonwealth and State financial relations are littered with examples of States complaining about the Federal Government cajoling through conditional financial assistance. We are now seeing a similar set of events happening here. The Labor Government's commitment to cooperation with the States and the Territories is just shallow rhetoric. What else has been brought out by the process of this legislation? As several of my colleagues have mentioned, it is important that the Democrats have consulted through their network, very obviously, in recent days, weeks or months or whatever it has been, through the network of Greenpeace, the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Wilderness Society. As I heard Senator Coulter interject, there were some draft guidelines or outlines of the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Were those outlines presented to him as a fait accompli from those particular organisations or some representative group or were they presented by the Democrats for discussion to a constituency? They did not have the courage to share them with anyone else. Who else saw those guidelines? Did the States or the Territories? Was industry consulted to see whether there was any common ground at all in any of the issues? No. What happened is that the Democrats wheeled in here today 81 amendments, in the hope of doing some sort of backroom deal with the Government to put them through. The Democrats' treatment on this particular issue is well known. I had representations about this legislation back in September from the Northern Territory Fishing Industry Council. I quote from the representation that was made to me:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We wish to bring to your attention the fact that the Commonwealth Endangered Species Protection Bill will create significant problems for all land and marine based industries in Australia, including agriculture, forestry, mining, oil and fishing.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that this legislation will hinder Australia's economy and may not be the best way to protect endangered species. We therefore urge you to stop the current initiative of the Minister for the Environment to allow for more consultation and debate to determine the best means of protecting our endangered species without risking economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a very important representation. I am sure that many honourable senators would be aware of the concerns of the mining industry. I am certainly aware of various comments made by the Northern Territory Chamber of Mines and Petroleum and the advice and involvement it has sought in working through this legislation to ensure that there is a proper way of developing it. I am aware that Mr John Prescott, the chief of BHP, wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in September to say that giving a single Minister such powers would be against the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also very important, in looking at the mining considerations, to know what projects may be threatened at this time. Again, if I use the Northern Territory example, the Government has been, to its credit, fast-tracking the development proposals for the McArthur River developments of Mount Isa Mines near Borroloola. Similarly, I am aware that Mr Brereton and other Ministers, in conjunction with Ministers from the Northern Territory Government, have been seeking to get the Mount Todd gold mine under way early next year. I will bet the Democrats have not consulted with Mount Isa Mines or with Zapopan to find out whether there is any implication for those major projects, which are worth hundreds of millions of dollars and hundreds of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A week or so ago&mdash;I think it was on 20 November&mdash;I met with the Executive Officer of the Northern Territory Environment Council, Mr Jamie Pittock. We discussed a number of important environment issues, including this legislation. The concern of Mr Pittock certainly did not align in a number of areas with the other concerns that I had had from other constituents. But Mr Pittock alerted me to the fact that this legislation was flawed and needed further discussion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I am sure that some of the issues the Democrats may have put forward in amendments might go some way towards meeting some of the Environment Council's concerns, as a constituent representative I would like the time and the opportunity to consult and find out where they are and whether the Democrat amendments are nothing more than something that has been conspired in some back room against national interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier that I was very angry because of the steamrolling effect against the inter-government agreement on the environment. This negotiating process has now been totally thwarted. Let me just track through some very important dates. In March 1990 the then Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke, announced the intention of the Federal Government to pass legislation to protect endangered species during the lifetime of the current Parliament. A year later, in April 1991 the Endangered Species Advisory Council provided Mrs Kelly with an options paper on endangered species legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In early 1992, the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories released a paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth Endangered Species Legislation&mdash;The Proposal</EMPHASIS>. I am aware that the Northern Territory Government was involved with this legislative process from about that particular point. Certainly, in July 1992 at the third Australia-New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council meeting, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories gave an assurance that any draft legislation would be provided to agencies of that Council for their consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 20 August 1992, Mrs Kelly issued a press statement on the release of the revised ESAC document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A National Approach to Endangered Species</EMPHASIS>. Mention was made at ANZECC to develop and report within one year on a national approach for the protection of vulnerable and endangered species. But no mention was made of any draft legislation. Let me remind honourable senators of that date&mdash;20 August 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 11 September 1992 the Northern Territory Conservation Commission contacted the secretary of ANZECC, advising him of the omission from the draft summary record of ANZECC of Mrs Kelly's commitment to consult with the States and Territories with regard to the proposed legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next date on which the Northern Territory Government, through its Conservation Commission, became involved was on 18 September 1992 when, through the agency of the Northern Territory Chamber of Mines&mdash;an independent, industry-based organisation&mdash;it was contacted and asked whether it knew anything about the endangered species legislation to be tabled in the Federal Parliament. No ANZECC agencies had received the promised draft legislation at that date. I think, quite rightly, at that point the Northern Territory Government assumed that what the Chamber of Mines was talking about was not a government Bill but perhaps Senator Coulter's other threatened species legislation that had also been mooted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 21 September 1992, the Northern Territory Conservation Minister received an unofficial copy of version 1 of the Bill from the Northern Territory Chamber of Mines, and was advised that the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy had also received an unofficial copy through AMIC. They were advised that the copies were very definitely unofficial, in draft, marked `in confidence' and that they had not, of course, been released by DASET. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next day, on 22 September 1992, the Northern Territory Minister, Mr Reed, received a letter dated 18 September from Mrs Kelly's office advising that there would be a confidential briefing on the draft Commonwealth Bill on endangered species at Parliament House, Canberra, on Monday, 28 September. At that stage the Northern Territory Government had not received an official copy of the Bill, and nor had any other ANZECC agency. The matter was also being taken up about this time in the national press, emphasising the concerns of industries and that copies of the Bill had been leaked&mdash;it would be very interesting to know by whom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next day, on 23 September 1992, the Conservation Commission in the Northern Territory received a fax from Queensland quoting part of the draft record of the 13 August ESAC meeting, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommended against the release of the draft bill for public review if this was to prevent its passage in the current session. However if the bill was distributed for outside scrutiny, the Committee recommended that ESAC be included in this process. </PARA>
<PARA>Following this, Mr Reed, sent a letter to Mrs Kelly advising that Professor David Wigston would represent the Northern Territory at the briefing, listing a number of questions and concerns over the draft but certainly indicating that much more time was needed for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 25 September, the Minister's office received by courier mail from DASET a copy of the draft Bill&mdash;version 1 turns up.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 28 September, three State and Territory representatives met at Parliament House, including the Northern Territory&mdash;coordinated, of course, by Professor David Wigston; New South Wales, which had also received its copy of the draft on 25 September; and Tasmania, which had not received a copy of the Bill from DASET but was in possession of an unofficial copy. At the briefing, two other representatives were also present:  one from Queensland, who had not received the official copy but had his unofficial copy, and one from the ACT, who had received his official copy that morning&mdash;28 September. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 October, having received a detailed report on the briefing session, Mr Reed telephoned Mrs Kelly and expressed his concerns over both the content of the draft Bill and the clandestine process for consideration.

This letter was copied to all of the State and Territory Ministers and a telephone conference was suggested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 13 October, Mr Reed's office received a letter from DASET advising that the Bill was being redrafted and inviting the Minister or representatives to attend another briefing at Parliament House on the evening of 15 October. On 15 October, Mr Reed met with Mrs Kelly and received her assurance that the draft Bill&mdash;now, of course, version 3&mdash;would be presented to ANZECC agencies for discussion on 6 November. There were more briefings. The agencies were assured that they would receive their final version 3 copy of the Bill for consideration and that it would be discussed on 6 November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 28 October a conversation took place to find out whether a copy of version 3 was yet officially available and DASET promised to reply.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to delay the Senate too long, but I cannot allow an article in the most recent issue of Sydney's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph </EMPHASIS>to go unanswered. The article, an apparently regular feature on family law, is written by one Peter Dowding, partner with Briggs Dowding, who bill themselves as family law specialists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Honourable senators may recall that Peter Dowding had a somewhat unsuccessful career as a one-time Western Australia State Premier. He has now returned to a more profitable field, it appears. Given, he says, that his practice is one that specialises in family law&mdash;a very lucrative practice&mdash;one could also suggest that therefore he would have a vested interest in ensuring the status quo. I take somewhat with a grain of salt his article headed `A long wait for very little', which purports to comment on the family law report which was tabled last week. He claims that the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act suffers from the `Canberra syndrome'&mdash;that we have called for more complex regulations and more Acts of parliament that will lead to a massive escalation in the cost of litigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only suggest that perhaps Mr Dowding is trying to pre-empt a case for increasing his own fees or that he has not read the report very carefully. At length in the report in my own comments and in submissions, members of the Committee have dealt strongly with the at times outrageous costs of family law litigation. Perhaps in my remarks last week I did not make myself quite clear enough when I said that the legal profession needed to take a long hard look at its fee structure. Perhaps I should also have been a little more direct, and I will be more direct now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are solicitors specialising in family law who have made a very lucrative business out of lengthy and expensive litigation, invariably not in the clients' best interest. It is time that the whole system was simplified, cleaned up and the cost and pain minimised&mdash;and that is precisely and concisely what the report suggests should happen. I am not for one moment suggesting that Mr Dowding is a solicitor such as I have just described. Far be it from me to suggest that I know more about family law than he. After all, it is now his professional career. He has also had considerable experience in the court, which is something that I have not had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am suggesting that obviously Mr Dowding has not read past the first page of the report. Indeed, we have a total of 120 recommendations, but Mr Dowding has ignored all but one&mdash;and, strangely, that is the very first. Admittedly, it is a purely administrative recommendation but, nevertheless, quite important and quite undeserving of the cynical criticism levelled by Mr Dowding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite appalled at the lack of depth of treatment Mr Dowding has given the report and I can only assume&mdash;indeed, I can only hope that he is so busy in his family law practice that he did not have sufficient time and concentration to write an article worthy of better comment. I would hate to think he would take any client of his into court as ill-prepared and ill-informed about their case as he appears to be in commenting on this parliamentary report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, you were a part of that report. The Committee had before it 1,031 submissions; we had 112 witnesses half of whom were private individuals. The 120 recommendations were made by an all party Committee comprising members from both Houses of this Parliament. Its report was unanimous, except for two or three small items by Senator Spindler. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do agree with Mr Dowding when he says in his article that the Child Support Agency is an organisation that in his view cries out for an early inquiry. Basically, that is what we have said in our report. But even on that issue he did not really give us as big a compliment as he could have. I believe that people who write articles in papers, especially if they are in a business and writing on behalf of that business, should look to the facts, look a little bit behind the report, look into it a lot more deeply and look at some of the submissions we received. I believe that Senator McKiernan led the Committee in such a way that we gave a good balanced report. I believe that Mr Peter Dowding, ex-Premier, stands condemned for his article in the paper. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to keep the Senate long tonight in speaking on the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS> of 29 November which has just been addressed by Senator Brownhill. I was very disappointed this morning to read the article in question. I have not made a point of following Mr Dowding's articles on this particular topic which have been occurring for quite a period of time; I gave it up pretty early in the piece. I think Peter Dowding has a reputation for not paying attention to detail, and certainly in this article he has not done so again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have a problem at all with people criticising the report that was brought down in this place last Tuesday. As a matter of fact, we welcome criticism because the report is out there for people to scrutinise. But before people enter into print with criticisms, surely they should at least read what they have in front of them. It is quite obvious and quite apparent that Mr Dowding did not read the report before he put pen to paper to write this article. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, I do not have a problem with criticism of our report. But the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS> is a widely circulated newspaper and people will read Mr Dowding's article because they are interested in the topic of family law. I believe that Peter Dowding, in putting forward an article like this, has done a disservice to himself and to his legal practice, and also to the newspaper's readers. People will get distorted ideas of what is contained in our report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this is a report that will stand on its own. I will not seek to defend it here. It will be defended by others in other places in time. If even some of the recommendations that we put forward are implemented by a government at some time in the future, I think our committee work over a period of 20 months will have been worthwhile and fruitful. I regret that Peter, an ex-Premier of Western Australia, an ex-Labor Party parliamentarian, has stooped to these depths. I do not know the reason, but it is unfortunate that sometimes upon retirement from parliament politicians go the way that they do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention another individual who has done the Committee somewhat of a disservice as well. On 10 October last year in an adjournment speech I mentioned an article that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on 7 October by one Mr Ian Monk. The article was headed, `Whitewash feared from family law inquiry'.   Mr Monk made those comments</PARA>
<PARA>over 13 months ago. He has done exactly the same thing again. He reached his conclusions in October last year. That was little better than Mr Dowding. Mr Dowding waited until the report came out. But Mr Monk reached his conclusions 13 months ago, before the Committee had embarked upon its public inquiry, and on Tuesday of last week, the day after the report was presented to the Parliament, issued a press statement which read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please be advised of the anticipated release in Federal Parliament of the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Family Law Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Ian Monk of Sydney, whose reform campaign was instrumental in the establishment of this far reaching and potentially controversial inquiry, will be available for comment following the report's tabling.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He can be contacted on Monday 23 November and Tuesday 24 November. . . </PARA>
<PARA>at a hotel here in Canberra. Some gullible members of the media have taken up Mr Monk's suggestion, and one television station put him to air. He too had not read the report. I think I speak on behalf of all members of the Committee, a joint, all-party representative committee, in saying that we would all welcome criticism, but at least let it be informed criticism. People should read the thing. It is 450 pages long and it is available at government bookshops. People should read it, and then if they do not agree with it inform somebody. But they should at least do us the justice of informing themselves rather than making mugs of themselves as Mr Dowding and Mr Monk have done in recent days. </PARA>
