<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I note that, while Senator Vallentine gave notice of her intention to resign, the Western Australian Parliament was sitting at the relevant time and, therefore, could not make a further appointment. Nonetheless, the Western Australian Government has failed to make the appointment of Christabel Chamarette, who has been duly nominated by the party that had formerly nominated Senator Jo Vallentine. There are other mechanisms which are available to the Western Australian Government for the filling of that casual vacancy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am personally rather dismayed that the Western Australian Government should essentially be thumbing its nose at this chamber. This chamber is comprised of 76 senators, not 75 senators. It requires the representation of senators from every State and this Senate is, therefore, deficient at the present time as a consequence of the Western Australian Government failing to make the proper appointment of a person who has been duly recommended by the party which obtained the necessary votes at the previous election&mdash;the one which elected Jo Vallentine. I will be giving notice of a motion later that this Senate should condemn the Government of Western Australia for failing to carry through with the appointment of a replacement senator. </PARA>

I would remind members of the Government that at the same time, in 1970, Senator Murphy was also very outspoken in his criticism of the Government of New South Wales over its failure to appoint a replacement senator at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>

They represent the culmination of 12 months work by the Sound and Vision Office of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and sound engineering consultants, assisted by the Joint House Department, to improve the quality of the chamber's sound reinforcement system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new system encompasses both the new loudspeakers as well as new microphones. The whole system has been exhaustively tested during the summer adjournment and today will be its first test under working conditions. The microphones are considerably more effective. However, I am advised that speech notes or other papers held in front of the microphones will noticeably reduce the quality of the sound output, and I suggest to honourable senators that they be conscious of this while becoming familiar with the new system.</PARA>

I ask that honourable senators bear with the sound engineers during this time. Any comments honourable senators may have on the level and quality of speech reinforcement will greatly assist the engineers with this fine-tuning. Such comments should be made to the Usher of the Black Rod, who will compile a report to the engineers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer the Minister to yesterday's report by Access Economics that the Commonwealth Budget this year is expected to blow out dramatically to a $9 billion deficit and that the net public sector financing requirement is forecast to increase to about $17 1/2 billion. Does the Minister agree with these forecasts?  If not, what are the Treasury's forecasts?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I always anticipate a question about the size of the deficit from the members of the Opposition because, after all, they are experts at it. They left us the largest deficit in the history of this country and lied about it. I further say to Senator Short that the Government's forecasts will be available tomorrow night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the  Government's view, there is a need and scope for the fiscal stimulus which the Government intends to provide. Fiscal stimulus will directly add to demand in the short run and get the economy moving again. Commentators and sections of the business community have almost unanimously called for such a stimulus and few of them are wedded, I suspect, to an ideology of excessive fiscal caution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point to Senator Short that the OECD <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economic Outlook</EMPHASIS> recently noted the sustainability of Australia's fiscal position in maintaining its public sector debt to GDP ratio. As I hinted earlier, our Budget surpluses have earned us the ability to make tomorrow's statement and that statement will, of course, include some forecasts which Senator Short is now seeking that I make. If he waits until tomorrow, he will get the answer.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I note the Minister's answer and, in so doing, I point out to him that Access Economics has a far better track record on forecasting over recent years than has the Treasury. I also note the confirmation in the Minister's answer that tomorrow night's package will be stimulatory in the sense of further increasing the Budget deficit and that there will therefore be a very significant public sector deficit this year. If the deficit is being funded by increased sales of government bonds, what is the impact of that demand for funds on domestic interest rates and on inflation? If it is going to be funded by overseas borrowings rather than government borrowings, what will the impact be on the exchange rate and our foreign debt?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Shipping and Aviation. I draw the Minister's attention to the importance of the Australian tourism industry, which presently employs 450,000 people, or 5.8 per cent of the Australian work force and is the largest export earner in this country. What steps has the Government taken to recognise the importance of the tourism industry to the Australian economy?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="11" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="SHIPPING AND AVIATION" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Tourism, Mr Griffiths, has provided me with the following information. As all honourable senators would know, the Australian tourism industry is now Australia's largest export earner, contributing in excess of $7 billion&mdash;I think it is $7.3 billion&mdash;in the last financial year to our export earning growth. This is fully 10 per cent of Australia's total export earnings. It is now beating coal, wool or wheat in terms of our export earnings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, as we also all know, it is a great industry for creating employment. I do not think there is an industry better than the service industry at investing dollars in infrastructure. In excess of 450,000 people are employed in the tourism industry. It is anticipated that between 12 and 16 per cent of all new jobs in the 1990s in Australia will be created in the tourism and hospitality sectors of our economy. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has recently acknowledged, in a very substantial way, the status of tourism as an industry with the creation of a separate department of tourism and, of course, the elevation of the portfolio of tourism to the Cabinet. Even before this, however, the Government recognised the potential of the tourism industry. Under this Government there has been a sixfold increase in funds available for tourism promotion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1990 the Government allocated an additional $22.6m to the Australian Tourist Commission to enable it to carry out a worldwide television campaign promoting Australia as a tourist destination. This campaign has paid significant dividends. Tourism in Australia increased by 7 per cent in the first 11 months of last year. In key target markets the growth has been even more pronounced: a 10 per cent increase from the United States, an 18 per cent increase from New Zealand and a 9 per cent increase from Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since his appointment, in the lead-up to this week's statement, the Minister for Tourism has been consulting widely with the tourism industry to determine the priorities of the industry for reform. It is essential that we create the type of environment in which the tourism industry can flourish. It has the potential to respond rapidly to additional stimulus and, therefore, lead to greater foreign exchange earnings and job growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the 1990s, the tourism industry is expected to create 200,000 additional jobs. The major threat to this job growth, of course, as I have said in the Senate many times, would be the imposition of a goods and services tax: it would kill the industry. In conclusion, in addition to the points that I have already made, there will be some positive news in the aviation sector tomorrow night. Aviation is the engine which successfully drives the growth of tourism in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said in answer to Senator Short a minute or two ago, the stabilisation of Australia's foreign debt&mdash;which has been talked about for many years&mdash;will be one of the major results of the continuing economic reform program to make Australia more outward looking and internationally competitive. Over the last 3 years the net foreign debt ratio has been stable at around 34 per cent to 35 per cent of GDP. Most of the net overseas debt is owed by the private sector, particularly consequent upon the behaviour of the 1980s. As of 30 September 1991, 68 per cent of the debt was owed by the private sector; the State governments owed 17 per cent; and public enterprises, financial and trading enterprises, owed 20 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last year the increase in net overseas debt was much less than in previous years. The debt servicing burden actually fell, with interest payments on the net debt in 1990-91 equivalent to 19.6 per cent of the value of the export of goods and services, compared with 21.4 per cent in the previous year. We have to continue to make progress on that issue, which I think we are doing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The producers of the film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Turtle Beach</EMPHASIS> have advised my Department that it will be released in Australia on 19 March and in the United States the following day. A number of preview showings have already occurred, generating quite a deal of newspaper discussion. I have seen a preview print of the film, as have a number of officers of my Department. I want to make clear on behalf of the Australian Government our understanding that the film is manifestly a work of fiction. It is not and does not purport to be a documentary account of historical events in Malaysia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Although the film is a fictional drama, it is set in Malaysia during a particular, identified historical period&mdash;for the most part in the late 1970s, at the time when substantial numbers of Indo-Chinese boat people began arriving in that country. This could leave an uncritical viewer with the impression that the major events depicted in it had actually occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as a number of published commentaries on the film have already acknowledged, the film's depiction of extreme violence against boat people, its portrayals of Malaysian official attitudes and actions with respect to the refugees, and its presentation of aspects of Malaysian life and cultural values are&mdash;whatever their claims to artistic justification&mdash;simply not accurate historical representations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The film was produced by an Australian company which received part funding for the project from the Australian Film Finance Corporation, an independent publicly funded company which provides finance on commercial criteria to assist Australian film makers. The film was produced with the intention of commercial sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government cannot and does not seek to control either media reports or fictional portrayals of this kind in this country. The Government has acknowledged, however, that there will be times when inaccurate or distorted reports or fictional portrayals are of such a kind that it is proper for governments to dissociate themselves from them. In the Government's judgment, the release of the film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Turtle Beach</EMPHASIS> is such an occasion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Does the Minister remember giving an answer to an earlier question of mine in which he said that no Government money would be expended on the MFP and that the total project would be driven by private investment? How much money has the Government already spent on the MFP? Is the Minister aware of the report of a recent high level Japanese economic delegation which has essentially said that the MFP is not a viable development without a great deal of prior Government expenditure?  Will the Government spend more money on the MFP which, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> said this morning, is driven by `a combination of political opportunism and the pervasive influence of the consultancy industry' to support foreign industry rather than spend what little resources are available on support for industries of a home grown variety?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly do not recall saying that no Government money will be given to the MFP for the simple reason that last year in the Budget we did give money to it, and I think the year before as well. That has always been made clear. But in terms of investment in the MFP, that has to be private sector led. That has always been the Government's position and in respect of anything which the South Australian Government may wish to do in relation to the site, that is predominantly a matter for it under programs of the Commonwealth and State governments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Communications. It refers to the decision of Telecom to buy 11,000 tonnes of directory paper from Finland, thus turning its back on APPM in favour of the short term gain which a currency devalued spot market offers. Is it a fact that under the Australian Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Act the Minister has power, after consultation with the board of Telecom, to give it such written instructions as appear to the Minister to be necessary in the public interest? Is it not a fact that it is  detrimental to the public interest for many workers to lose their jobs in an area of high unemployment, for company tax and income tax revenue to fall and for Australia's trade balance on forest based products, already unacceptably high, to go even higher? Will the Minister therefore instruct AOTC to reverse its decision and to remind it that the Australian community and Australian taxpayers have been very generous to it by waiving the $1 billion merger fee and converting from debt to equity a sum of $2 billion?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine should be aware that the basic instruction from the Government to AOTC is to act commercially. That has to be the basis of any business operation of that kind, particularly one that is to be opened up to competition. It should be noted that this decision was taken by Telecom late last year prior to the merger with OTC on 1 February. I have inquired into the details of the calling of tenders and I am satisfied that a proper tender process was entered into. It is now a matter of regret that APPM has said a number of people may lose their jobs as a result of the decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of price, there is no question that the correct decision was taken. There is also no question that APPM has been consulted by Telecom about price a number of times over the last couple of years. However, I am disappointed in the method of communicating the eventual decisions to APPM, and I am always concerned when any Australian loses his or her job because of the purchase from overseas of something such as paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a talk to APPM and there has been one further conversation between APPM and AOTC. I intend to pursue that matter over the next week or so to see whether anything can be done to save those jobs. It may well be, for example, that some extra stock can be bought. I know that Telecom is presently looking at those possibilities. I shall keep Senator Harradine and the Senate informed on those deliberations over the next few days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a matter of general principle, while I am prepared to give policy directions, I am not certain that it will be a very good precedent for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>Ministers to give instructions to bodies such as AOTC on individual management decisions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From one point of view, the announcement by President de Klerk that a whites only referendum will be held on 17 March to determine the future of the political reform process is very unfortunate. Given the progress so far towards the dismantling of apartheid, one might have hoped that the days of white South Africans alone determining the future of their country were over. In this context, the negative reaction of the ANC to the referendum is perfectly understandable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is, however, a little more complicated than that. President de Klerk's decision to seek a fresh mandate for reform from whites must obviously be seen in the context of the very emotional reaction to the reform process still evident in significant sections of the white community, reflected most recently, of course, in the outcome of the Potchefstroom by-election. While there is every reason to believe that cooler heads will prevail if white South Africans are confronted with a stark choice between going forward or going backwards, it is understandable, against the background of Potchefstroom, that the National Party Government should have felt the need to take some dramatic action to stop emotional anti-reform momentum from further developing. Certainly the question being put to the white community in South Africa is very stark in its simplicity. As announced last night, it is in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you support continuation of the reform process which the State President began on 2 February 1990 and which is aimed at a new Constitution through negotiations?</PARA>
<PARA>This does present the white electorate with a very simple choice: to continue into the future with its mixture of hopes and uncertainties or to retreat into the past, which, particularly in the light of the expectations for change which have obviously been generated since February 1990, would be a sure recipe for an absolute maelstrom of disaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I am sure that all senators will join me in hoping that the outcome of the referendum is positive, as most preliminary opinion analysis in fact suggests it will be. If it is, the referendum may in fact prove to be a major milestone on the road to a new democratic South Africa, with the potential not only to give new momentum to the reform process as far as the white community is concerned but also perhaps to speed it up, if it is accepted following the referendum that there is no need for any further reference to racially defined electorates in endorsing the constitution now in the process of negotiation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the reported criticisms of Messrs Rattigan and Carmichael in the press, although I have not seen yet the full text of their submission to the Industry Commission, which is the subject of those reports. But from the reports it appears that they have three criticisms interrelated, which have been picked up in Senator Spindler's question: first, that the Federal Government is not supporting industry efforts to become more competitive and is robbing Australia of the economic benefits of structural adjustment; secondly, that we are too committed to pursuing only trade reform on agriculture and defending the trade policy status quo; and thirdly, that not sufficient emphasis or focus is being given by the Government to domestic policy practices elsewhere which distort world trade. That may be an unfair summary of the full paper but that is the way it has been reported.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's response to each of these criticisms&mdash;and this will answer Senator Spindler&mdash;is as follows: strong support is being provided by the Federal Government to efforts by Australian industry to become more competitive through the Uruguay Round negotiations. The Round fundamentally is about international competitiveness, about creating an environment in which Australian industry, like industry internationally generally, can flourish without the kinds of distortions and impediments of all kinds which litter the landscape at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Uruguay Round is about not only reductions in tariff barriers but also about the whole range of non-tariff barriers as well as subsidies and things such as that which are inhibiting trade at the moment. To suggest that there is something one dimensional about the Uruguay Round itself is to misread&mdash;if that is, indeed, what is being said by these two gentlemen&mdash;the nature of the enterprise on which we are all embarked. Moreover, it addresses new areas such as services and intellectual property, which are also themselves extremely important in advancing Australian economic interests. Australian industry will be able to benefit really across the board from the more liberal trading environment that we do hope, and to some extent still expect, will follow the conclusion of the present negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the alleged overemphasis on agriculture, it is, of course, the case that agriculture remains extremely important for Australia and the Uruguay Round, addressing this for the first time in GATT history, does hold the promise of delivering more substantive benefits than any previous multilateral negotiation. But we are not only focusing on agriculture. It just happens to be that that is where we have had the highest profile because of our initiation and leadership of the Cairns Group. We have been very active participants in all other areas of those negotiations, especially services trade and intellectual property, which I have already mentioned, where we do stand to be major beneficiaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, again I would respond negatively to the criticism about not pressing for a focus internationally on the impact that domestic industry policy can have. As part of the interim results of the Uruguay Round in 1989, the GATT established a trade policy review mechanism which was designed to keep the internal policies of GATT participants under regular review. We, in fact, exposed ourselves to that process as an early candidate for review in order to give a momentum to it&mdash;a demonstration effect. We believe that that is exactly the kind of thing that these negotiations and the machinery associated with them should be trying to put focus on. That mechanism, together with the anticipated outcome from the substantive negotiations themselves, will certainly continue to give a very strong international focus to the impact that domestic policies can have on world trade.</PARA>

I refer to the 56 boat people who landed undetected on the northern coast of Western Australia in January and who walked inland for several days before they were found. What is the Government's explanation for this serious lapse of Australia's coastal surveillance? Secondly, what is the Government's explanation for this serious undermining of the integrity of Australia's immigration program? Where are these persons now?  Have any made applications for refugee status? How long will it take for the applications to be determined? Finally, is it true that since November 1989, a little over two years ago, eight boats have landed on Australia's northern coasts carrying 382 illegal immigrants and, of these, only 19 have since left Australia? Why has the Government in this whole matter been so indecisive and why has there been so much delay?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an excellent question. Senator Sherry takes an astute interest in these matters, which is more than I can say for some of the honourable senators opposite who are interjecting. In fact, I am aware of two editorials in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. I am sad that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, in pursuit of an article which appeared in that paper a week or so ago, has let its normally excellent editorial standards slip. The editorial is based on the draft report from the Industry Commission relating to the national procurement development program which recommends that the scheme not be extended beyond June 1992&mdash;something the Government will have to examine when it gets a final report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the Commission, and now the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, has come to this view in spite of a passage in the summary of the Industry Commission's report which says that, `It is not possible to reach a view on whether the program is effective in enhancing the international competitiveness of recipient firms'. The Industry Commission said that it is not possible to reach a view about that issue, but then it went on to say that it was against it in any event. Having reached a non-conclusion on this matter, the Commission then sought to justify its report by debating whether government intervention is justified at all in achieving economic and social benefits by supporting the development and commercialisation of technology. That is a legitimate debate which takes place within Australia and within the Liberal Party and in all public forums.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point, however, that the scheme was established following Sir Brian Inglis's inquiry into the government purchasing of technological equipment. In that report, which was commissioned and discussed by the Government and discussed in the Senate, the point was made that there was a lack of opportunity for Australian companies to commercialise technological products and services in domestic and international markets. The Inglis report, consistent with the views of the world of Michael Porter of Harvard, concluded at the time that there is a critical role for government agencies in contributing to industry development by encouraging government agencies to work with Australian companies in areas typically dominated by large overseas suppliers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme was about helping to change the culture of government procurement agencies. I profoundly believe&mdash;and I believe that most or all of my colleagues do too&mdash;that that is something which has to happen. Those who do not believe that are wallowing in a sea of ignorance. Indeed, there are many questions from Opposition senators from time to time along the lines of `Why does not this government agency support this government business?' and things of that kind. That is what the scheme was essentially about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a draft report. In so far as the report makes comments about program administration, these and the major issue will be addressed when we receive the final report.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the American practice of positive reporting, whereby dossiers can be compiled informing the holders of that dossier of the whole credit history of a particular person, is obnoxious to the idea of fair play in Australia.

That law comes into effect today and, as a result, such information cannot be passed to real estate agents, insurance agents, potential employers and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is, also, that it is most important that those credit files that are held are accurate, and that when people apply for credit they are not denied that credit because of an inaccurate history that has been compiled by a previous credit provider. To that extent, once again, Australians will be able to have guaranteed access to their credit files held by the Credit Reference Association of Australia, free of charge, for scrutiny, and if there is anything to be corrected in those credit records then it is to be corrected very promptly.

<PARA>Ian Wood, who was known to me personally in my earlier days in the Senate, was born on 31 January 1901 in Mackay, Queensland. He was a remarkable gentleman in many ways and devoted over 50 years of his life to public service in both local and Federal government. If I may be permitted a personal observation, Ian Wood was very much a Mackay man&mdash;in the Menzies phrase, Mackay to his bootstraps. Even after he retired from the Senate, those of us who visited Mackay would see him around the place. I think he was still taking an interest in local government issues and still riding his bike. He was very much a person who was profoundly committed to his local community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ian Wood's career in government began in his late twenties when he became an alderman. He then went on to become Mayor of Mackay and purported to be the youngest mayor in Australia at that time. He was elected Mayor of Mackay no fewer than five times and served for 15 years in that capacity. Other achievements in the area of local government included his being President of the Australian Council of Local Government and President of the Queensland Local Government Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His election in 1949 as a Liberal senator for Queensland began a career in Federal politics which was to last almost 29 years until his retirement in 1978. During that time he served on a number of committees, the most notable being his chairmanship of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. People such as Senator Durack and I remember that Ian chaired that Committee for over 20 years. His enormous contribution to the Committee remains a feature of his time in Federal Parliament. He also served as Temporary Chairman of Committees for some 25 years and acted as President of the Senate on several occasions in the unavoidable absence of the elected President. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ian Wood will be remembered as a hard working and principled man who worked unstintingly for the people of his home State of Queensland and, of course, Mackay, as I said earlier, and the people of Australia. He had a capacity to talk with people at all levels, and his obvious honesty and integrity made him a popular choice. His re-election at every poll until his retirement was evidence of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say from my personal observations that Ian Wood was not a person without eccentric qualities. His time in this place was not always smooth sailing. He was known for his independence and outspokenness. He and Senator Wright were sort of a double in respect of much of that. I am sure that he caused his Party colleagues more than a few anxious moments as a result. Nevertheless, he pursued what he believed to be right and was a great and worthy representative of the State of Queensland. In his last speech to the Senate, Ian Wood said:</PARA>

Ian Wood left school at the age of 12 and, despite his lack of formal education, became a successful businessman in Mackay. As has been said, in 1949 he was elected to the Senate where he served for in excess of 28 years until his retirement in 1978.

These days it might simply be said that he was health conscious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speaking to one of Ian Wood's colleagues, former South Australian Senator Gordon Davidson, who was a close friend and colleague, he told me of the commitment of former Senator Wood to this institution, particularly his priority to the Senate as a States House.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout Ian Wood's time in the Senate he was a strong supporter of the examination of legislation by Senate committees. One of his great contributions to the role of the Senate within the parliamentary system was as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. I understand that he presided over its deliberations for an astonishing period of 25 years. His commitment has been put to me in terms of his fierce defence of the Committee's terms of reference and, in particular, the matters of safeguarding the freedom of the individual and the prevention of additional costs to the taxpayer. Despite the fact that his Party was in government during the period of his chairmanship, he never spared Ministers or the departments as he presided over the Committee's deliberations. Senator Wood was also Temporary Chairman of Committees for eight years from 1958 to 1966. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ian Wood made no apology for the fact that one of his most significant areas of interest was the development of the tourist industry in north Queensland, particularly Mackay. He was a proud citizen of Mackay and I understand was generous to those of his colleagues who visited him there. His list of services to the city is legion, including 15 years as mayor, so it is not surprising that the citation for his Order of Australia award was for services to the State of Queensland. </PARA>

He was a very generous benefactor both to the city and to organisations within that city. </PARA>

He knew what was going on because he actively talked to people at all levels of society. He used to call it his political nous, but in reality it was his willingness and his ability to talk to people in all strata of society that gave him a good feeling as to where community interests lay. He would never follow polls, in the way so many inhabitants of this and the other chamber do, before coming to an opinion on what people were thinking or deciding what he should do. </PARA>

Probably for that reason he never became a Minister, although he had the ability to become a Minister.

As was mentioned earlier, he was renowned in Mackay for shunning the use of motor vehicles and using a bicycle instead. I recall that, during the period when a sales tax Bill was stalled in the Senate, Ian Wood was asked on television what he would do if sales tax on bicycles were increased. The interviewer was obviously trying to embarrass Ian Wood but I recall that his reply was such that the interviewer himself was embarrassed.

It is not inappropriate at this time of honouring this great Queenslander to raise the issue of unity of the progressive forces that are so essential to lead this nation into the next century. I again raise with my friends and colleagues in the National Party in Queensland the question which Ian Wood considered in his day of having the Country Party join the Liberal Party as the unified non-Labor party in Australia, for the good of all Australians and for the good of Australia as a whole. </PARA>

I speak today as the present Chair of the Committee, with a mere six years of membership of the Committee behind me but with a deep consciousness of the tradition established by Senator Wood. Senator Wood made a tremendous contribution to the present reputation of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, and not only a national reputation but also, as has  already  been  said,  an  international reputation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the safeguards which the Australian people now enjoy and take for granted were initiated by the Committee under his leadership, and were only established against opposition from those whose commitment to these freedoms was less than that of Senator Wood. It is a tribute to Senator Wood that a person who left school at 12, as he did, to go to work to help his mother support the household, should play such an important role in the content and form of Commonwealth legislation. It is also a tribute to the Senate as an institution that he should be able to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Hill has described, Senator Wood was particularly concerned that delegated legislation did not breach personal rights and liberties. I will briefly describe his considerable contribution in this area. Instruments of delegated legislation often include offence provisions, the penalties for breach of which are no less real than penalties imposed by Acts. Under Senator Wood the Committee ensured that offence provisions contained appropriate safeguards for those affected. Many instruments which came before the Committee were defective in relation to such safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one case, individuals were required to give to an inspector such information as they possessed about an offence or a suspected offence. This was a violation of normal standards of personal freedom. A person is generally not required to give such information to anyone, even if arrested. Another instrument provided that the prosecution could amend its statement alleging an offence without giving the accused an opportunity to prepare to meet the new charge. Another replaced objective defences to a prosecution, which could be argued before an independent court, with the subjective opinion of a public official. All these provisions were the subject of caustic comment by Ian Wood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today it is commonplace that all important discretions vested in public officials, whether Ministers, statutory officers or public servants, should be subject to independent, external review of the merits of each exercise of the power. Present delegated legislation, due largely to the efforts of the Committee during Senator Wood's time, now usually provides for such review, normally to a specialist body such as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This ensures that individual rights and liberties are not subject to arbitrary or improper interference, however remote that possibility may be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, things were considerably different when Senator Wood was on the Committee. There were many examples of wide discretions not subject to review. With Senator Wood as Chair, these deficiencies were exposed. In one case, regulations totally prohibited an important area of economic activity unless the Minister granted a licence. These licences could be subject to conditions which could be varied or added to at any time and which could, and did, relate to matters occurring both before and years after the initial transaction. There were no criteria to guide the Minister in the exercise of the power which could be different for, and discriminate against, individuals in the same position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister could revoke a licence at any time. A licensing officer who was not the Minister could demand any sum of money that he or she thought fit as security for compliance with the conditions. The Minister could delegate his or her powers&mdash;there were not many women Ministers in those days. There was no provision for review of any decision and access to the ordinary courts was denied, apparently even where the Minister refused to consider an application or where there was unjust treatment or delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another case there was no legal redress from a decision by an official which, effectively, resulted in a confiscation of property. Other instruments provided for people to be taken into custody and detained with no proper safeguards. There were many similar cases, usually with no provision for a right to be heard, no right of review and no redress to the ordinary courts unless an official acted wholly unreasonably or from corrupt or improper motives. Ian Wood took active steps to correct all these defects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I remind the Senate of one of the best known deficiencies revealed by the Committee under Senator Wood. There was a Telecom by-law which had the admirable purpose of dealing with hoax calls to emergency services, but the unintended result of the actual drafting was to make it an offence to tell a lie over the telephone. There may have been times in the past when, in responding to an unwelcome invitation over the telephone, I, like countless other people, have been guilty of a small deception. Senator Wood's vigilance saved many of us from breaching Commonwealth law. </PARA>

After one such session&mdash;not with the Parliamentary Draftsman&mdash;the Committee suggested that the Senate may wish to conduct an inquiry into the administration of individual sections of a particular department.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also express my regret at the death of former senator Ian Wood. As a new member in this chamber in 1987, I was appointed to the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. I served on the Scrutiny of Bills Committee for my first parliamentary term; I am still a member of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. One could not be a member of that Committee and not learn of the work of Senator Ian Wood. In fact, his name is one that I have heard more often than any other in my five years in this chamber. When I go to schools to talk about the role of the Senate and especially about the scrutiny of legislation, I talk about the importance of separating out one's role as a parliamentarian and one's role as a politician.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we have heard Senator Ian Wood described as a maverick and other such things. I would describe him, from the illustrations I have been given around this place, as an example of a parliamentarian, a person who could take off his political hat and put on his parliamentary hat in making the decisions that were made in regulations and ordinances in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate the great contribution made by Senator Wood to Commonwealth legislation. That contribution has resulted in a permanent and beneficial improvement to personal rights and liberties and to parliamentary propriety. I do not think that was gained lightly or easily. Those on the other side of the chamber who have chaired the Regulations and Ordinances Committee will know that one does not win many pixie points for going to one's own Minister and telling him that subordinate legislation is not acceptable in the eyes of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ian Wood and Senator Messner played a very important part in establishing the strength of that Committee. One of its former secretaries describes very clearly the role that both those people played, but in particular Senator Wood, in the development of the Committee. During his chairmanship, Senator Wood crossed the floor a number of times to ensure that the Committee's recommendations were adhered to. In fact, he established and set in concrete the tradition that when the Regulations and Ordinances Committee moves for disallowance of a regulation it almost always goes unquestioned in the Senate and the Committee wins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As people have said, that Committee has been recognised overseas. When Senator Giles, Senator Crowley, Senator Bishop and I attended the last Commonwealth conference on delegated legislation, it was obvious that Australia was leading the Westminster world in the scrutiny of legislation and delegated legislation. That is in no small part due to the very significant influence Ian Wood had on that Committee and its role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall give a couple of short examples of his concerns about parliamentary propriety. The very first report made by Senator Wood as Chairman drew attention to the considerable danger for parliamentary propriety of what is often called quasi-legislation. The report described an increasing tendency for Acts to provide for legislative instruments that are subject to neither tabling nor disallowance. Such instruments are really not quasi-legislation but legislation properly so-called. In recent years, there has been a general effort to formalise such instruments and bring them within parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Important developments in this area were the establishment of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee in 1982 and the Administrative Review Council interim report last year on rule making by Commonwealth agencies. This is now much less of a problem than it was. However, it should be acknowledged that Senator Wood identified this danger almost 40 years ago. Indeed, the Committee at that time suggested the same course as the ARC now recommends, which is a statement of criteria to determine which instruments should be subject to tabling and disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of parliamentary propriety that concerned Senator Wood was the tendency for delegated legislation to express policy rather than administrative detail. The Committee was particularly vigilant to ensure that regulations should not deal with substantive legislation. This is also a matter that has now been addressed by the ARC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the practices and procedures established under Senator Wood continue to the present as undertakings under which the Regulations and Ordinances Committee still operates. For instance, it is a breach of parliamentary propriety if delegated legislation is not in accordance with the parent Act. Under Senator Wood, the Committee decided that this would not be interpreted in a narrow, legalistic fashion to mean merely that an instrument was valid. Rather, the Committee adopted the view that an instrument may be valid but still breach its principles because of an unusual or unexpected use of the powers conferred by the Act. The Committee sensibly acknowledged that legal validity is a subject on which opinions differ and which can finally be decided only by a court. Therefore, decades later the Committee is still using the standards first established during Senator Wood's stewardship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with great interest that I note that the two senators who contributed most to the development of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee have been Liberal senators, a tradition they have set that I hope will be followed by honourable senators on both sides of this chamber. I know, as a member of that Committee, that the tradition they set of enabling us to take off our political hats and put on our parliamentary hats and to discuss issues in that Committee without hindering it with issues of policy is a tradition Senator Wood set. I hope I can leave this chamber with the sort of record he had as a parliamentarian. I extend my condolences to those who cared for him and to the people of Mackay. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the condolence motion for my late colleague Ian Wood, formerly a senator of this place for 28 years. I remember the first party meeting I attended back in 1976. I came here towards the end of the first year of the Fraser Government and I was a little concerned about some areas of dissent. We had such a majority in the Senate as well as in the House of Representatives that there seemed to be a bit of crossing the floor, and I did not approve of that very much. I made some reference to it in my preselection speech for my Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At my first party meeting three older gentlemen stood up and gave Malcolm Fraser one of the greatest serves I had ever heard about some issue that was before the meeting. I thought, `What on earth is going on here?' The first fellow was Sir Reginald Wright; I did recognise him. The second fellow was Bill Wentworth. The third person was a bloke I had never seen before, but it turned out to be Woody. They really did not mess around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall coming into the chamber on many occasions thereafter and repeatedly seeing Senator Wood and Senator Wright crossing the floor over many issues. I might say, Mr Deputy President, that they were encouraged by members of your Party. The Labor Party seemed to take great delight in seeing these fellows cross the floor. All I can say to members of the Labor Party is that these fellows did not need any encouragement. They could cross the floor at the drop of a hat; they had been doing so for many years. After all, Senator Wood had been here since 1950. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Wood arrived in this place in 1950 probably the first job he was given was not just to join but to become chairman of the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee. He remained chairman for the whole of his parliamentary career when we were in government. The only time he was not chairman was when the Labor Party was in government from 1972 to 1975. He was on that Committee for 28 1/2 years, of which he had 25 1/2 years as chairman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was lucky enough to be his successor. I can assure the Senate that he gave me an enormous earbashing about what I had to do as chairman of that Committee in standing up to Ministers. His complaint was not so much that Ministers would sign regulations that ought to have been disallowed, but that clearly the Ministers were not really studying the regulations before they signed them. His main complaint was about the bureaucracy. For his whole parliamentary career he was extremely critical of it. He was critical about the way in which the bureaucracy put before Ministers for signature regulations which very frequently interfered with the fundamental rights of ordinary citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ian Wood and Reg Wright gave me advice about how to make a clear distinction between a parliamentarian and a politician. It is not a distinction which is recognised in the general world but it is recognised in this chamber, where people are acting as parliamentarians. Unfortunately, under the current rigours of the party system which we now have imposed upon us, probably from within as well as by the media, there is much less crossing of the floor than occurred in those days. Perhaps Senator Wood could be described as one of the last true parliamentarians. I believe that he crossed the floor well over 100 times in his career. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Murphy referred to Senator Wood's reputation as an upholder of personal rights and the parliamentary institutions as probably being unsurpassed in this country. That is not a bad reference from Senator Murphy. Senator Wheeldon, another Labor senator, said that Senator Wood had been hailed as someone who `made a major contribution to democracy in this country'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have mentioned, Senator Wood's major concern was about `the passing of the power of this Parliament into the hands of the civil service or the Executive' and the need to `fight to retain powers in the hands of Parliament'. He did this right throughout his career. In 1965, during the time of Menzies, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is surprising that the Menzies Government should be guilty of quite a long list of attempts at erosion of the powers of the parliament when we remember that before we came to office in 1949 we talked about bureaucrats and so on. I am afraid that this Government has done as much as anyone to build up the bureaucracy as against what we consider the basis of real democracy.</PARA>
<PARA>He was critical of Sir Robert Menzies as Prime Minister. If we look at his career, we will see that he was critical of every Liberal Prime Minister. Senator Withers once said of him that it was under Senator Wood that senators old and new `learnt that occasionally one should stay with principle and not with one's party'. There is no doubt that we certainly learned those sorts of views from Senator Wood. In 1973 Senator Withers said of him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The quality of his service was not just in the fact that he was a good and active Chairman and that he enjoyed his work; the quality of service resided more in the fact that he had the courage to face his colleagues in government, to disagree with them and to come into this place and vote according to his conscience. No higher tribute could be paid to any senator.</PARA>
<PARA>As has been mentioned, Senator Wood was a self-educated man. He served for a long period as an alderman and a very long period as senator. There is no doubt that he made a great contribution to this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the stories that I heard about him, which has never really been contradicted, relates to Sir Robert Menzies. At the first Party meeting in the old Parliament House after the Liberals had retained office after quite a fight, Sir Robert told old and new Party members that he hoped that they would vote with the Government, but that if anyone truly felt that the Government was wrong that person had no alternative but to vote according to his conscience. Ian Wood frequently said that he was the only one who carried out Sir Robert Menzies' direction in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As early as 1959, Ian Wood drew attention to the danger that he saw of the control of Parliament slipping from the hands of the parliamentarians and Parliament being run by the civil servants. In the same debate, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no keener supporter of the Liberal-Country Party side of the Senate than I, but I am not so blind as to believe that every amendment suggested is an affront to the government. That is not my outlook on parliamentary life.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to thank one of the Senate officers for looking up some of these quotes for me. In 1967, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I did not come into this Parliament to be a yes man. I hold it to be my duty as a senator to make a decision on what is the right thing for this country. When a thing is right for the country it is my duty to vote for it. If a thing is not right for the country it is my duty to vote against it.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1970 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have represented Queensland since 1949 and I have done what lots of people in this chamber have not been prepared to do: I have voted according to my conscience, even if it meant that I was to be thrown out of the Parliament. It is to the credit of the Liberal Party that we have the freedom to express our conscience and it is to the credit of the Liberal Party that I have been re-endorsed time after time. Only about three months ago when it was last thought that I had been written off I was then endorsed for the forthcoming Senate election as No. 1 on the Queensland Senate ticket.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tate should have been voting according to his conscience; if he had, he might have ended up with a higher place than No. 4 on the Tasmanian Senate ticket. In 1971 Senator Wood said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that in this debate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this related to a report of the Standing Orders Committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">there is to be a free vote, but judging from the last division which took place, it is amazing how many senators on the one side of the chamber appeared to hold the same views. Of course it might be that they are unanimous in their opinions, but it seems rather strange to me that such a thing happened when we had what is termed a free vote. As far as I am concerned a free vote is one in which a person exercises his conscience. On this side of the chamber we are supposed to have freedom of conscience. Probably some senators consider that they exercised that freedom. I exercise my freedom of conscience at all times and therefore I do not require a special free vote. It is something that the Liberal Party is supposed to have but it is not always very evident.</PARA>
<PARA>One can see that he was inclined to give us a serve at the drop of a hat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to make reference to two things he said just prior to the end of his career. In 1977 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be the aim of everyone who comes here&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>meaning this Parliament&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to work in order to leave this Parliament a better place than he found it. That should be the ideal for all Parliamentarians.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, in 1978 shortly before he retired from the Senate, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am now serving my 29th year in this Chamber. . . I have not been afraid to express an opposite view to the view of my party when in government or in opposition.

<PARA>Geoffrey McLaren was born on 1 February 1921 at Koroit in Victoria. He was educated at Koroit and Woolsthorpe State schools. Before entering Federal Parliament he worked for over 20 years as a shearer, then as a poultry farmer for several years, which earned him the nickname in this place of `Feathers'&mdash;an expression by which he was affectionately described by all, I think, on both sides of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was elected to the Senate for South Australia in 1970, although he did not begin his term until 1971. During his time here he worked on several committees, amongst them the Industry and Trade Committee, the National Resources Committee and the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory. He was also a member of the House Committee for over eight years and served on nearly all the Estimates committees at some stage. He was a counsellor at the IPU meeting at Prague in 1976 and a member at the IPU conference at Caracas in 1979. In addition to that, he held the position in the Labor Party of Secretary of the Labor Party Resources Committee from 1976 to 1981, he was President of the Murray Bridge sub-branch of the ALP from 1957 and Chairman of the Murray District Assembly also from 1957.

Almost every night when most of us were tired and wanted to go home, even if there were no other senators speaking, in the course of a week he was always speaking and I kept a black book about that.

He certainly was a most doughty fighter for those Australians in agricultural areas and had great interest in issues affecting them on a wide scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He obviously had very great sympathy as well for the ordinary man and woman on the land. He understood their trials and problems and felt them very deeply and emotionally.

As a member of that Committee he would have worked in the same tireless way as he did in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Geoff McLaren was dedicated to Senate Estimates committees. Indeed, he is not the only senator I have known who has been dedicated to Estimates committees and who has asked questions over many days. Senator McLaren also maintained that devotion to the examination of estimates in the Committee of the Whole as well, and continued the debate for a very long time in this chamber even after having explored those matters in the Estimates committee hearings themselves. That factor was not unique to Senator McLaren, as there are other senators who are in that category. However, for many of those years he was in government rather than in opposition. Indeed, he was the champion of champions in persisting with questions on the appropriations both in Estimate committees and in this chamber.

Geoff McLaren and I shared a country background and a record of prior employment as manual workers. Partly for that reason, we had common policy interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During his life Geoff was many things: he was a fruit picker, a shearer, a soldier, a poultry farmer and, finally, a Labor politician. He was an old-fashioned Labor man, an appellation that he himself would have been very happy to accept. He had empathy for ordinary working people, the working class, if that term is preferred, and a keen appreciation of their values and aspirations. I think that if Geoff were alive today he would probably say that there is too little of that in the contemporary Australian Labor Party, a judgment with which I tend to agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Geoff McLaren had a tribal loyalty to the ALP. He used his boundless energy to proselytise and organise for it in the Parliament and in South Australia, particularly in the country areas. He pursued issues with great tenacity, a point which has been noted by other speakers. He was a large consumer of time on adjournment debates, first reading debates and Estimates committees. Other speakers have noted that he was not alone in being such a large consumer of time. There are people in the Senate who still do that. However, I would suggest that there is a qualitative difference between the two. The people who do that today do it principally for reasons of self-aggrandisement; Geoff McLaren did it for other reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the commemorative afternoon held at his home in Murray Bridge last Sunday, Graham Maguire, in opening the comments by the various people there, said that we should regard that event as a celebration of the life of Geoff McLaren. I thought that was a very good way to look at it and an attitude which those of us who were his friends should bear in mind. His death was somewhat premature&mdash;shortly before his seventy-first birthday. However, his illness was short. I am sure that Geoff would have been one of the last people who would have liked to have lived a long period but spend many years of it in ill health, even helpless, and not able to live the full and active life which he did live right up until about six weeks before his death. To his wife Beryl and the rest of his family, I endorse the sympathies and the sentiments that the other speakers have expressed. </PARA>

He knew his duties and he performed and pursued his responsibilities absolutely relentlessly, robustly and professionally. He was a formidable opponent who did his homework and did it very well. He was an example to us all for the way he did his homework. Geoff was well educated and knew the background of what he was dealing with. He knew the people he represented and had the practical experience to go with it. Geoff McLaren had both feet in the real world, and what he knew and how he got here were of his own making. He did things very well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I came into the Senate in 1976 Geoff McLaren was one of a group of quite colourful characters. People such as Bill Brown, Jim Cavanagh, Tony Mulvihill, the young and virile Peter Walsh and Geoff looked pretty tough stuff from the other side of the chamber. Looking back, I am sure that they really were. I regret, and it is a pity, that people of that calibre and background no longer get representation in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember very well the tussles at Estimates committees and on the adjournment. I remember the way that Geoff McLaren used to be able to quote the Standing Orders from A to Z at any time, how he had the uncanny knack of knowing when quorums would be difficult and of using the rights that the Standing Orders gave him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Geoff McLaren was absolutely relentless on the issues that he believed he should follow. However, he had a great sense of humour and was always good for a joke at someone else's expense or just jokes of any sort. I believe that that sort of sense of humour is essential for people who expect to stay in this place for any length of time and who want to be able to work and live at the same time. Most of all, I remember him for the work that he did. He worked and worked and worked. I do not think I have ever known anybody who worked harder than Geoff, particularly when he did not have a natural talent in this area in the first place. But he certainly put in the time and produced a lot to show for it. He represented his constituency very well indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some time Geoff and I had adjoining offices. That helped us to get to know one another much better. We always used to pop in and out of one another's offices. I remember the many discussions that we had on matters in which we had a mutual interest. It did not matter that we came from opposite sides of the chamber. If it was a matter to do with an interest group Geoff McLaren wanted to try to help it. I was the same. I found on those occasions that we could discuss things openly and clearly with one another in a totally non-political way. I was very pleased to enjoy that degree of confidence with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I respected Geoff McLaren as a very hard working colleague and formidable opponent. I certainly regret his passing. I have special thoughts for Beryl at this time. Again, because we were neighbours in the passage, we saw much of her. She was always good for a cup of tea at the right time. The Senate was certainly a lesser place when Geoff left it. I look forward to there being replacements of that nature in this chamber in time to come. </PARA>

Geoff was elected to the Senate in 1970 and took his place on 1 July 1971, over four years before I arrived after the 1975 election. However, as there was a double dissolution in 1975, Geoff was a candidate at that election, and as well as becoming Senate colleagues we became firm personal friends.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Geoff was a great battler for the Australian Labor Party and never let an opportunity of embarrassing his opponents pass by. I remember very well how during Senate debates Geoff would leave the chamber and soon return with documents from his own files to refute the arguments of his opponents. He did this regularly and must have developed a remarkable filing system. It was certainly better than mine. Over the past few days I have searched in vain for certain contributions of Geoff in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I know that they must be there because I can remember his making the remarks as though they were made yesterday. Unfortunately, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> retrieval system goes back only so far and many of Geoff's gems in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> are in parts which have not yet been computerised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Life was never dull in the Senate while Geoff McLaren was there. Whether his presence was appreciated by his opponents is another matter. His overriding ambition was to see Labor returned to government after its defeat in 1975. He was not in the Parliament when that occurred, having retired when the double dissolution of 1983 was announced. Although he was no longer a senator, he retained an abiding interest in politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have many fond memories of Geoff's performance in the Senate. I shall not go into great detail about those memories on this occasion for, with Geoff, it is hard not to recall those events in a non-party political manner. But those memories will remain, particularly with those of us who had the opportunity to be on the same side of the chamber as Geoff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us were often amused when Geoff would ask questions based on a newspaper called, I seem to remember, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Border Watch</EMPHASIS>. Quite often his questions would carry the assumption that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Border Watch</EMPHASIS> was the ultimate reference on a particular topic. I have no doubt that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Border Watch</EMPHASIS> was a respected and well-known newspaper in the area where Geoff lived in South Australia, but it was hardly prescribed reading for other honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As mentioned earlier, Geoff was good naturedly referred to as `Feathers', due to one of his former occupations as a poultry farmer. I can remember well when former Senator Douglas McClelland, who had&mdash;and indeed still has&mdash;a marvellous sense of humour, was highly amused about an interchange which took place when I was complaining about the lack of post office facilities at Hungerford in south western Queensland. Before I quote from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, I mention that in those days Queensland did not have Lotto or, as we call it in Queensland, Gold Lotto, so there is a reference in here to explain what Lotto is. I pick up towards the end of my speech where I say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Against the background of the possibility of Hungerford's losing its post office, I came into Parliament House this week and was absolutely amazed when I went down to our own post office in Parliament House and found that it is now an agent for Lotto. For those who are not aware what Lotto is&mdash;I imagine that some of my constituents in Queensland will not be&mdash;it is a type of lottery, or what we in Queensland call the Golden Casket. Where are our priorities? After 112 years Hungerford will lose its post office. After 53 years we in Parliament House, through our post office, will have an agency for Lotto.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Geoff McLaren then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How about chook raffles?</PARA>
<PARA>I replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Senator McLaren so appropriately says, we will soon have chook raffles.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with many members of parliament, a good deal of Geoff's work went unnoticed. I remember when he enlisted my support to expose a charlatan who was working out of Queensland and who had defrauded one of Geoff's constituents in South Australia. He and I worked on this matter for some time. Eventually the unscrupulous character was exposed and an end was put to his activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I last saw Geoff less than a year ago at Barcaldine during the centenary celebrations for the Australian Labor Party. It was a mark of Geoff's commitment to the Labor movement that, with his wife Beryl, he took his caravan all the way from South Australia to be present for the celebrations. It is a reminder of the uncertainty of the future that, when I renewed acquaintances with Geoff at Barcaldine, I had no inkling that I would be speaking so soon on a condolence motion for his passing. If I had not been out of the country at the time, I would have paid my respects at Geoff's funeral. </PARA>

Geoff was always a jovial character who, in common with the rugged tradition of shearers, always appreciated a good joke.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Geoff will be remembered for two great attributes which he displayed during his 12 years in the Senate. One was his desire to help people. His family played an important role in this, and they were extremely precious to him. He cared deeply for them. He applied his same caring attitudes to the many country people who came to him for help. Secondly, he made a daily habit of reading the whole of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Consequently, he always knew all sides of the issues and would comment frequently, particularly on the adjournment, on the issues of the previous day. Like a heeler dog, his persistence in questioning earned him a special notoriety in the old Parliament House, especially during the Senate Estimates hearings. Perhaps the greatest tribute for those who remain is to follow those two important practices of Geoff's. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak in support of this condolence motion for former Senator Geoff McLaren. I knew Geoff McLaren not as a senator in this place but as a party official in the State branch of South Australia. For much of the time Geoff was a senator, I was either the State Secretary or Assistant State Secretary or State organiser of the Labor Party in South Australia. I spent many occasions in the rural areas of South Australia with Geoff. I remember as a very young organiser in 1970 going on an organising trip to the west coast of South Australia and discovering that Geoff's idea of a good start to each day's work was to rise at five and be on the road at six. I must say that I had always thought that 5 o'clock in the morning was the time for one to go to bed and that one would get up at about 10. Geoff started early, worked hard all day and went to bed early. So it took some cultural adjustment for me to get into the rhythm of Geoff's work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say, as a former party official, that in my time in the Labor Party in South Australia no senator or member of parliament has worked harder than Geoff in the non-metropolitan areas of South Australia on behalf of the Labor Party. Geoff at one stage used to put out a leaflet saying that he was the only senator elected in South Australia who had his electoral office in the non-metropolitan area. He used to make that point very strongly against Opposition members, who all had their offices in King William Street. Geoff was the first person to have a senator's office outside the metropolitan area. Now many of us have followed suit in one form or another and have our offices in the suburbs or elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Geoff's activities in the rural areas were well known. He established enormous credibility in the rural community. He had a mailing list for his newsletter that ran into thousands. Every month or so he would mail out a newsletter outlining issues, and if one called into the McLaren household one would often find him and Beryl up at all hours of the night stuffing envelopes with his newsletter. Not only Geoff but the McLaren family were great supporters of the Labor Party. In everything Geoff did he was strongly supported by Beryl in particular, who was a great strength to him, and his other family members, particularly Harold and Doug. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand his reputation as a member of the Estimates Committee. When we were in opposition I heard the legion stories of Geoff being able to keep an Estimates committee hearing going hour after hour after hour, and, as Senator Walsh said, not just for the sake of longevity but as a tenacious operator seeking information on issues that he believed important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I attended the commemorative service at Geoff McLaren's home last Sunday, with my colleagues Senator Walsh and Senator Maguire. I agree with Senator Maguire's remarks: we were there to commemorate the life of Geoff McLaren. Not only was he a great senator and a great member of the Labor Party; he was also a great member of the Australian community who all his life in his own way worked very hard, particularly for those people whom he believed were being hard done by by the vicissitudes of society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the condolence motion for the late Geoff McLaren. It was a sudden, surprising death because he was here just late last year. I counted Geoff a friend. I might say that that was not easy; perhaps I will come to that later on. Geoff was born in Koroit and worked in Woolsthorpe. They are areas near where I come from&mdash;Warrnambool and Port Fairy, the same region as Cyril Primmer, another former senator, came from&mdash;and Geoff used to remind me that he came from that area from time to time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have to say, along with my other colleagues, that he frequently drove us mad in the Senate with his tenacious&mdash;and I agree that he was tenacious&mdash;speeches and questioning. I can recall that he took up one matter in particular, and that was the lingering loans made to certain Fraser Ministers. Those loans had been made to them when they were fairly new members of parliament, and were still lingering when they were Ministers on ministerial salaries. Geoff McLaren hung on to that bone like a dog&mdash;certainly he never gave it away, not even to his last day in this place&mdash;and probably even last year when he was up here he would have raised with some of those people whether those loans had been paid off or not. That was the sort of tenacity that Geoff brought to his position as a senator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He made it clear that he gave no quarter. As I say, he used, in fact, to drive all of us mad. I might say that he even used to drive some of his own colleagues mad by going on on the adjournment debate. Apart from that, it was apparent that he had an enormous memory for detail. As Mr Deputy President has said, he must have had a great filing system, but to have a great filing system I think you have to have a great memory to be able to realise that there is something there and go to the files and find it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators have referred to the fact that he retired in 1983. I have to say to the members of the Labor Party that I do not think that that retirement was voluntary. In 1983 Senator McLaren was age barred by the Labor Party because he would have turned 65, I think, after he had served in the Senate for about 5 3/4 years. Because he was about two or three months older than he should have been, he was not allowed to stand for preselection in 1983. I do not think that Geoff was very happy about that rule at that stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned the difficulty of friendship. I think that Geoff probably came into the Senate with a deep and enduring hatred of the Liberal Party and Liberals. As for the National Party, his hatred would have been even deeper. He probably found after he had been here for some time that, while he would never forgive the Liberal Party for being a conservative party or the National Party for having no policies or principles at all&mdash;as I think he would have said&mdash;there were a number of us who were not so bad and so friendships developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, friendships were inevitable with Geoff because he had such an irrepressible humour. Even when he was driving us mad he would be laughing and we could not help but smile with him at some of the things he was going on about.

I did not have the privilege of working with him or knowing him before he came into the Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been pointed out, he was elected in 1970 and began his term in 1971. As a result of the ALP's age rule in South Australia, his term expired effectively in February 1983 when Malcolm Fraser called the double dissolution for the 1983 elections. Senator McLaren served for almost 12 years in the Senate. He worked tirelessly in the latter part of that period to return Labor to the treasury bench in Canberra, but unfortunately, he did not have the opportunity to be a member of the Government from 1983 onwards as his term expired at the time that the election was called. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I pointed out, I did not actually serve here while Senator McLaren was a member, but I know that he is spoken of with awe, certainly regarding Estimates committees. Other senators have referred to Estimates here this afternoon. He certainly used the procedures to the fullest to expose waste and mismanagement and incompetence. Of course, he also used the adjournment debates regularly and repeatedly to bring up grievances on behalf of constituents and certainly to publicise rorts and mismanagement. I also know that he used what has now become the very fashionable device of giving notices of motion. He certainly used that procedural device many times when he was in the Senate. I know this first hand because he used to ring me up in Adelaide and ask me for ideas about what he might actually do on a particular day to embarrass the Government with notices of motion on particular issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Geoff McLaren was a great Party man. His life very much was the Labor Party. He focused on country areas and country ALP members.

I think also, as has been pointed out here earlier, his recreation was very much the ALP as well, and working for it.

At times, he did drive us mad. He spoke interminably about the particular detail that he thought was of greatest concern to some person, especially in South Australia. He did wear out the patience of many of us in the Senate. He was out to support his party, the Labor Party, at all times and in the way that he thought would be most effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I first came to know of Geoff McLaren in the first couple of months of my time here. In my maiden speech of September 1978, I happened to express my concern as a South Australian about the recent Budget decision of the Fraser Government to introduce an increased brandy tax. I remember saying that the Government had got 99 things right and that this one was wrong and that I had yet to be convinced that this would be other than counterproductive. It would not raise the money that was projected and it would just add to the burden of those grape growers, especially in the Riverland, who, of course, would sell their excess grapes for brandy production. So this was something that was going to hurt the people of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It turned out that the remarks that I, Geoff McLaren and Geoff Giles, the local Liberal member, all raised were correct.

But, of course, having expressed such a concern at a decision of my own colleagues and of my own Prime Minister&mdash;I was a new young senator from South Australia; at that time I think I was only 33&mdash;Geoff McLaren noted that immediately in his voluminous files. When the time came for asserting whether we supported the Budget or not, he was without mercy in his attack upon me and my apparent, to him, inconsistency in not then voting against the Budget even though 99 things were right with it and this one thing was wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very glad when, only a couple of months after this, I had the pleasure of sharing a room in a hotel on Thursday Island in the Torres Strait with Geoff McLaren and all his jovial humour.

It was a quarantine inquiry which took us to look at that link with Papua New Guinea and Queensland in terms of safeguarding Australia through quarantine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention just one other matter which Geoff would have gloried in: television in this chamber. He served in the old Parliament House, in which we did not have television. But I remember on one occasion&mdash;I think it was following the 1980 election&mdash;that he brought in a newspaper headline, probably from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Border Watch</EMPHASIS>, which read `Lies, lies, lies'. He held it up and had it put, I think, on every table in the Senate because this was the one newspaper in the whole of Australia which identified with his assessment that one of the promises of the then Fraser Government was not going to be lived up to or had not been lived up to. I cannot even remember whether it was a matter of history or some assessment as to the coming election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But with real drama and with all the persistence and determination that he had in Estimates committees, in questions, in notices, in interjections, in points of order and in his committee work, he made sure that we all understood that he regarded the Fraser Government as not living up to the promises that those on the Liberal and National side had made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention only one other matter, and that is that Senator McLaren, as Senator Schacht said, had his office outside the metropolitan area. Whilst Senator Wood obviously had his main base in Mackay, it was rare in the 1970s for any honourable senator to have an office located anywhere other than in the central business district. We all know that Feathers McLaren had his office at Murray Bridge. That actually had a positive effect on me in that I really did admire his closeness to the ordinary people of the State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we lost government in 1983, I happened to be then second to Feathers McLaren in moving my own electorate office out of the central business district to the Marion shopping centre in an attempt to try to win back the seats of Kingston and Hawker. As campaign manager in Hawker, I eventually succeeded in being a part of that victory by 14 votes in the last election. It was very much with Senator McLaren's example in mind that I moved out to an area in a shopping centre where I could be more approachable and more accessible to that part of the State that I wished more directly to serve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This closeness to the country people reminds me that I have always felt that Geoff McLaren was closest to Peter Walsh. I know that he was inspired by Peter Walsh's analysis, from the Labor Party's point of view, of country issues. Peter Walsh was, at that time, writing a newsletter for country people that was, I think, amongst those that Geoff and Mrs McLaren would have stayed up so many nights to distribute in South Australia. He was, as Senator Walsh has said, one of the old-style Labor members and I especially respect him for the sincerity with which he represented his party's point of view but more especially for the tenacity with which he battled for the ordinary people of South Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was deeply saddened by the death of Geoff McLaren. He was a person that I had worked with in this place as well as within the Labor movement. During my time in the South Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party, I have met and worked with many notable characters. Amongst these have been some of the most well-known South Australians. The person to whom we pay our respects today, Geoff McLaren, was one of those well-known people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between 1971 and 1983 he worked tirelessly in this place for the benefit of his State, for the benefit of his Party and, most significantly, for the benefit of the working men and women of this country. His enthusiasm for the betterment of the union cause was matched by his willingness to use this institution and, indeed, all provisions of the Westminster system to further the principles that he believed in. Throughout his term in this place he continually asked questions, made speeches and raised issues that he felt needed to be addressed. He fought for the less privileged, he battled for the worker and at all times he tried to make a difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a senator, he was active on committees as well as in the chamber. His particular interest was Estimates committees, as has been mentioned before, in which he was a lively participant. While he was in the Senate he was on nearly every Estimates committee at some time. For several years he served on two. His political dynamism was evidenced in the broad range of issues that he took a serious interest in during his political career. Aboriginal affairs, primary industry and industrial relations were just a few of his main interest areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whenever he made a point about any issue, he always looked at it from a South Australian perspective as well as a national one. Indeed, he was a very patriotic South Australian who had particular concerns about rural South Australian issues. As a former poultry farmer from Murray Bridge, he used the wealth of knowledge that he had to assist in the formulation of public policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Geoff stayed in Murray Bridge after entering the Senate and continued to serve the specific interests of the people there. In fact, he has been described as being a regional senator. He toured the southern and eastern areas of South Australia regularly and became well known in provincial and farming communities. Geoff was always willing to speak out about anything he felt strongly about. He was even willing to protest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been said, once he wore shorts into this chamber to make a point about dress standard rules. On another occasion he boycotted the presentation of a sword to the Black Rod on the grounds that the sword represented war and was `an offensive weapon'. He was also noted for being strongly influenced by the events of November 1975. After the dismissal of the Whitlam Government his condemnation of Kerr's actions and the ongoing fight against Kerr indicated just how strongly he felt about those events. This activity occurred long after the issue had died down in the public sphere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After he left this place, Geoff was still actively involved in his Party and his community. He also served on the executive of the South Australian chapter of the Association of Retired Members of the Federal Parliament. He is particularly missed by the other members of that organisation, who were continually supportive of him and his family during his illness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to extend to Beryl and the rest of Geoff's family my deepest sympathy at this time. I know that all honourable senators share these thoughts with me. I also know that many South Australians would be aware of the contributions that Geoff McLaren made to this place and no doubt they also will be sad at his passing. </PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">all of which have been comprehensively addressed by the Coalition's Fightback! program of reform.</PARA>
<PARA>The motion of urgency is a matter on which the Opposition believes urgent action needs to be taken. It is for that reason that we have introduced this as a matter of urgency rather than just as a matter of public importance. My colleagues Senator Herron and Senator Tierney will address those aspects of the matter of urgency relating to hospital and health care and education respectively. I will concentrate my remarks on the first part of the motion, namely, the need for the Government to take urgent action to increase employment by reducing business costs, increasing productivity and improving the climate for investment. All of these matters have been comprehensively addressed by the coalition's Fightback program of reform, which was released late last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has plunged Australia into a grave economic and social crisis. The architect of that economic and social crisis&mdash;the most serious crisis in this country for the last 60 years&mdash;is none other than the now Prime Minister, Mr Keating. Labor's engineered recession&mdash;the recession, honourable senators will recall, that Mr Keating said we had to have&mdash;has destroyed thousands of businesses and families throughout Australia and has created untold misery and hardship for millions of Australians. The level of national savings has collapsed; so has the level of investment. Of course, without investment and economic growth, there can be no jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The official rate of unemployment is now more than 10 per cent and it will go higher, even on the Government's own reckoning. The underlying rate of unemployment exceeds 14 per cent, taking into account those who in despair have given up looking up for work. There are now well over one million people out of work in Australia. Those who are underemployed add at least another half million to those who are effectively out of work. Youth unemployment has reached the scandalous figure of more than 30 per cent. In some areas, including the former Prime Minister's electorate of Wills&mdash;about which I gave a notice of motion earlier today&mdash;youth unemployment is in the order of 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very difficult to comprehend the hardship and the despair for the future that that causes for the young people and the older people who are out of work. It was only two years ago, on 12 March 1990, that the then leader of the Government told the people of Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And I'll tell you what, if you vote for me what you'll get is a continuation of record employment growth . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That was just two weeks before the 1990 election. Since then the full forces of the recession have hit us mightily. Only a few months later, in November 1990, the then Treasurer, the now Prime Minister, at last came clean and said, `Yes, this was an engineered recession, a recession we had to have'. He said, `I knew there had to be a recession but I didn't want to tell you'. At the same time, with the worst of the recession was yet to come, in November 1990 the same Treasurer, the now Prime Minister, said that the worst was behind us, that we would recover by the middle of 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1991, when this recovery was supposed to have occurred and when Mr Keating, the loyal deputy, as he then was, to Prime Minister Hawke was preparing his first political assassination coup attempt against the Prime Minister, he said that we would definitely have recovery by the end of 1991. Mr Keating was wrong again. He has been wrong, he has deceived the Australian people for nine years. I believe that the greatest test Mr Keating has&mdash;a test that I believe it is impossible for him to pass&mdash;is to convince the Australian public that he has any credibility left. He has shown no credibility in his statements over the past nine years. He has shown, quite frankly, that his statements cannot be believed. I believe that the Australian people are going to react very strongly to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where does this shell shocked Government, led by a man who has shelled and shocked the Australian economy and the Australian people into great hardship and bleak despair, go from here? We have just seen that private new capital expenditure in the December quarter of last year declined by 11 per cent from the September quarter, which itself was sadly low. The figure was down 14 per cent from a year earlier. Estimated new capital expenditure for this year is 15 per cent lower than the corresponding estimate last year. New capital spending in the year ahead, 1992, on present forecasts and surveys looks likely to be down by a further 9 per cent. As I said, when investment is so depressed there is little hope for struggling businesses and for the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key to it all is confidence. But who can have any confidence in this Government, led as it now is by a man whose whole record is one of deceit and broken promises? What does the Government do? One thing is certain and that is that pump priming the economy with a spending binge is not the answer. Pump priming might suit the socialists and the traditional big spending instincts of Labor, but it would destroy any prospects of recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the head of the Treasury, Tony Cole, warned only last week, boosting Government spending in an attempt to kick-start the economy could quickly bring on an exchange rate and balance of payments crisis, leading to higher interest rates and depressing investment even further. No wonder Mr Cole said that. It is odd for the head of the Treasury to be saying that. We now know why: he is distancing himself from the Government's economic statement of tomorrow. Why is he doing that? He is doing that because the Treasury and, to a large extent, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) have been frozen out of the formulation and preparation of the economic statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We already have the seeds of a major division between the Prime Minister and his new Treasurer. We also have similar seeds of division in the way that two Cabinet Ministers&mdash;Senator Button and Simon Crean&mdash;have had their proposals rolled in Cabinet. By jove, they must be a happy little bunch of disunited and divided Ministers sitting around the Cabinet table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Access Economics has warned that of the various policy options open to the Government, pump priming is least likely to be of value to the labour market. Labor's problem is its desperation to get things moving before the next election. It is therefore absolutely obsessed with priming the political pump.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the economy cannot afford any more stimulus over and above what has already been built into the system. There have been substantial reductions in interest rates, the lagged effects of which will take some nine to 12 months to follow through the system. There has been a massive fiscal turnaround over the last two years of about $17 billion, certainly a minimum of $13 billion, to which I will return in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has done some economic modelling on various possibilities that might arise from tomorrow night's statement. We recently requested that the Parliamentary Research Service of the Department of the Parliamentary Library use the well known and highly respected Murphy model of the Australian economy to examine the consequences of a boost to Federal Government spending of up to, say, $3 billion and the highly possible fall in the exchange rate that would result of around US74c to US70c. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Murphy model shows in detail that such a course of action would add 2.6 percentage points to the inflation rate by the end of the financial year 1992-93. That would result in an inflation rate of at least 6.1 per cent by the time of the next election. Employment would be boosted temporarily by a mere 50,000 jobs by the end of 1992-93, but the level of unemployment would be boosted three years down the track and foreign debt would rise from the already staggeringly high figure of around $130 billion to $135 billion today to a figure of $167.8 billion by the time of the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely amazing that the Government over the other side seems to be saying, `Let's go full steam ahead, let's pump prime the economy and let's dam the torpedos that will result from it'. It is exactly the sort of attitude that in the early years of the Hawke-Keating Government led to the damaging boom-bust cycle from which Australia is presently suffering and through which in recent years we have lived. It is an attitude that has led to the enormous build-up in Australia's foreign debt which, since this Government came in, is now 35 per cent of our total annual output compared with 11 per cent in 1983 when the Hawke Government came in. In fact, it looks as though this Government is again cranking up the old fallacious arguments about pump priming and spending that really went out of fashion a long time ago. The consequences of what the Government seems to be proposing to do will be horrendous indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Market analysts and private economic forecasters have already estimated that the Budget deficit for 1991-92&mdash;which honourable senators may recall was planned at the last election to come in at $4.7 billion for 1991-92&mdash;is now likely to blow out to somewhere between $8 billion or $9 billion; and that does not take into account at all any further blow-out from new expenditure that will be announced tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the Government to bring the Budget in on track in line with its forecasts&mdash;and its latest forecast are only a little more than the $7.4 billion&mdash;there will have to be a turnaround, a different outcome, in the Budget balance between the first and second halves of 1991-92 of around $17 billion. Nothing like that has ever remotely happened before in Australia. The largest previous turnaround in a Budget was $12.6 billion, which was in the rapid recovery phase of 1986-87, and not even the Government is forecasting a recovery of that magnitude. Even to come in with a deficit of only $8 billion would require a $14 billion turnaround between the first and second halves of this year, which is still greater than any previous record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economy would have to boom at an unprecedented rate for the Government's Budget forecast, now revised to a little over $5 billion, to be accurate. Indeed, if such a strong economic recovery is under way or even expected, then why is the Government about to announce tomorrow the single largest deliberate relaxation in fiscal policy in nearly a decade?  I say `deliberate relaxation' because there has, of course, been an enormous unplanned $13 billion to $16 billion relaxation over the past two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in the Budget deficit will have to be funded by additional sales of government bonds; that is, by plunging the Government and the public sector further into debt. Various analysts&mdash;for example, Schroders&mdash;calculate that the Government will require an additional $3 billion to $3 1/2 billion in funds compared with the planned program for 1991-92. If that were all met by additional bond tenders, then the total requirement for the year would increase to $14 billion, leaving about $6 billion to be raised in the last four months of this financial year. That would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, given the current weakening in the bond market because of the lack of confidence in the market about where the Government is going from here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government would have to resort almost certainly to issuing Treasury notes and running down cash balances. Either way, what would happen is obvious: bond prices would fall, interest rates would rise, and the short term pump priming would soon be swamped by higher inflation, a choking of activity, a loss of confidence and more unemployment when the bills come in. One could scarcely imagine a more grossly irresponsible course of action by any government. It simply shows the cost of political ambition, the desperate grab to stay in power regardless of what it does to the country. The tragedy is that it will be average Australians who will bear the cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inevitable outcome of the Government's political survival strategy will be higher inflation, higher interest rates and a very sad delay in sustained economic recovery. This desperate and demoralised Labor Government has abandoned any sense of fiscal responsibility and is opting for the tried and proven failure of stimulating the economy with bigger and bigger deficits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What should the Government be doing?  If it had a longer term perspective, if it had any real concern for the future of this country and its people, it could take its cue from the coalition's Fightback package of economic reforms. It would accelerate the process of structural reform. It would tighten fiscal policy so that all public expenditure is covered by public revenue. It would ensure that monetary policy is run according to the objective of price stability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Government does not have a longer term perspective. All it cares about, as I have said, is the next election. It says to the Australian people, `After that you can all be damned'. Despite the fact that the Government can rescue neither itself nor the Australian economy in time for the election in 1993, it seems intent on attempted short term fixes, regardless of the long term challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So how will the Government's statement be judged tomorrow night? There are nine basic tests to apply to the Government's economic statement. These are the tests by which the statement must be judged. These are the tests that will determine if the statement contains any substance. These tests are: does the statement tomorrow night make Australia a more attractive and profitable place in which to invest?  Does the statement increase national savings? Does it introduce such savings initiatives as those referred to by Senator Newman in her notice of motion put before the Senate earlier today to introduce superannuation for women who work in the home and whose retirement needs have been totally ignored during the nine years of the Hawke and Keating Governments?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does the statement reduce the Budget deficit? What does it do to the bottom line? Does it reduce inflation and lead to stable currency? Does it lower interest rates? Does it reduce business costs? Does it include labour market reform, the essential ingredient to raising productivity and therefore to economic growth and employment creation in Australia?  Does it remove arbitrary impediments such as the green, red and black tape to development? A decision on Coronation Hill here would be a litmus test of the Government's resolve on resource development. As Senator Peter Walsh, the former Minister for Finance, said just a month ago:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government fails to reverse the decision on Coronation Hill, its proclaimed commitment to job growth should not be taken seriously.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with Senator Walsh and I also will watch with interest to see what happens on that matter tomorrow night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the test will be whether the statement will restore confidence and provide opportunity and vision for Australians as we move rapidly towards the next century. The Fightback package of reforms introduced by the coalition passes all those tests. The Government's economic statement must do the same if it hopes to do anything constructive to increase employment and provide any hope for the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is on notice tomorrow night to the fact that these are the tests by which it will be judged. These matters are urgent and vital as they affect the lives of every Australian. That is why the Opposition has brought forward this motion for debate today. I urge the Senate to support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is passing strange that on the eve of a significant economic statement that will restructure the economy, the Government is called upon to act urgently. This is an urgency motion, and the Government will vote against it. It will do so for the reason that the motion itself gives the impression that nothing is happening, which is patently wrong. It also gives the impression that no urgent action is being taken to improve upon the positive signs in the Australian economy. That also is wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tomorrow the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will put down a significant economic statement. I appreciate that the Opposition, in this urgency motion, may wish to try to damage or tarnish the impact of that statement before it arises. Indeed, Senator Short said, `What the Government is about to do tomorrow will be very damaging indeed'. I suggest that Senator Short should wait and see before he condemns what the Government does. I imagine that in this urgency motion the Opposition will try to winkle from us details of what the statement will contain, and indeed to pre-empt its impact. We will not be forthcoming about these details in this debate; it is best to wait for the statement. Over the last few months this has been a piece of very professional government by the Government of Australia. This is an occasion in which there has been no leaking, as unfortunately has bedevilled us on some of these things in the past. It is proof that our act is well and truly together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tomorrow will be the first major economic pronouncement by the first Keating Government of Australia. It will give a vision for this country, not just for the year ahead, but into the future beyond that. It will be a statement aimed at stimulating economic growth, and by so doing it will stimulate employment opportunities for those Australians who are unemployed and those who wish to improve their career prospects. It will be a statement, too, that will maintain the record low level of inflation that this country has at last arrived at because of the economic management of our Government. The statement will be committed to continuing the structural reform that we have undertaken in the economy that so underpins the future hopes of our economic strengthening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the Hewson consumption tax package, this will be a positive statement. It arises not out of a government sitting in Canberra twirling the dials of economic models. It will arise out of an extensive period by the Prime Minister and senior economic Ministers in consulting with the Australian community, among business leaders, among representatives of business organisations, unions and other parts of the community, as to what needs to be done to further stimulate the economy. Therefore, it will be an example of a government acting with and through the community to implement its best ideas and not something dreamed up in a back room in front of the flickering dial of a computer or in the reams of computer printouts. It will be a real live flesh and blood statement associated with what has to be done in a practical world, unlike the Hewson consumption tax package which reflects the flickering screen mentality of computer driven economics and modelling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been done until now provides a worthwhile springboard for this statement to bounce from to achieve the result at which it is aimed. What we have achieved through past fiscal restraint and responsibility as a government is an ability to have a cushion to undertake now responsible stimulation of the economy. What Senator Short has said, quoting from the Secretary of the Treasury&mdash;and I do not suspect that he has taken that quote out of context&mdash;in the emphasis he has given is too strong. He said that a kick-start could bring about a spending binge which will increase interest rates. We have brought down interest rates in the last 18 months by 7.5 per cent. But we have now, because of our fiscal rectitude of past years, obtained for ourselves in the economy a cushion by which we can now effect responsible and proper stimulation of the economy without arriving at the result forecast for us in the doom-saying speech of Senator Short. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, in common with other countries, is affected by the world economic recession, but Australia, unlike the United States, for example, has the capacity to which I have just referred. It is true to say that the recent statement by President Bush to stimulate the United States economy had less scope to undertake the stimulatory reform that we now have scope for because we have managed to achieve that cushion by the responsibilities of the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say to those who talk about further fiscal discipline or further cuts to the Budget, that what has now occurred means that one cannot address the issue of cutting more deeply into outlays unless one starts attacking major programs which will hurt people in areas of real need. One of the big defaults of Opposition spokesmen on the economy is to call blandly for further cuts without specifying on whose head those cuts will fall and who will be damaged and made worse off in our community. There can be no question of our deserting a commitment to social equity by having indiscriminate cutting which damages ordinary people in a position of real need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have worked hard to put into place a fundamental structure for the economy. I go to some of the things that we have achieved to indicate the underlying strength of the restructuring that we have been able to achieve in the Australian economy. The first point I refer to is the level of inflation. It is now the lowest for almost 30 years; it hit the 1.5 per cent inflation level about four weeks ago on the release of the December figures. It is now below both the average inflation levels of the OECD and the average inflation levels of our major trading partners. Clearly, an economic objective must be to lock in and make permanent as a feature of our economic landscape that low inflation level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that is often passed over in this debate because it is convenient for the Opposition to ignore it is that during the period of this Government we have managed to return the profit share so that in an expanding economy there are more and more funds for reinvestment into Australia. The profit share at the end of September last year&mdash;the latest figure&mdash;was put at 14.2 per cent. I compare that to the profit share in the 1982-83 recession when Opposition members comprised the then Government. At that time the profit share was 10.6 per cent&mdash;I refer to the September 1982 figure. The profit share now is in reasonable balance. So with economic recovery it should generate the funds for further investments. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have achieved that through a wages policy which works&mdash;not through a wing and a prayer style wages policy that is aimed at institutionalising the Fraser Government's system of confrontation and standover. Whereas in the 1982-83 period there was a wages explosion which aggravated the recession,  we have managed to deliver in this country, over nine years of the Hawke Government and now a few months of the Keating Government, a responsible wages outcome. That will be a continuing feature of our economic management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, I turn to one of the strong areas of performance by this Government, and that is in micro-economic reform. Australia has undergone major micro-economic reform restructuring. We are now far more competitive as an economy than we were in 1983. With a return to growth, the advantages of that painful&mdash;and at times arduously argued and negotiated&mdash;restructuring will be felt. The major productivity gains have been on the Australian waterfront. While that is an area in which the Opposition claims it can go faster, better and higher, its answer seems to be not to do it by consensus, agreement and common commitment to achieve the goal of restructuring. Its answer seems to be that if there is resistance it will put in the troops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me quote what was said by the managing director of the Australian Wheat Board&mdash;a place in the Australian community from which one does not necessarily expect to hear complimentary comments about this Government. In referring to the restructuring and major productivity changes of the Australian waterfront, the managing director of the Australian Wheat Board stated at the end of last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian ports are now among the most efficient grain loading ports in the world.</PARA>
<PARA>That is just one of a number of unsolicited testimonials to what are at last now coming through as being significant gains in micro-economic reform on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point on which I would dwell in order to make the case for micro-economic reform and how effective it has been is, of course, a reference to the change in the composition of exports from this country. Manufacturing exports out of this country are now booming. What is significant about that is that they are booming at a time when there is a world economic recession and the markets into which we are selling are recessed. That means that, with world economic recovery, our improvement in manufacturing exports should go even further; it should go up as world economic growth escalates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD figures show that Australia has the best growth record in manufacturing exports in the OECD bloc. We have performed better in expanding the amount of manufactured exports out of our country than any other OECD country. In real terms, the annual growth of manufacturing exports has been 15 per cent plus over the last five years. Compare that with the OECD average of the most developed countries of 6 per cent real growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I wish to make relates to the highly contentious area of labour market reform. We are witnessing significant labour market reform in this country, occurring not without pain but certainly harmoniously across the country. Extensive restructurings have been going on in the Australian workplace. It is now more typically the case that there is greater flexibility, greater commitment to training and greater productivity as a consequence of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The favoured index often cited by our opponents is the level of industrial disputation. What is true about our performance is that the level of industrial disputation in this country is now 60 per cent below what it was during the same average period of the Fraser years. We have achieved significant change in the labour market without industrial disputation. This sets us up for a productivity surge in the general economy and for growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can cite two examples which are perhaps worthwhile mentioning in this context. They are small examples but they are typical of the sorts of changes that we are achieving. Take the note printing branch of the Australian Treasury that actually prints the money that we use. Workplace negotiations in that area resulted in an agreement being reached in October last year with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The negotiations were linked to extensive restructuring in the organisation as a result of the dramatic improvements in productivity and efficiency. In its first year of commercial operation, Note Printing Australia delivered 445 million notes to the Reserve Bank compared with 275 million in the previous year. The average price in the latest period was more than 30 per cent lower and efficiency improvements are continuing to be made. That is a good example of improved productivity in an area in which significant workplace change has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second example I offer is that of ASTA Aircraft Services Pty Ltd, another government business organisation. This organisation recently negotiated a pace setting workplace agreement. The company and its unions have been forerunners in industrial relations reform and improvements in productivity. The improvements at its plant have been exceptional. It has introduced cellular working groups, total quality management and significantly revised rostering arrangements. There have already been reductions in overhead costs and improvements in on-time delivery. There has also been a 50 per cent increase in flow time on aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company, which was set up in 1988 with 100 staff, now employs 720 people. Because of the significant changes in productivity and efficiency, it has become more competitive and has been able to grow and employ more people. They are models of the sorts of workplace reform that this Government is undertaking in the wider area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should not conclude without referring to tariff reform. In March last year we announced a major industry statement in which we committed ourselves to faster tariff reform. Tariff reform provides a simple discipline in which Australian business has to look outwardly at the world and become more world competitive. It faces world competition on the global scale with the removal of this level of protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we are not in a race with the Opposition. The Opposition has called for faster, quicker reform with further reductions over a shorter period to end up with zero protection or negligible protection in the end. One has to say that that is a scenario which has the potential of burning Australian industry into the ground and removing industry capability to compete on a world scale by removing protection too rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are committed to the discipline of reduced protection. We think our scale of reduction is right. It ensures a continuing discipline on industry to become more competitive. But to do it at the level the Opposition preaches would mean that industry would become unable to compete and therefore would go to the wall. That is not something that we support. We support the view that industry be given time to make the adjustment and that the other necessary micro-economic reform changes in the wider economy and in the labour market should also have a chance to come through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to conclude by talking for a few moments about the Hewson consumption tax package. Will that solve the problems confronting this country? What is being proposed is essentially a book entry method of changing the revenue side of the Budget in the way in which tax is collected. If one changes the way in which revenue is collected, will that somehow or other help solve the major economic problems in this economy? The ringing answer to that question is no. One cannot replace, as the Hewson consumption tax package seeks to do, or modify significantly a progressive system of taxation with essentially a regressive system and supporting compensation and achieve the significant reform that needs to be made. One queries whether the level of compensation is credible or believable and whether it would continue. One queries whether the level or the amount of direct taxes that will be imposed by a consumption tax on all the goods and services we purchase will remain fixed. No economy in the world that I can think of has introduced a consumption tax and then kept the level of taxation the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the myriad flaws that the consumption tax package has, two are most glaring. One is that it will exacerbate the level of unemployment in this country, not cure it. The second is that, according to Department of Finance and Treasury estimates, there is a $3.9 billion shortfall in the estimates that have been presented to the Australian public. It is a shortfall that affects both sides of the ledger. It means that insufficient revenue will be raised on the income side and that, on the costing side, more will be outlaid than is proposed within that package. Therefore, the consumption tax package offers us no hope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The high unemployment aspect of the consumption tax package needs to be stated a little more fully. The proposal by the Opposition is that it will create two million extra jobs by the year 2000. That is based on the high road scenario of the Access Economics-Murphy econometric model of the Australian economy where the projections are based on the full implementation of Industry Commission reforms. This scenario requires an inflation rate&mdash;if one accepts the scenario&mdash;of 12.4 per cent in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one reads Gerard Henderson's column in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald </EMPHASIS>of 10 December, one can see that someone who was the chief of staff of John Howard when he was the Leader of the Opposition and a senior adviser to Malcolm Fraser when he was Prime Minister, someone who is an in-house, big `L' Liberal, believes that the employment scenarios in the consumption tax package are just not true or publicly sustainable. So from within the ranks of the Opposition itself, from one of its more senior bureaucrats, comes ringing condemnation that ought to be heeded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude with these remarks: we have undertaken significant reform in the micro-economy. We are now going through significant labour market reform. The answer to all those reforms rests at the very base of the ability of a government to deliver outcomes in that reform process. I do not think there is any dispute that the need for reform has to go ahead. There is certainly a big dispute in the way in which one goes about it. One does not achieve micro-economic reform on the waterfront by putting the troops in if workers raise reasonable questions about their own future and security. One does not achieve wages policy reform and reform in the labour market by promising, as Dr Hewson has said, to destroy the Australian trade union movement. What one does by taking both those steps in these key and sensitive areas of economic change is bring Australia to confrontation, not to cooperation.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I go quickly through some of the clauses. The first part of the motion mentions increasing employment. Of course, that is the most urgent area of social injustice in Australia at the present time. But to us the words `by reducing business costs, increasing productivity and improving the climate for investment' mean something quite different from what they mean to the Opposition. What the Opposition means by reducing business costs is really to tear the guts out of the agreements which have been built up over many years dealing with fair and equitable treatment for workers. Those opposite want to reduce and remove all those careful protective measures which have been put in place to protect the hard won pay and conditions for workers. That is how they will reduce the business costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite will further reduce the tariffs&mdash;they will tear those away, as Senator Cook has indicated&mdash;to reduce conditions for workers in this country to those of workers in many Third World countries. As far as the much vaunted level playing field that the Opposition talks about is concerned, I remind the Senate that at present we have a multinational company, Nike shoes, in the United States contracting to have made shoes that sell on the international market for $150 by Korean companies, which then subcontract to Indonesian companies which pay workers&mdash;largely women workers&mdash;80c per day for a 12- to 14-hour day. Those are the sorts of work conditions that the Opposition would impose on workers in this country in an attempt to reduce business costs in Australia. </PARA>

The rest will simply not have any choice at all; there will be no education whatsoever available for them under a Fightback package. </PARA>

The vision one gets from both the Opposition and the Government is one in which Australia is simply left to the naked forces of the market&mdash;an unregulated system driven by greed. The motto of the 1980s was, `Greed is good'. That was officially put in place by the Keating treasurership and the Hawke leadership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we hear from Hewson is, `More greed is better'&mdash;they will drive the system harder, further and more vigorously.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the sort of Australia that the Democrats are looking for. The Democrats are looking for a society which moves towards ecological sustainability, which quite deliberately encourages those industries which will move us towards a more sustainable economy and, at the same time, deliver the employment which is necessary and, by addressing the problem of exports and import replacement, address the problem of the massive foreign debt. We believe that that is possible. We believe it is achievable. We believe that there are a number of nascent industries in this country which can be encouraged, which can meet those criteria, and they are the criteria which we believe should be put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short went through the criteria which he said needed to be used as tests by which the Government's economic statement would be measured.

They have no sense whatsoever that Australian society consists of people of flesh and blood with real feelings. They have no sense at all of the need to move Australia towards greater ecological sustainability. For that reason we are seeking the inclusion of those amendments and the deletion of the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly both Senator Short, in speaking to his motion, and Senator Cook, in opposing it, mentioned the Access Economics analysis.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter totally misunderstands the American health system.

One of the biggest problems with the American system is that that insurance is not transportable between occupations or between jobs. Twenty per cent are covered by the American Medicare and Medicaid which are the two systems to care for the poor, the aged and the veterans.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In responding to the matter of urgency today I would like to concentrate on the section which deals with the necessity, in the words of the coalition, to `reduce hospital waiting lists and improve the quality of service in health care'. It is suggested that all of these have been comprehensively addressed by the coalition's Fightback program of reform. After a serious and comprehensive reading of the documents that were issued by the coalition late last year, I find that statement very hard to justify. I would like to detail a few of the miscalculations that are included in that particular package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total national expenditure on health under the Hewson package would rise by $2.113 billion per annum in 1991-92 prices, or about 6 per cent. Commonwealth outlays themselves would rise by $395m, not $37m as the coalition claims, indicating significant omissions by the coalition and conservative assumptions on the part of the departmental costings. The $2 billion increase in global expenditure would be borne largely by individuals' direct costs plus private insurance premiums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Well over one million families would be up to $1,000 per annum worse off, even allowing for tax credits and the safety net. Some 245,000 single people would be up to $500 a year worse off. A family with an annual income of $26,000 will face the additional burden of over $800 a year for private insurance. Families in the $20,000 to $30,000 per annum range will be faced with health insurance fees and large out of pocket costs. They will hardly be comforted by a $200 tax credit, which will nowhere near compensate them for the extra charges they will face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know for a fact that doctors' fees under the coalition plan would inevitably rise. The AMA schedule, which seems to find favour with the coalition, currently averages over 130 per cent of the medical benefits schedule fees, and the floor price will inevitably rise to this level. Charges above this are also totally predictable, and they will not be covered by either gap insurance or safety net provisions. The AMA apparently accepts no constraints on the fees on its schedule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the prospect, under the plans put forward by the coalition, of a great gap in policy making, a great inadequacy. The coalition's policy will do nothing to improve people's access to public or private hospitals. It simply serves as testimony to the fact that the Opposition is hopelessly ignorant of the health insurance system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tax credits for low income earners would not cover the cost of even basic table insurance, let alone provide for private hospital coverage. The daily benefits available under the basic table average $185. Bed day and other charges in private hospitals average twice that&mdash;$335. Even insured patients would have significant out of pocket expenses for admission to private hospitals. Quite obviously, they would continue to use public hospitals. The only guarantee an age pensioner has of free hospital treatment is as a public patient under Medicare. The Opposition would remove that guarantee by luring age pensioners into private insurance by making totally spurious claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a vast amount of uninformed rubbish talked and written about waiting lists&mdash;one of the legs of the urgency motion before us tonight. This totally ignores the fact that waiting lists have always existed for elective surgery, and I am quite sure Senator Herron would confirm that. Elective surgery by its very nature is non-urgent. To be able immediately to schedule such procedures would need a vast structure of beds, resources and personnel that would be idle much of the time. Private hospitals are living testimony to this. They are conducted on this basis. Many such hospitals actually close on weekends and hire staff on a casual basis in order to deal with the peaks and troughs. Public hospitals simply cannot do this. The demands and expectations of public hospitals are entirely different. They are required to be open 24 hours a day and to provide the full range of services for those 24 hours a day seven days a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, however, the coalition's policy is quite off the mark. It gives us nothing to address the fundamental needs of the Australian health system or the needs of the Australian people. It gives us nothing to ensure access to services, especially access for disadvantaged groups such as Aborigines and the chronically ill. It does nothing to improve public hospital facilities and nothing to address waiting times and improve access to hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To try to rectify some of the misleading statements we have been hearing on and off over the years about waiting times I have turned to Issues Paper No. 2 of the Macklin review. There is some very interesting information in Appendix 2 about waiting times for a range of elective surgical procedures in Victoria and South Australia. It is stated in Appendix 2:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aggregate figures for Victoria and South Australia suggest that there is a weak relationship between changes in the number of people treated and the changes in the number of people waiting. Indeed, in some periods, waiting lists grew despite increases in throughput.</PARA>
<PARA>I guess that is bureaucratese for the number of people who have had their elective procedures. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This finding may reflect the commonly observed situation in health care where growth in supply can lead to an expansion of demand, and vice versa. It suggests to policy makers and funders that there should be some caution exercised in interpreting the meaning of waiting lists as an indicator of need, and pursuing patient throughput strategies to reduce waiting lists.</PARA>
<PARA>In contrast, the Government is already setting in motion the recommendations in Issues Paper No. 2 of the Macklin report. I recommend chapter 16 to the coalition as necessary and interesting reading. This chapter is entitled `Core elements of reform to Australia's hospital system'. I might add that it is the result of painstaking research, consultation and policy development in conjunction with the States and Territories, which of course is inevitable. Chapter 16 summarises measures such as the development and introduction of area health management responsible for broadly defined health services; equitable funding of geographic areas, using population-based resource allocation models; a price mechanism for funding both public and private hospitals using case mix as a measure of output; and the development of strategic hospital plans, a judicious restriction of bed supply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other measures of importance in the better utilisation of existing facilities include State-wide management of waiting lists for elective surgery&mdash;a very sensible approach; improved productivity of public hospitals; improved information systems for both providers and clients; and resolution of Commonwealth-State roles and responsibilities. In other words, it is a comprehensive approach to improve accessibility, efficiency and effectiveness in hospital systems, which are, after all, primarily the responsibility of the States. Of course, there is also the examination of the close relationship of public hospitals to all those other services which are of so much importance in planning for the necessary number of beds and resources&mdash;nursing homes, hostels, home and community care and mental health services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addressing this subject this evening I would also like to go to a very important initiative of the Government which was announced late last year and which is meeting with a great deal of enthusiasm amongst the general practitioner population. I refer to the introduction of demonstration practice grants, the purpose being to foster new ideas for the funding and delivery of general practice services. Over 800 applications have been received and acknowledged in the short time since the announcement of this new program. Some of those applications are from large groups of GPs. The total number of GPs involved is substantially larger than 800. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Applications are now being considered by a panel comprising a representative of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, a departmental officer, and a general practitioner independent of both the Department and the College. Announcement of successful applicants is expected to commence in March and April. I understand that the AMA has been very critical about its omission from the panel. The fact of the matter is that the AMA was initially offered a position on the panel but rejected that offer. So the claim that it has been omitted is quite mischievous in view of the fact that it dismissed the Government's offer when it was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The demonstration grants are intended to include, but are not limited to, enhanced continuity of care through the provision of after-hours, home and off-site consultations by general practice doctors and the development of better links between general practitioners and other providers such as hospitals and allied skill workers. Another range of uses is the provision of a greater variety of primary health care services such as group and personal health promotion and disease preventative services and allied health care. Where do we get any emphasis at all on preventative health in the Fightback program? It ignores the actual needs of individuals and goes to a whole lot of totally spurious changes such as those in the taxation system which will benefit nobody except perhaps some medical practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other possibilities under the demonstration grants are practice consolidation to encourage the formation of clinically and economically viable practices or cooperation between GPs, community health services and hospitals, a larger range of appropriately qualified practice staff, practice nurses, practice-based community nurses, other allied health professionals, and practice managers to complement the work of the general practitioners and to promote greater efficiency, and improving and continuing education and training for all practice staff and participation in the training of medical students and/or family medicine program trainees. These are all totally praiseworthy and legitimate projects within a program which obviously appeals very strongly to those general practitioners who wish to provide for their clients a range of services which is beyond the usual narrow general practitioner service. The applications are being assessed currently and the grants to the successful applicants will be announced quite soon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear from what I have said today that we in the Government are looking ahead and have been doing so for some time. The reason that we needed an inquiry into hospital services in Australia was not that our hospital system was on the point of disintegration; it was that there were inadequacies and we could see that there were ways of changing and of improving and wanted to make sure it was done in the correct way. Rejigging the health system to make it a matter of private responsibility for individuals&mdash;many of whom simply cannot afford it&mdash;seems to me a totally specious and superficial way of approaching the whole question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To come back to the demonstration grant as another example of the way in which we hope to go, special consideration will be given to applications targeting areas currently underserviced&mdash;that is, rural and remote areas&mdash;or providing services catering to the special needs of areas with high numbers of disadvantaged groups, such as, for example, homeless youth, unemployed people, those with AIDS and so on. Our plans are targeted, they are well thought through and they are the result, as I said earlier, of a great deal of consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To conclude, if the Opposition was truly concerned for the health of the Australian people, it would not be advocating the introduction of a totally new taxation system of which it is said by Mr Dwyer, an economic consultant with the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission, that there should be suspicions of any tax reform package which claimed that there were no losers. We cannot all be winners. Initial losers would be those who spent more of their income than average on consumption, such as families, the very people who are the widest users of any health system. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The most recent example of his failure to understand the problem, let alone address it, was the reversal of the decision to introduce patient co-payment of medical fees. The original decision was quite correctly based on the need to take urgent action on the burgeoning cost of health care. The reversal of the decision had everything to do with who should be leader of the Government and nothing to do with the delivery of health care. To quote the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, Mr Howe, on 20 August 1991, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major problem facing Australia's health care system is the growth in use of medical services per person. This growth means that every 20 years the number of medical services per person doubles.</PARA>

Senator Giles referred to it and misrepresented our policy in relation to preventative health care. The largest single preventative measure that could be achieved in this country would be to influence the consumption of cigarettes.

There are now over 24,000 people, with 20 per cent waiting six months or more. These figures are paralleled in other States. Furthermore, I am aware that in at least one State, there have been selected delays in more expensive surgery such as joint replacements because of fiscal constraints. Waiting lists, however, are blunt measures of failure. Like icebergs, they are only the tip of the problem, but they are visible. Less visible are the more fundamental problems. </PARA>

It represents and reflects the increasing number of doctors&mdash;there has been a 50 per cent increase in the last 10 years&mdash;the increase in unit labour costs, the maldistribution of health personnel; the gap between Medicare fees and Medicare refund; the increasing demand for nursing home beds; the increasing number of pensioners, going from 2.9 million to 3.8 million, an increase of 22 per cent in the last five years; the demand for screening; the increasing costs for the public hospital sector, increasing at 12 per cent per annum; and the cost shifting between State and Federal Governments in relation to pharmaceuticals, outpatients and billings. </PARA>

For too long, Australia's provision of health services has been stunted by a system that has reduced individual and family responsibility, damaged the professional standing and sense of fulfilment of doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, administrators and other health workers, and threatened the reputation for excellence of Australia's hospitals. Changing the system into one more responsive to human needs and less reliant on government is a massive task. As in so many areas of Australian society, it involves fundamental reform at many levels.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the third part of this motion, there is no doubt in the minds of most Australians that the Government needs to take urgent action to expand resources and provide greater choice and higher standards in education. Only through education can Australia thrive and become the truly great nation that it has the potential to be. It is ironic, therefore, that a government that purports to fight for social justice and which has continually stated the need for a clever country has neglected education in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Labor Government our education standards have deteriorated to the extent that, in 1992, 50,000 eligible students cannot obtain easy entry to a university and approximately 150,000 students will be locked out of TAFE positions. This is not social justice and it certainly does not lead to the creation of a clever country. The decay of the Australian education system must be turned around and only a coalition government is capable of doing this through the Fightback program of reform that will expand resources and provide greater choice and higher standards in education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all areas of education in Australia the Labor Government has failed. It has failed to recognise the vital importance of this sector; it has failed to provide adequate resources to the sector; and it has failed to give the education sector the freedom to flourish. Mr Keating failed to realise when he forced upon us the worst recession in 60 years that it was naturally going to increase the demand for tertiary places as unemployment skyrocketed to a post-war high of 10.6 per cent. Despite the overwhelming demand, the Labor Government continues to neglect this sector. This is best illustrated by the Government's inability to adequately fund tertiary places to meet demand and, with its outdated ideology, the Government refuses to give back to the university the freedom to offer additional places to students who could get private sector funding. The present Government was warned by the Industry Commission in the middle of last year of the gross unfairness to Australian students that was being caused by its policies, and it has still failed to act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education and training are amongst the most important investments any country can make. In Australia this year we are seeing the tragic consequences of the Government's failure to give post-school training the importance it deserves. The only solution to this crisis is a change of government and the immediate implementation of the Fightback reform package. Education and training will have a vital place within the program of reform of the first Hewson government. Australia's long term future will be guaranteed only if the knowledge and skills of Australians are equal to the world's best. Our education and training policies are an integral part of our strategy to provide soundly based job opportunities and improve the quality of life for all Australians this decade. Our schools, training institutions and universities must encourage a desire for learning, the pursuit of excellence and ensure that Australians are fully prepared for the challenges of a changing and highly competitive world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will raise the standard of Australian education and training to international levels and make Australia a leading provider of education and training services. The level of skills in Australia's work force is a key to determining our international competitiveness. Australia is lagging behind its main competitors. At a time of historically high unemployment, such as is now being experienced, training and retraining have a crucial role to play in maximising job opportunities for those currently out of work and for laying the foundations and basis for economic growth in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Finn report on post-compulsory education found that Australia fell short of best international practice with regard to this type of education. The report stated that Australia will need to pay greater regard to rapid development in competitor nations if we are to maintain or improve our performance relative to best international practice. It is important, therefore, that the goals of education and training relate not only to participation programs but also to standards of attainment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the year 2001, at least 50 per cent of people up to the age of 22 should have obtained at least a vocational certificate or a diploma or a degree, and this has to be done if we are to have a world class system. While TAFE is generally the responsibility of the States, the Federal Government has the responsibility to ensure that in the national interest there is a high level of skill in our work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Labor Government has taken some initiatives in recent times, it has never adopted a comprehensive strategy for raising the level of skills in Australia to an international level. Its ideology of centralist control and support of excessive union power has consistently distorted its approach. If we are ever to achieve excellence in education and training, we must break down the monopolies that we have in the bureaucracy and the unions, devolve responsibility and encourage competition and choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Training policy must be integrated fully with an overall education policy encompassing schools, industry training, tertiary education in all its forms and private as well as public education provision. By the same token, training cannot be left to the unstructured hit and miss methods of the past. We must set national goals which embrace the needs of industry and commerce for specific training, and meet those goals with a combination of flexible and highly qualified provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry has a key role in the provision of skills, either through enterprise based training or through the use of external trainers, both private and TAFE. Industry should meet the cost of such training. Industry also has a vital role to play through links with all levels of education, ensuring that these providers are aware of the significance of the workplace for their curriculum. TAFE has a central role in lifting the levels of skills of Australians. It is the largest provider of post-school education and has a particular role in relation to the upgrading of adult skills and providing courses for disadvantaged groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are serious structural problems in TAFE arising from the rigidities imposed by the centralised administration and industrial relations arrangements applying within the TAFE system. Above all, TAFE must be flexible and responsive to the needs of local industry and be able to provide the training courses which industry requires. TAFE's primary role is to provide high quality entry level training and advanced training for industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Total TAFE enrolments grew steadily throughout the 1980s but declined in 1989 and 1990 and now, in 1992, we have 150,000 students unable to obtain entry to a TAFE course. This is completely unacceptable in a modern industrial society and reflects the needs to ensure adequate funding for TAFE and proper recognition of its key role in the national training systems in accordance with the recommendations of the Finn report that I alluded to earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In stark contrast to the Labor Government's policy of neglect, the Liberal and National parties will work with the States and Territories to ensure greater freedom for TAFE institutions to respond to the needs of their local communities and to rationalise fee paying arrangements. In resourcing TAFE, institutions should be encouraged to expand resources raised from fee for service and other activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that for TAFE to perform its vital role, structural reform of the TAFE system is essential. Therefore, we will ensure that TAFE has greater autonomy in relation to staffing and conditions of employment, a high level of independence for TAFE directors and boards and the ability to charge fees where appropriate. Recognising the key role of TAFE in the national training arrangements, the coalition will ensure that the growth of TAFE is adequately supported and, to this end, undertakes to increase funding by $75m a year above current commitments, or $450m to fund growth in TAFE over the remaining years of this decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the Labor Government, the Fightback program's primary objective for higher education is a university system of world class standard, providing the diversity of opportunity required to meet the diversity of student needs. There must be places in the universities for all students with the capacity to pursue higher education, and no student should be prevented from undertaking higher education on financial grounds alone. The key role of the universities as the primary location of basic research effort needs to be strengthened. Under the Labor Government our universities have suffered a drain of academics of world class standard, chronic overcrowding in lectures and tutorials and the disgraceful statistic of 50,000 eligible students unable to obtain entry to a tertiary institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Government has also destroyed any basis for institutional autonomy that the universities of Australia once had. The establishment of the national unified system by the former Minister for Education, Employment and Training has created a system of higher education which is directed by political and bureaucratic discretion. Resource allocation is highly centralised and institutions are tightly regulated with respect to their student numbers and course offerings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Labor Government, a narrow agenda was imposed on universities which were seen as adjuncts to the economy. There has been no appreciation of the breadth of their role and contribution to knowledge and society. The fundamental weakness of the present system is that there is excessive reliance on centralised direction and regulation in an attempt to improve efficiency in teaching and research. Institutions are operating under significant bureaucratic interference. Financial constraints, rigidities of centralised industrial relations, centrally coordinated institutional profiles, restrictions on the development of new programs and on student admissions all serve as barriers to efficiency and to adaptations to the demands of the student market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic research efforts of the universities have been disrupted by ad hoc decision making and by the damaging clawback of funds from the operating grants for redistribution through the Australian Research Council. Researchers have lost a large part of their decision making autonomy and the central role of intellectual inquiry and creativity has been undermined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems being faced by Australian higher education at the present time are the characteristic symptoms to be expected from a centrally regulated system. The appropriate strategy to correct them is a significant deregulation of higher education and greater exposure of students and institutions to market signals. This strategy is a part of the Fightback reform program and should therefore be adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition in its Fightback strategy has developed strong incentives to promote excellence. Government regulation and imposed uniformity stifles initiative and diversity and leads to mediocrity. A genuinely competitive framework for higher education will allow each institution to develop in its own way. Freedom for institutions, academics and students requires a decisive move away from a centrally administered system to one based on a greatly strengthened student market in which students can choose their university according to their own judgment, and institutions have the flexibility to respond to these choices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we are all aware, Australia's education sector has been led to disaster by this Labor Government. There are not enough resources at a time when the Government is indirectly forcing record numbers of people off the dole queues and into our universities and TAFE colleges. This has created massive overcrowding and record numbers of young people are missing out on higher and further education. This is an appalling situation. It has been addressed by the recommendations of the Finn report which demands much more emphasis on post-compulsory education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, through the centralised system introduced by Mr Dawkins, the education sector has been reduced to one of conformity and an arm of Government policy. The result has been one of low morale, dropping standards and academics leaving for the private sector. The only way to redress this is for the policies outlined in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> to be adopted. With the better resources, greater choice and higher standards that the Fightback package will provide, the education sector can lead Australia to the competitive edge of the international economy. </PARA>

It is those who consider that education is socially a liberating experience for many people who otherwise would never have been able to fulfil all of their potential. It is those who think that education is a way of making society work because it gives people a chance, it teaches them tolerance and it teaches them to fulfil their personal ambitions.

Of course, his party was not all that interested in that issue. One need only look at the way the Liberal Party ranked its Cabinet in that period. It was pretty obvious that education did not count for too much in terms of the hierarchy of Liberal government Cabinets and Ministries before Whitlam turned up on the scene.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That in itself was the message to the Australian community which I believe all of us took up. Senator Tierney may well be right in some of the technical comments and criticisms he has made about the way we are moving at the moment, but the one thing he cannot deny is the fact that the Labor Party has put a value on education far higher, far greater than any government ever did before us. In other words, Whitlam started it and when we got back into government we continued it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had my debates, discussions and disagreements with Minister Dawkins. Nobody in this place denies that. I do not deny it in the Party room. It has been a healthy disagreement. I have said, `Bureaucrats have too much influence. They are unimaginative; they are not outward looking. You accept their advice too often'. I have said that. I believe that at the end of the day we have come to an arrangement&mdash;an agreement&mdash;about where we should be going, and I believe that the bureaucrats have been put in their place on many occasions. There are other areas where I have lost completely, and Senator Tierney, I think, would be very well aware of those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that education has now been put on the agenda. It has been put on the agenda by a Labor Government&mdash;a Labor Government which has convinced people that we have to spend money; we have to increase our expenditure; and we have to put an emphasis on education, because education and training is an area where the future of Australia, our competitiveness, is going to be decided. It will not be decided by the 26-year-old who sits in front of the VDU and says, `Let's move the Australian dollar up a point or two'. Those people come and go. In a sense, they are restricted already by Australian government policy. What will count is how we train our young people for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can go through all the details, and I will leave those until a later debate because I will be quite happy to debate this whole question of educational funding and educational policy in this chamber, but I do not want to do it in 12 minutes. I do not think that is of any value to either this chamber or to the Australian public. What I want to do today is put on the record what we have done in terms of emphasising the importance of education in this community and, if we have done it and Opposition senators are prepared to either back us or take it further, then we would pat them on the back. The simple fact is, education is now on the agenda and we have done it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating today the report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia and North-East Asia in the 1990s: Accelerating Change</EMPHASIS> prepared by the East Asia Analytical Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The importance of the north-east Asian region to Australia can hardly be overstated. It must be cause for regret that this report will receive a maximum of only half an hour's consideration, with five minutes allocated to each speaker.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of this region to Australia can be gauged from the trade figures with that region. Over 40 per cent of Australia's  merchandise exports go to the region and almost 30 per cent of our imports come from it. Japan alone amounts to almost 30 per cent of Australia's merchandise exports and supplies 20 per cent of imports. It is also the single most important market for education exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see quite clearly from the region and its development that there has been a massive shift in that region, exemplified by Japan in particular, towards high-tech industries. Japan has now consolidated its position with products which require high levels of skill, knowledge and sophisticated technology. Indeed, high value service industries are now growing rapidly as incomes rise. The other nations in that group, notably the Republic of Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, are now in the position in which Japan found itself a decade or so ago and they are moving very quickly up the ladder in this shift towards high-tech industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at this development one realises that the expenditure in any one nation on research and development is perhaps the single most important factor. We note from page 3 of the report that in Japan, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, government research and development expenditure has been increasing by around 15 per cent a year and private sector research and development expenditure at an even higher rate. When we compare that with the Australian situation, where we barely keep pace at a much lower level and there is no notable increase, I believe we have some cause for concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development showed Japanese expenditure on research and development at the level of 2.85 per cent of GDP. Compared with that figure, Australia stands at 1.23 per cent of GDP&mdash;less than half and almost a third. But the most important and worrying factor is that in the past five years we have been at that level and no increases have been recorded. We must realise, therefore, that there are certain policy challenges for Australia, particularly in developing our high technology manufacturing industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report makes a number of other recommendations, some of which are fairly obvious and general. The report recommends that we should develop a more competitive economy; that we should achieve better coordination between the public and private sectors; that we should have stronger multilateral and bilateral trading systems; that we should express support for Asia-Pacific e<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>conomic cooperation, and so on. There are others which require comment and a different emphasis or even qualified dissent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a question that I put earlier today to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) asking him to indicate what assistance Australian manufacturing industries will be receiving from the Government in overcoming the barriers which are present in these north-east Asian countries and in other areas of our region. It was clear&mdash;and it is confirmed by this report&mdash;that no such assistance will be forthcoming. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address some aspects of the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia and North-East Asia in the 1990s: Accelerating Change</EMPHASIS>. There is little about which one can argue in terms of the summary of conclusions in the report. I have not had the opportunity to read all aspects of the report as yet and it will require considerable study to analyse it all. I refer to the conclusion in the report relating to policy changes, which states that it will be important for Australia to continue to pursue sound macro-economic policies, micro-economic reform and improvements in international competitiveness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have just listened to a debate led by Senator Short and others from our side regarding the changes we need in Australia at this time. It is particularly fitting that the report should be brought down at this time, some 24 hours before a statement from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) concerning the future of Australia&mdash;albeit that it is at the end of a long line of statements similar to this one or with the same name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to emphasise some points that are very important in terms of our international competitiveness. The first is the necessity, if we are to be competitive with the Asian region, to maximise what is happening in Asia. While there is a lot of emphasis on Japan, from what I have read of this report so far it is also worth noting that in Asia we have an economy the size of Japan's growing about every 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this report refers to North East Asia, it is crucial that in tomorrow's economic statement such impediments on business as the wholesale sales tax, fuel excise, payroll tax and a number of other development impediments to maximising opportunities in Asia be considered seriously. Their removal would give business the ability to maximise the potential that exists in Asia and would allow the horrific levels of unemployment we have now in this country to be addressed in a meaningful, long term manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report mentions micro-economic reform, which includes the waterfront, transport and aspects of our export regulations under AQIS. On those aspects of our policy position, I emphasise that, even though there have been reported massive changes on the waterfront, which have been at significant cost to the Australian taxpayer and the people operating on it, I have yet to have an industry say to me that the cost of getting goods across the waterfront has decreased. </PARA>

In export regulation, there are still massive inefficiencies, there is still massive overemployment, and there are costs and restrictions which impact on our ability to penetrate the north-east Asian market.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak very briefly on this matter. It is something that needs a lot more than five minutes to deal with. I have read the report briefly, but what prompted me to get to my feet was the sheer hypocrisy of what the Australian Democrats said. As Senator Spindler said, our future lies in South East Asia and with the north-east Asian countries such as Japan, Taiwan, Korea and so on. But if ever people have gone out of their way to deter trade from that area it is people such as Senator Spindler and Mrs Kelly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only last week in the Brisbane <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier Mail</EMPHASIS> an article stated that the Japanese were going to put money into infrastructure on the west coast of the United States so that they could increase their purchases of coal from the United States and thus have a lesser reliance on Australia. It so happened that I had arranged on that day to have lunch with some old Japanese friends from one of the major trading companies with whom I had dealt over the past 20 years but with whom I do not deal today. I asked them whether the remarks of the Democrats and Mrs Kelly about carbon taxes and the reduction of CO(2) levels to unachievable figures had affected the Japanese thinking in any way. They said, `Of course it does'. It is not a major issue at this stage, but it is just another little nail in the coffin where the Japanese, who rely entirely on resources for their continued existence&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What an amazing remark. We have the Democrats on the one hand talking about increasing trade&mdash;I just heard Senator Spindler say it&mdash;and on the other hand Senator Coulter saying what an amazingly bad record the Japanese have. The Japanese have had incredible growth and we have benefited from that growth. This report enhances the view of what has been happening over the past 20 years. Certainly, Japan had problems because of its high growth rates, but if ever a country has addressed those problems it is Japan. The Democrats should recognise this when it occurs, instead of sitting back criticising and doing their damnedest to help destroy the trade we enjoy and thus our standard of living. For goodness sake, get out of the bottom of the garden and be real. That is a fact. If the Democrats do not want us to trade with Japan, they should go on the way they are. We are not the only supplier of materials to that country. Many other countries would be happy to take our place and are waiting in the queue to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also noted the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in Darwin when he suggested that the Japanese should apologise for what happened 50 years ago. I was offended by that. I suffered from what happened in the Second World War. My father was the first Australian killed in New Guinea, but neither my family nor myself want the Japanese to apologise publicly. Casting the sins of the parents back on the children is an utter nonsense, and it is something that is preoccupying this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That remark also stunned my Japanese friends.

<PARA>I have two purposes in speaking to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Training for Aboriginals Program&mdash;Review</EMPHASIS>. First, of course, it is an excellent review which will provide a lot of material for policy development. I particularly want to pay tribute to the author of the report, Elliott Johnston, QC, who, as we know, has made an inestimable contribution to the sum of knowledge and informed debate on questions fundamental to the well-being and status of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, having completed his term with the Royal Commission inquiry which he headed for much of its duration. The Commission reported about half way through last year and Mr Johnston then commenced work on this particular review, which was completed by the end of the year and which, once again, provides us with a great deal of information and direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is impossible for me in these few minutes to summarise the wide range of recommendations that are made as a result of the review, but I would like to draw the Senate's attention to just two or three issues which are highlighted in this program. One of the fundamental questions faced by Mr Johnston was whether the training for Aboriginals program is for training or for employment. He very firmly came down on the side of its being a training program operating within the Aboriginal employment development program. This issue was in need of clarification in view of existing guidelines which were somewhat confusing for the personnel involved. At paragraph 3.27 of this report, Mr Johnston expresses the view that TAP is for training on three broad grounds, the most important of which is that it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . is the best way in which Aboriginal people, disadvantaged by history, by poor educational outcomes, by little or no work experience, by absence of capital reserves, by absence of entry into jobs by way of family or friendships with non-Aboriginal business people and by prejudice can in fact enter the employment field (using that word as above).</PARA>
<PARA>That is a direct quote from the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also draws attention to special needs groups, and these he details as youth, women and prisoners. Referring to the final report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which focused on the particular needs of those involved in the criminal justice system, he then makes recommendations for education and training within that justice system and reiterates much of what was said in the report of the Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He refers also to the particularly disadvantaged group of Aboriginal women, emphasising that they have a much lower labour force participation rate than Aboriginal men. He suggests that one way in which programs can be tailored more to the needs of women is to widen the concept of employment to include part time employment. He emphasises that there is a high ratio of young people and children to adults among the Aboriginal population and that many women, although they wish to return to work, cannot do so on a full time basis. He goes on to say, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the high present unemployment rate, I think it is highly desirable that part-time work be encouraged by providing subsidy and training assistance for part-time positions just as it is provided for full-time ones&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>There is provision for this in the TAP manual. Another reference to women comes right at the end of the report where he suggests that the enterprise employment assistance program be extended so as to be a cost neutral benefit made available to Aboriginal incorporated organisations wishing to avail themselves of the benefit&mdash;once again, a scheme which `might be particularly useful for women with families for whom full time work is often quite unsuitable'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the report to the Senate and to all people who are concerned about the high unemployment rate among Aboriginals, the lack of employment opportunities for them and the enormous enhancement which will come with education and training for employment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I congratulate the Australian Wheat Board on its annual report for the year 1990-91 and on the work it does in trying to maximise the net returns to Australian wheat growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are looking for a critical year for Australia's wheat growers, then the period covered by this report would be it. It is obvious when reading the report that the year provided the Australian Wheat Board with one of the toughest marketing environments in recent years. It had to cope with record world wheat production, export subsidies at record levels, a static import demand and low world prices. It is sad to read that some growers suffered the same fate that many others involved in Australia's rural industries have suffered over the past few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report notes that `some growers were unable to withstand the substantial decline in wheat returns while the livelihood of many others has been threatened'. I note from page 2 of the Chairman's report that the AWB's focus in the period was, therefore, to try to minimise the impact of this world situation on growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1990-91 marketing year was a turning point for the international wheat market. A record level of world wheat production combined with increased, aggressive use of export subsidies forced prices lower. The Chairman reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AWB continues to be dismayed that the United States and the European Community persist in using export subsidies which artificially lower prices and distort world trade patterns.</PARA>
<PARA>He also noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pressure on these countries to reduce their subsidies must be maintained&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and that, therefore, the Board&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">supports the Australian Government's position in the Uruguay General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade round (GATT).</PARA>
<PARA>He said further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A successful outcome of the Uruguay round should yield meaningful and lasting trade reforms to the benefit of the Australian grain industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, the Chairman reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">World grain trade is likely to be increasingly dominated by the availability of government-backed credit, combined with the use of export subsidies. This will place pressure on Australia's ability to compete with the credit terms offered by other major exporters.</PARA>
<PARA>I have heard many speakers in the Senate and in the media argue about the merits of free trade and the abolition of tariffs, but I have yet to see any significant benefits flow to our rural sector. Only hardship seems to be the end result. Australia has been building its tariff policy around its commitment to the Uruguay round of GATT. We are told that it is necessary for Australia to reduce its tariff barriers to demonstrate our good faith at GATT and to encourage the larger, more powerful nations to demonstrate that they will follow our lead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it seems to me that this philosophy is not working. The EC and other countries have failed to respond to any of the initiatives taken by Australia and other trading nations. This came under the spotlight in the Senate last year when we addressed the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. In that debate the Government outlined how it intended to set what it calls a level playing field for the motor vehicle industry, the textiles, clothing and footwear industry, the vegetable industry and the sugar industry. What concerns me greatly is that it did this without regard to the impact of its policies on the competitive conditions under which producers in each of those industries work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In following this policy, what we are really saying is that, because we are on the altar of free trade, because we want to be able to hold our hands on our hearts and say to the Europeans, the Americans and the Japanese that we are acting as we believe they should act, we will be in a better position to ensure that they do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, in doing so, we place a number of our major industries in a position where there will be even more unemployed, where there will be an even larger number engaged in those industries who will be shutting up plant and moving offshore and where, in many rural sectors, we will find that imports will take over their market share. Reductions of tariffs in these areas, as some sort of grand gesture, while they are not being matched by our trading competitors&mdash;and I emphasise that&mdash;is a warm inner glow nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, no-one can ignore the impact of all the arguments and evidence about the effects of this tariff war on Australian farmers put to the President of the United States when he was here in January. George Bush simply indicated that his job was to protect American farmers first and not leave them to the mercies of such trade wars. I ask honourable senators why this Government does not do the same for our own people instead of, in effect, selling them down the chute. What makes it even more criminal is that we are doing so after people have committed their life savings in what has been a very economically difficult time. </PARA>

However, I have only one minute in which to do so. The annual report shows the result of two years in which the new deregulated domestic market has operated. I am still looking for the benefits of the deregulated domestic market. From what I have seen, the deregulated domestic market has simply allowed the Australian millers, the Australian poultry feeders and the Australian stock feeders to pick the eyes out of the market for a simple $2 to $5 per ton premium.

<PARA>The review by the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration of the office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman was the first significant external review of the office in its 15 years of existence. The Committee undertook the inquiry at the request of the former Prime Minister following a suggestion made by the former Ombudsman, Professor Denis Pearce, shortly before his retirement. The inquiry was prompted by the concerns of Professor Pearce and his predecessors about the Ombudsman's resources and aimed to review the powers, jurisdiction and performance of the office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ombudsman is generally seen as part of the administrative law system. It might therefore have seemed appropriate for any review of the office to have a legal orientation. But administrative law, by definition, affects administration and this Committee was concerned more with the impact of the Ombudsman's office than with the professional discipline within which it operates. The Committee's review was explicitly conducted from a public administration rather than a legal standpoint and concluded that the Ombudsman has made a positive contribution to Australian administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nature of that contribution and of the role that should be assigned to the Ombudsman was the subject of controversy during the inquiry. The report reviews in some detail the development of the ombudsman institution, drawing out a longstanding tension between two broad concepts of the office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the remainder of my remarks in this tabling statement about the Ombudsman's role and some more detailed comments about the recommendations of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Ombudsman's role</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One view of the Ombudsman holds that the office is a central link in the legal system of administrative review, a reviewer of the whole system of administration and a defender of the citizen's rights. A less ambitious but no less important possible role is in the resolution of individual complaints, many concerning simple errors or misunderstandings which offer no lessons for the administrative system, although these issues may be very important to those raising them. The contrast between the two roles has been illustrated with the metaphor of "lion hunting" versus "fly swatting".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The original proposal for a Commonwealth Ombudsman, advanced by the Kerr Committee in 1971, clearly envisaged a lion hunter. However, the detailed blueprint for the Office, contained in the Bland Report of 1973 provided specifications better suited to a fly swatter and that approach has been adopted or endorsed by successive governments. Despite lingering support for a lion-hunting role in some of the evidence to the Committee, the Ombudsman is settled in a role that is oriented primarily towards resolving large numbers of relatively minor complaints.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report stresses that this is not an ignoble or unimportant function and the fly swatting/lion hunting metaphor may mislead. Errors and misunderstandings affecting individuals can have little significance for the overall system of administration but still be very important to the persons concerned. The Ombudsman provides a check on the unique powers and functions of government which can be of enormous significance to individuals. As a cheap, accessible remedy for people who are in dispute with government bodies, the Ombudsman contributes in a major way to equity in our society. This should be treasured at a time when so many other aspects of equity and social justice, and even the need for those qualities, are under attack.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The survival of the Ombudsman in an era when equity is unfashionable may owe something to the Ombudsman's value in promoting efficiency. Providing a voice to aggrieved clients is one of the cheapest and most efficient ways of monitoring the performance of large organisations. Witnesses from several GBEs echoed the sentiments of Telecom's corporate secretary, who told the Committee "the Ombudsman has added value to our operations" (Report, p. 42). The spread of the ombudsman institution to the private sector in the form of the Banking Industry Ombudsman supports that judgement and provides a commendable model of the private sector learning good management from the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendations</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Acknowledging the Ombudsman's contribution to equity and efficiency, the Committee made 31 recommendations for improvement. The first, recognising that the Ombudsman's main contribution is to administration rather than to law, was that the Government consider candidates from non-legal backgrounds as well as lawyers when future appointments are made to the office. The other recommendations fall into five broad groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>Firstly, the Committee believes that all Commonwealth bodies should fall within the Ombudsman's jurisdiction unless specifically excluded for stated reasons (Report, p. 43). This reverses the present situation and would bring into the Ombudsman's jurisdiction the administrative decisions of court and tribunal registries, the parliamentary departments, and a wide range of statutory bodies and government companies. A related proposal would extend the Ombudsman's jurisdiction to employment-related complaints which are currently covered for only some Commonwealth bodies by the Merit Protection and Review Agency. The Committee also recommended that the Government consider giving the Commonwealth Ombudsman responsibility for ombudsman-type functions proposed for industries such as telecommunications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A second group of recommendations concerned complaints about Police and other major complaints. The Ombudsman is responsible for reviewing the files on internal investigations of complaints about police and may also investigate these complaints independently. However, only one independent investigation has been undertaken in the last ten years and there have been long delays in the review of files. The Committee could not regard this situation as acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee proposed that either funds be found to provide an acceptable level of review of police complaints or the function be removed from the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman and the Government together should face up to the inadequacies of the present system and devise suitable remedies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Complaints about police are different in kind from the bulk of the Ombudsman's work. These and a handful of other complaints, such as those raising possible fraud or illegal behaviour,  require formal investigation rather than informal fact finding and conciliation. They need to be resolved promptly. Recognising the qualitative difference between the few serious complaints, including those about police, and the bulk of the Ombudsman's work, the Committee recommended that the Ombudsman establish a separate investigation unit to handle major complaints.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also considered the issue of the Ombudsman's relationship with Parliament. The recommendations in this area seek to retain the Ombudsman's statutory independence while strengthening the links between the office and Parliament. The most important proposal in this regard is for the Senate and House of Representatives Committees on Finance and Public Administration to meet jointly with the Ombudsman twice each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further group of recommendations aim to have the Ombudsman's existence and functions promoted more actively, with the promotion being targeted to low income and disadvantaged groups. The Committee also proposed that the Ombudsman actively seek to improve and encourage internal complaints-handling mechanisms in government departments and agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its recommendations concerning the management of the Ombudsman's Office, the Committee mainly sought to encourage the secondment of some public servants to the Ombudsman's Office and an appropriate level of lateral recruitment to the Office. The Committee rejected the idea of charging for the Ombudsman's services as inequitable and impractical, and was supported in that conclusion by the Department of Finance. However, the report suggests that departments or agencies which are subject to a high level of complaints could be required to fund the secondment of suitable staff to the Ombudsman's Office.</PARA>

<PARA>On 7 November 1991 the Senate referred to the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs for inquiry and report the reference, `A National Drought Policy: Appropriate Government responses to the recommendations of the Drought Policy Review Task Force'. This task force, of course, was a specialist and non-political or non-parliamentary task force. During the last two months the Rural and Regional Affairs Committee has undertaken an extensive program of hearings and inspections in several States in order to gauge responses to the 58 recommendations made in the report of the Drought Policy Review Task Force published in 1990. The Committee  undertook an extensive program of hearings, holding them in 14 centres, mostly rural towns, and hearing evidence from over 160 witnesses. This first report on a national drought policy records many of the concerns and issues raised by these witnesses. We did give an opportunity to the audiences at these hearings to make short statements on their experiences of drought. Although that was quite new to the process of the Committee, it was very much appreciated by those people in the rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Chairman of the Committee, I am particularly pleased that this first report was available to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) and his State and Territory counterparts before the meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council, convened on 14 February 1992 to consider the principles for a national drought policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's report records several general conclusions relating to a national drought policy and programs to manage for drought. For example, the Committee endorses the concept of self-reliance in relation to drought management. Many witnesses told the Committee that the best drought policy is one which places the utmost reliance on the farmers' own provision for drought. In this regard, the view is often expressed to the Committee that farmers are basically looking to be self-reliant and that they are not looking for handouts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of this self-reliant approach, the Committee was told that farmers and graziers must be provided with incentives to prepare for drought. Two measures to encourage self-reliance received considerable comment. These are: an income equalisation deposits scheme; and taxation arrangements relating to storage facilities for hay, grain and fodder and plant or structural improvements for conserving or conveying water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is of the view that there is a need for an effective income equalisation deposits scheme that will encourage a self-reliant approach to farm management. The Committee also considers that, in regard to taxation arrangements, evidence for a shorter period of depreciation for storage and other facilities is persuasive, specifically when this is directed towards drought proofing of rural properties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that the Committee did consider, and properly so, that there are two aspects to preparing for drought and the resultant assistance that must be given to farmers who are in very bad circumstances. Firstly, of course, one does not want to see farmers disappear from the industry because they have not been able to manage in such conditions. Secondly, there is also concern about the national interest: that it is very important to have in place appropriate arrangements to enable farmers to provide produce for the population of Australia as well as generate quite a large amount of our export earnings. So I guess one aspect related to the self-preservation of the farmer and the second related to community interest in general. Of course, both of those issues must be thought through and provided for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the concept of self-reliance received overwhelming support, it was suggested to the Committee that a self-reliant approach to drought cannot protect rural producers from extreme droughts which, statistically, might be expected to occur once or twice in a farmer's working life. It was argued that in these instances only the Commonwealth has the resources to provide such assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although advocating a greater role for the Commonwealth in situations of extreme drought, witnesses had difficulty in defining `extreme drought' and identifying appropriate trigger mechanisms for the provision of assistance from the Commonwealth. The Committee also heard differing views on how such assistance should be provided. For example, some witnesses suggested changes to the ratio of Commonwealth and State contributions to Part B of the rural adjustment scheme, or RAS as it is known. Other people advocated more direct relief by the reinstatement of Commonwealth assistance through transport subsidies for producers affected by extreme drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were left in no doubt, as a result of all the evidence given to us and the obvious sincerity of those people who indicated that they were in difficulty, that the rural adjustment scheme needs adjustment, that it is not working in the way in which it was intended to work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to that interjection I say that it is not hopeless. But it is not appropriate; it does need adjustment. On the basis of the evidence presented to the inquiry so far, the Committee considered that in cases of extreme drought arrangements for assistance between the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments must be consistent, transparent and clearly enunciated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's report comments on several other matters including rural counsellors, farm financial management, administration and implementation of the rural adjustment scheme, and access to Social Security benefits. I must say in regard to the Social Security benefits touted sincerely, I am sure, by the Minister as being of benefit to people in the community, that that hope has not been realised. It has been very difficult for some people to get assistance through the Social Security scheme and structure. We should reconsider in some instances making this assistance available to enable people to continue to live until the rains come. In many instances, that assistance was given as the Committee visited the drought areas. We were thanked for that by the locals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not address all of the other matters specifically as I am sure other members of the Committee will comment on the issues when they speak to the report. Finally, the Committee's report notes that some of the recommendations of the Drought Policy Review Task Force have been implemented but responses to most of the recommendations are yet to be made. Accordingly, the Committee considers that it is imperative that the package of recommendations contained in the report of the D<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>rought Policy Review Task Force be reviewed immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recognises that it is important for Australia, as one of the driest continents on the globe, to develop a comprehensive, integrated and effective approach to drought. The Committee therefore recommends that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, in consultation with other members of the Australian Agricultural Council, give urgent attention to the development and implementation of a clearly defined and comprehensive approach for the management of drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that this is our first report. As I indicated and emphasised earlier, we wanted to make the report available to the Australian Agricultural Council. We wished to add the force of our argument and thoughts to those that had been expressed in the report of the previous task force and to the attitude of people in the community. We will be bringing down a final report. It is the intention of the Committee, by working in a cooperative way, to do that within two months. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to support the remarks of the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, Senator Burns. Everyone knows the history of this Committee, which has only just been set up. It is the first standing committee on rural and regional affairs in the Federal Parliament since 1942 or 1944. I believe it is an indictment of this Parliament that since that time we have not had an all party standing committee to look after rural and regional interests. We can now look in a bipartisan way at different subjects that are put to us by way of terms of reference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 67 submissions were received on drought. We looked at a national drought policy and the appropriate Government responses to the recommendations of the Drought Policy Review Task Force. I believe that it is a great achievement that the interim report has been brought down in such a short time. It has been tabled well within the time frame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Chairman chaired the Committee well. I believe that the members of the Committee have worked well together. I think special thanks should go to Neil Bessell and the members of his staff on the Rural and Regional Affairs Committee for the job that they have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 166 witnesses appeared before the Committee in under four weeks. So we had a great number of people to listen to. In some places people told us of the devastation caused by the drought in their area. Of course, this drought followed a period of high interest rates which had prevailed in the community for so long. It also followed a downturn in commodity prices. There has also been a very deep recession in place in rural communities. Obviously, those factors caused a lot more problems in terms of this drought than had been the case with previous droughts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this Committee to go out to the people, whether they be in New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania, Western Australia or South Australia, and talk to them where it is really happening was, I think, most important. First of all, we were impressed with the strength of the people out in the communities. I think you actually have to go out into the rural communities to see the depth of the problems that are associated with the rural communities at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland one in every seven grain properties is for sale and farm debt has increased by 24 per cent since 1989-91. We were told that as a result of the drought lost production in Queensland was just under $1 billion and that in the coming year there would be another loss to Queensland of some $1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the area that really struck the Committee most was the western division of New South Wales. That is where people broke down at the table while giving evidence. It was the most moving experience that I have had since I have been in the Federal Parliament. People gave evidence of losing 10,000 out of 15,000 sheep. Other people had lost 2,000 out of 4,000 of their breeding ewes. The problem is how those people will get going again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard evidence that everyone wants to be self-reliant. I can understand that. The farmer never wants a handout. He does not want to be pandered to. He just wants a fair go. It was brought home to me at the Committee hearings that the farming communities were just not getting a fair go at the moment. They used to have an income equalisation deposit scheme that was very popular prior to 1983. Now that that scheme has been changed, it is not anywhere near as popular. People do not want to put money into it because of the very nature of the scheme. It does not give the incentive to people to prepare for drought. We believe that everyone wants to be self-reliant and that people in the farming community should be self-reliant to prepare themselves for drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem that concerns the Committee, and me in particular, is how people are going to put money into income equalisation deposits when they do not have big cash flows at the moment. All the big cash flows from the mid-1980s have now been lost so there has to be some method of allowing people to become self-reliant. Self-reliance, and the fact that income equalisation deposits should definitely be revamped, is one area to which the Committee addressed itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Different people suggested different ways in which the income equalisation deposits could be revamped. The most persuasive way was that the farmer should get a deduction from his income in the year of placing his money into the income equalisation deposits. Also, the farmer should get a reasonable rate of income from interest rates when he has the money in the income equalisation deposits. When he withdraws the money in the year of drought, he should be able to pay tax at the rate that is applicable in that particular year. The rural counsellor, Mrs Katherine Simms from the Macquarie Rural Advisory Service, made the point in our report and it is clearly enunciated here. I quote from the report where she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general&mdash;and this includes right down to the hardest battler and one who is leaving his property&mdash;I have not found a farmer who would say that the philosophy of self-reliance is wrong. I think farmers are basically looking to be self-reliant. They are not looking for any handouts. However, in reality, in Australia's climate, drought hits hard and without some form of assistance of whatever kind, farmers feel they are not going to be able to make it through.</PARA>
<PARA>There was another area that the Committee felt needed attention. We were of the view that effective depreciation or other tax measures were needed to provide incentive for farmers and graziers to become self-reliant. I know that Senator Crane will talk on this. Throughout the inquiry he has been talking and asking questions about tax credits and whether that would be a way to solve the problem. It is good to see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator McMullan, in the chamber tonight because he may be able to take on board some of those ideas about tax credits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area considered was the fact that the Commonwealth always has to play a part. Although the Government has taken drought out of the natural disaster relief arrangements, it still has to recognise that when a drought gets beyond the capabilities of the individual and the State to handle it in an economic way, it then becomes necessary for the Commonwealth to do something. That requires more than rural assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the areas that has concerned me since we brought in this report&mdash;and we brought it in quickly for the Agricultural Council meeting&mdash;is that the Council has said that it wants to take away the transaction-based support. They also want to phase out subsidies for stock to be taken away from properties and stock to be brought back to properties after drought. In New South Wales, for example, the State Government has spent more than $9.2m on helping farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some 16,666 applications from rural communities for assistance in the transport of water and feed to stock or to move stock in and out of drought-affected areas. That area is very important because environmentally it is good. The stock gets away from the property in the drought. It is good for the animals and it is good from the animal welfare aspect. It is good for retaining the breeding herd and the breeding flock and that is absolutely essential. So it concerns me that the Agricultural Council and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, do not think a little bit more about those transaction-based subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment we have not got a national drought policy. That is what concerns the Committee and that is what we went to look at&mdash;the Drought Policy Review Task Force's recommendations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think people would prefer too much rather than not enough, from what we were able to see. The other thing that we were able to see in visiting such a broad range of places was the contrasting agricultural systems that exist in this country. This means that drought in different places has different effects and different factors also affecting it. These inspections provided us with first hand knowledge of this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have never before seen soil actually moving. In areas that Senator Crane is familiar with we were shown the effects of this and why it is so essential to move stock out of such areas very quickly. Soil will move because it is so fragile. Yet in other areas stock can be left on the whole time. Sure, there is dust, but the soil does not have the same reaction to the cloven hoofed animals. It is very important for us as senators to recognise and outline in our reports that there is a very wide difference within the country in the effects upon drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also other factors that affect drought. It is not just lack of rain that has an impact. It is things like the build up of native animals. We have provided watering holes or water supplies for native animals around this country and we now have a much larger number of kangaroos than when the white colony first arrived in 1788. We also had evidence that people would sow a crop of barley, oats or wheat and it would be the only couple of hundred acres of green fodder within miles. They were not able to get a crop off it, but had to put their stock on it very quickly because they were competing with the animals, and if they had not put their stock on they would have lost the value of the crop, even though it was only fodder and not grains as they would have hoped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were also able to look at the problems of feral animals. One women in Cobar gave evidence that in the three months from January 1991 to April 1991 she employed someone to eradicate rabbits. She had 19,000 pairs of rabbits destroyed on her property in three months. The impact of this, coupled with a shortage of water and feed, has a devastating effect not just on the land but also on the animals that the farmers are trying to graze to make sure that they get to a decent marketable standard. We also learnt of the problems that woody weeds add to drought and the problems of distance, which is well known to many people here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had evidence of the important role of women in farming pursuits. As we know, one-third of farmers are women. We also had evidence from some witnesses that some organisations and some banks&mdash;not all&mdash;do not fully appreciate the role that these women play. That is a problem for those organisations. It is also a problem for those farming families and farmers who have to deal with these organisations. That is something that no number of reports on drought will overcome. It is something that we as senators must be aware of when we are talking to these organisations; we must remind them to be conscious that one-third of farmers are women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We spoke with a number of excellent rural counsellors. The service and support that they are providing to these primary producers in hard times when they not only have a commodity price drop but also a drought superimposed on that, is valuable. We recognised that they also require access to a wide range of appropriate support services. This is not just support services in terms of their financial counselling but it is also the support services in terms of general counselling and general support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must never lose sight of the fact that anybody who is working in the area of counselling and providing those types of support must themselves have some sorts of support mechanisms otherwise we will end up with counsellor burn-out. This is an area that can be pursued further with the authorities. We spoke to a number of these counsellors and they were able to get this support counselling that professional counsellors and the like use, but they had to organise it themselves; there was nothing within the structures of the whole thing to ensure that they were provided with these support mechanisms. That is something that I feel very concerned about and I think we must continue to pay attention to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also heard the counsellors say that it was often difficult to refer people who came to them to other counsellors for other types of problems that they may have had. It is very easy to be presented with a physical problem such as a financial problem because that can be looked at as something that is tangible and there to be changed and moved. We also have to make sure that people recognise the need to support these counsellors to broaden their role of counselling knowledge and experience.

I refer to those sections of the Income Tax Assessment Act colloquially known as the terrible twins, or sections 160M(6) and 160M(7). These two sections of the Income Tax Assessment Act have been brought to the attention of every tax writer and commentator in the land by the recent High Court decision in the Hepples case. Before I fully explain that case, I will give some examples of the adverse comments that have arisen:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A capital gains tax fiasco.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision of the Full High Court in the Hepples Case must. . . be a nightmare come true for the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hepples case. . . represents the Finnegan's Wake of the Australian Capital Gains Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The High Court decision (in the Hepples case) was a disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The law is obscure to the point of being impenetrable.</PARA>
<PARA>Last October during the Senate Estimates hearings, I raised this case with the Government and the officers of the Australian Taxation Office. I emphasised the need for an urgent clarification of this part of the capital gains legislation. Senator McMullan, who is in the chamber tonight, in answer to questioning at that time agreed and an assurance was given that the Government would examine the issue and that, hopefully, before the end of the last sitting something would be done. Nothing was forthcoming last session, and I now take this opportunity to remind the Government of its assurances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The beginning of a new session is now upon us. The uncertainty, the confusion and now the possible window of opportunity that has been opened for executives to receive tax-free payments needs to be clarified once and for all by legislation. The High Court has only recently ruled on this case. It decided to allow commonsense to prevail and to uphold the previous judgment. The amount received by Hepples is to be tax free. However, in the previous judgment by the High Court on this case, strong words were used that indicated that it was up to the Parliament to act to clarify these confusing sections of the Act. I now call upon the Government to confirm its previous assurances and to act in a responsible manner to clear the confusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts of the case are relatively simple. In 1986 William Hepples was the general manager of the Hunter Douglas window furnishings division. He was paid $40,000 by his employer for giving a covenant not to compete after his employment ended and not to divulge trade secrets&mdash;a not uncommon agreement. The Commissioner of Taxation, wishing to exact his pound of flesh, included this amount in the assessable income of Mr Hepples, relying on the two difficult capital gains provisions I have already mentioned. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Five years later, and probably well over $100,000 or more in legal fees, the courts have decided in favour of Mr Hepples. However, since 1986, when the capital gains tax legislation was enacted, there has been a chorus of commentators debating the meaning of these terrible twins, sections 160M(6) and 160M(7). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court justices in this instance are no different. The decisions reached have added only further layers of complexity to the tax law. Let me give an analysis of their decisions. In the Hepples case, four judges found section 160M(6) inapplicable. A differently constituted four judges said that section 160M(7) did not apply. A further majority of four judges, differently constituted this time, found that either provision applied. Where they did agree, different judges often had different reasons for reaching the same conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The justices have failed by their judicial technique to deliver some certainty and clarity to the law on the question of public importance. This illustrates that this section of the tax laws is in an appalling state. Even the highest courts of the land are divided on the meaning of vital sections, and even when they do agree on the application they do so for different reasons. Consequently, because the judges could not agree, we have a situation where, as one commentator put it, four out of seven judges found for the Commissioner. Including the Federal Court, this means that six out of 10 judges found for the Commissioner, yet at the end of the day the taxpayer won the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent ruling of the High Court in the past fortnight reaffirms this situation. One of the judges, Sir William Deane, has aptly displayed what is wrong with the terrible twins sections of the Income Tax Assessment Act. He stated in his comments on this case:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Statutes imposing taxation derogate from the ordinary rights of the citizen in that they represent a compulsory exaction of money. . . The framing of such legislation is essentially within the control of government. Indeed, in so far as the provisions of the Act are concerned, it would seem that, particularly in relation to technical matters, the content and drafting of such provisions may, on occasions, reflect the advice and views of officers of the ATO. . . In circumstances where the heavy burden of legal costs is likely to constitute an insurmountable obstacle to the challenge by the average taxpayer of an assessment in the courts and where successive administrations have allowed the Act to become a legislative jungle. . . the least that such a taxpayer is entitled to demand of government, is that, once the relevant provisions are finally identified, a legislative intent to impose a tax upon him or her in respect of a commonplace transaction will be expressed in clear words.</PARA>
<PARA>In simple, plain words, the taxpayer should be able to understand clearly whether or not he needs to pay tax. It is the Government's responsibility in framing the legislation to see that the taxpayer understands. The capital gains terrible twins need to be simplified as well as clarified. This is not the first time the courts have been critical of the capital gains section of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important point that must not be forgotten is that, under a system of self-assessment, the Government expects members of the community to understand what the law requires them to pay in tax. To help in this understanding, there are heavy penalties for understatement of tax. Margaret Gibson in her syndicated column states that one of the reasons for the degeneration of our taxation laws to a `legislative jungle' is that Parliament, especially during recent years, has seemed to be merely a rubber stamp for the Taxation Office. She states that if our seven justices of the High Court cannot satisfactorily interpret a tax provision, it is not likely that our politicians in Canberra have understood the full effect of what has been passed. I honestly believe that in this case that is what has happened. It has been beyond everybody's comprehension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go back to the explanatory memorandum, it is not surprising that we were all fooled. The explanatory memorandum which accompanied the Income Tax Assessment Amendment (Capital Gains) Bill and the Income Tax (Rates) Amendment Bill in 1986 stated when referring to subsection 160M(6):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sub-section 160M(6) applies to a disposal of an asset that did not exist (either by itself or as part of another asset) before the disposal, but is created by the disposal. The sub-section makes clear&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>note that it says `clear'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that such circumstances constitute a disposal of the asset for the purposes of this Part.</PARA>
<PARA>When the words of the explanatory memorandum are expressed in such terms that make it clear&mdash;when, heaven forbid, the seven justices found it difficult to make it clear&mdash;it is not surprising that people of our ilk were misled. It was this Government which passed the sections&mdash;indeed it was this Parliament&mdash;thinking, as the explanatory memorandum had stated, that it clearly refers to what is an asset and the circumstances of what is constituted a capital gain. It is now this Government's responsibility to clarify these sections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government cannot continue to allow ordinary Australian taxpayers to enter into ordinary business transactions uncertain of their tax fate. Tax lawyers and advisers can provide some assurances, but there is no clear answer. A further manifestation of the complexity of the tax laws is the position that so many of Australia's largest companies have found themselves in, according to the Pappas Carter report, in coming to a conclusion somewhat different to tax auditors. I refer again to the Hepples case. In fact, as one eminent tax lawyer has stated to me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Speaking as a person who has had to spend hours dissecting the decision to determine what it decides, if anything, I find it an intolerable waste of taxpayers' money. This is now exaggerated by the fact that I and other members of the tax advising community will now have to pass the cost of analysing the decisions on to our clients.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an intolerable situation. The tax expert continues&mdash;I reiterate the sentiment of his remarks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from the paucity in the drafting of the legislation, what this case illustrates is the need for specific legal divisions within the judicial hierarchy. At the very least there should be a tax division within the Federal and High Courts so that we can get some consistency into tax decisions.</PARA>
<PARA>I support that. Consistency is important. In order to achieve this we have to have a separate tax division within the Federal Court and the High Court. In conclusion, let me say that as far as the terrible twins are concerned it is now Parliament's turn and it must act decisively in the wider public interest. I look forward to Senator Evans's response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that the electorate of Hotham, in which my office is located, is at the coalface of what is the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Unemployment in Hotham has almost tripled in the last 18 months. In Oakleigh, the number of unemployed has quadrupled since the last Federal election. There are now over 40,000 people in the south-eastern suburbs who have been forced onto the dole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Nissan plant at Clayton, situated in the heart of Hotham, will close in October. Some 1,800 Nissan workers will lose their jobs. It has been estimated that up to 6,000 more jobs may go as a result of the effect of Nissan's closure on local suppliers and retailers. A large number of other locally based companies, including Humes, Bosch, R.P.Scherer and Telecom Industries, for a variety of reasons&mdash;some because of reform and some because of the failure of the Government to realise how its regulations have a stranglehold on some industries and are affecting them&mdash;are also being forced to retrench significant numbers of workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, the local member, Mr Crean, is running scared. In a desperate attempt to divert attention from the fact that it is his Government that deliberately caused this recession, Mr Crean has been announcing special packages and task forces to assist workers affected by the Nissan closure. But there has been precious little from Mr Crean for the thousands of other Hotham people who have lost their jobs or businesses as a direct result of this Government's failed policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The specific local example I want to refer to this evening is typical of this Government's attitude. It shows how politically motivated Mr Crean's recent actions have been and how a member of parliament can quite willingly sit on his hands when the media spotlight is cast somewhere else. Acromet is an Australian firm situated in Clayton in the heart of Mr Crean's electorate of Hotham. It was established in 1962 and manufactures and supplies pumps to local and overseas buyers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two weeks ago Acromet wrote to its local member, Mr Crean, expressing concern about various issues relating to the conduct of an Australian Construction Services tender for metering pumps for the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. Acromet is concerned about the validity of the tenderer's rationale for favouring a German competitor which has been rewarded a large slice of this contract. Acromet contends that it satisfied all of the requirements set down in the tender and by the inspecting engineers of ACS and CSL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Acromet claims that the reasons given for favouring the German company over it are fallacious and cast grave doubts on the capabilities and qualifications of the decision makers. Acromet believes that it is also able to offer far superior post-installation service, support facilities and expressed doubt as to whether its German competitor's product was subject to the same rigorous testing as its own metering pumps. Disturbingly, Acromet also claims that its competitor was able to resubmit its prices subsequent to the closure of the tender while the Australian firm's request for a similar opportunity was rejected by ACS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress that I am not in a position to make an informed decision about the comparative worth of each of the tender applicants or about the claims that Acromet makes. However, the concerns expressed by Acromet are indeed serious. The concerns expressed are doubly serious, I believe, when an Australian manufacturer is expressing them in relation to an overseas competitor for a Commonwealth Government contract. I think we would all agree that it is inappropriate for the Federal Government to favour local producers regardless of quality and price. I consider that, all things being equal, we have an obligation to support Australian companies. The Government's procurement guidelines also reflect this point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Acromet is claiming that all things are not equal in this particular case. It is adamant that it can provide both a superior product and superior post-installation service. It claims that it is the victim of the technical cringe mentality whereby preference is given to foreign brands due to a longstanding distrust of the quality of Australian products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been the reaction of the local member, Mr Crean? Nothing&mdash;not a reply, not an acknowledgment. I know that it has been only two weeks, but in the electorate of Hotham the loss of one&mdash;albeit not very large&mdash;contract means that one or two jobs are not available. I have had people in my office in tears because they do not have a job. Every little bit counts. Each of those small businesses is creating the one or two jobs that will add up to create employment in that area. There has been nothing from the honourable member. It is all very well to get publicity, to go out and make promises to the Nissan employees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And very quickly, as Senator Watson so rightly says. But when it is a small thing, a small company and a small contract that is in question there is no response from Mr Crean. Frustrated at Mr Crean's lack of action and after receiving no acknowledgment from him of Acromet's letter&mdash;I acknowledge that as a Minister he is busy and that this is a small factory in his electorate&mdash;it wrote to me informing me of its concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the company's approach, I visited its factory, inspected its pumps, talked to the engineers and these people who are so proud of their pumps and was given a list of a thousand firms. If I were to repeat the names of those firms here in this chamber, the names would be recognised&mdash;large firms, medical firms and firms which need pumps to pump products in such a way that germs, disease and bacteria cannot get in. This company is supplying pumps to leading companies in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of my visit and my discussions with Acromet, I have written only today to the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, asking him to postpone the letting of this contract in the light of its strongly expressed concerns. In my representations I have also asked Senator Bolkus for any available relevant information pertaining to the letting of this tender, including the rationale for the final decision, details of product testing and specialist advice sought and the relevant qualifications of the decision makers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Minister to give this matter his urgent attention. Australian manufacturers are finding it hard enough to survive with the excessive taxes and regulations imposed by Labor. To then ask them to overcome the technical cringe mentality of government decision makers is simply too much in the current recession. As I said before, each one or two jobs created by these businesses will help to get Australia back on track. I call on the Minister to address the issue I have raised this evening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will only take a few minutes of the Senate's time. Today, outside this Parliament House, there was a demonstration by a number of people who had travelled some distance to be at Parliament House, hear some speeches and present what they call `a log of claims' to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think everybody in this chamber has from time to time had presented to them what the presenters have called `a petition', and very often these things are not in a form which is suitable for presentation to the chamber. One of the people from this group outside came in to see me this afternoon and said, `We wanted to present this to the Prime Minister but were incapable of doing so. Can you present it to the Senate?'. It is not in a form which can be presented to the Senate; the signatures were not even attached to the letter. But it does seem to me that in a democracy it is not sufficient for those of us who know the correct form of these things to deny the citizenry the opportunity to present words to the Parliament which are their words and which are in the form of a claim on the Parliament to consider certain things. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I refer the honourable senator to the answer to Question No. 1361 published in Hansard on 26 November 1991. The Department of Defence's assessment is that the figure is closer to 40 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) I presume that the honourable senator is referring to section 25(4) of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act. The answer to the question is in sub-section (b) of that section which, in relation to the conduct of an election for a health and safety representative for a designated work group, provides that, if there is more that one involved union in relation to the group, the unions agree on which union is to conduct the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Health and safety provisions for the Defence Force relate essentially to the performance by the ADF of its current and foreseeable military function. Hence the decision was made that ADF health and safety must continue to be within the chain of command and that ADF members will be excluded from sections 24 to 38 of the Act, insofar as the term 'employee' is applicable. As such, ADF members will not be members of Designated Work Groups and, as a consequence, they are ineligible to vote for, or be nominated as, Health and Safety representatives under the provisions of the Act. All other provisions of these sections will apply to members of the ADF, particularly those relating to the responsibilities of the Commonwealth as an employer, which will be exercised through the ADF chain of command.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The draft Defence Circular Memorandum of 12 August was a working paper in an early stage of development. The sentence quoted by the honourable senator was contained in that particular draft. It was at the time thought to reflect an interpretation of the equivalent provision in the Victorian OH&amp;S Act. Among the amendments made to subsequent drafts was the deletion of that sentence on the grounds of doubt about its accuracy.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Science and Technology has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's question: <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer to questions (a) (b) (c) and (d) is that, in the years 1985 to 1990, a number of CSIRO scientists attended conferences and meetings using funds provided directly or indirectly by the chemical industry or by individual companies. CSIRO's accounting systems are not designed to report comprehensively on the issues of travel and associated expenditure sponsored by companies. Accordingly, the question was referred to Institutes and Divisions for responses and the following information is based on these responses which are as encompassing as their accounting systems allow. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Virtually all CSIRO proposals for research to be funded by industry include a travel component for purposes such as consultation with scientific colleagues, negotiation with existing or potential commercial partners, or communication of the results to end-users. Travel expenses are also an integral part of charges made for any consultancy work CSIRO undertakes for industry. Most of the funds in question were provided as part of normal CSIRO industry collaboration, where industry funds contribute to relevant attendance at conferences and meetings. In some cases the funds are provided by industry and consumer associations, not by individual companies and are directed at conferences which discuss reductions in chemical use.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chiefs of CSIRO Divisions have responsibility for determining whether to accept external funds under the amount of $100,000; the question of any potential conflict of interest is one of a number of factors, including relevance of the project to CSIRO's charter, taken into account before any decision is made to accept such funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSIRO's relationships with industry, including those with "the chemical industry" provide Australian research and Australian industry with a means of working closely together for the benefit of both parties and ultimately for the benefit of all Australians. CSIRO would strongly oppose any attempt from industry to compromise its independence, and most certainly does not consider that its relationships with industry render it susceptible to any undue influence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the Division of Chemicals and Polymers, no officers of the Division have received direct payment from the chemical industry or individual chemical companies to attend conferences, meetings, study tours or other excursions. This Division carries out most of the research done by CSIRO to support the Australian chemical industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Division's strategy is to apply its research results and to utilise its expertise in chemistry to develop new products and processes for Australian manufacturing. An important feature of this strategy is to undertake research projects in collaboration with the chemical industry at as early a stage as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of collaborative research agreements have been established with individual chemical companies operating in Australia. These companies provide external funding to augment Appropriation funds to the extent of meeting a target of 30 per cent of total funding of the Division, which is a guideline set by the CSIRO Board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An action plan is drawn up for each research project and lists the financial contributions by CSIRO and the company, and how these funds will be spent by the Division on salaries, equipment and operating costs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The independence of CSIRO is assured through these arrangements, which are providing the industry with a basis for the development of new products and processes.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2b i,ii,iii) The matter of the adequacy of product information for these products had been raised at a meeting of the National Co-ordinating Committee for Therapeutic Goods in October 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This committee contains representatives of the Commonwealth, State and Territory Health Departments and the product information is relevant to the committee because of the public health information on the treatment of head lice issued by the States and Territories. The Committee identified deficiencies in some of the product information and the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) undertook a review of the product information to ensure its consistency with current attitudes for the treatment of head lice infestations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package inserts are currently under review by the TGA and a detailed answer for each product is not available. However, attached is a publication issued by the Queensland Department of Health (attachment 2&mdash;additional copies are available from the Senate Table Office) which was published following a careful review of the current knowledge on pediculosis and its treatment. The product information is being assessed for consistency against this document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important points are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)there is no place for the prophylactic use of these preparations unless the label text is worded in terms of protection against reinfestation during a confirmed outbreak,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)it is important to follow the recommended contact times and products should generally not be used more than once weekly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The frequency of treatment depends on the agent used. In the case of maldison (malathion), only one application is necessary because it destroys the eggs and the lice. Success depends upon the patient using the product exactly in accordance with instructions, typically being a 12 hour contact time. In some package inserts, reference is made to using a second application of malathion about one week after the first, which is to eradicate a new infestation, rather than clean up parasites that were not destroyed in the first application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pyrethrins, however, being non-ovacidal, must be applied in two applications seven days apart to destroy the emerging nymphs. The time interval is important as it coincides with the sensitive points of the parasite's life cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) if used as above, the potential toxicity of the active ingredients is acceptable.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) These are matters which are being covered in the review. As explained in the answer to (2), following the frequency of use is important to the efficacy of the products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sponsors will be asked to update product information to be consistent with the information in the Queensland publication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) As indicated in (3), prophylactic use of these preparations is not appropriate, except to prevent a reinfestation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Many of the products listed in (1) are locally manufactured and have been in the market for a substantial period. Until the start of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 on 15 February 1991, locally made therapeutic goods were not subject to premarket evaluation, except via the registration scheme which operated in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the start of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, a national scheme commenced which covers both locally made and imported products. Products being legally supplied at the commencement of the legislation had the right to apply for entry into the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods without assessment (grandfathering) at that stage. However, Section 31 of the Act permits the Secretary to require sponsors to provide further information about the goods upon request.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I did advise the Senate on 10 October that Mr Toohey was wrong when he asserted `that the Oberon standard displacement is 1600 tonnes compared with the 2500 tonnes for the Collins class'. I made this statement in view of the fact that 1600 tonnes equates quite closely with the publicly stated standard displacement of the Oberon, as listed in Janes Fighting Ships 1991/92, whereas 2500 tonnes equates quite closely with the estimate of the surface displacement of the Collins submarine as listed in the same publication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Mr Beazley did issue a media release on 18 May 1987 which quoted a displacement for the Oberon submarine of about 1600 tonnes. The reference quoted, Janes Fighting Ships 1986/87, states that 1610 tonnes is the standard displacement of the vessel. In my response to the Senate, I quoted a displacement of about 2030 tonnes for the Oberon, based on Janes data for the surface displacement. In fact modifications to the Oberons have resulted in small adjustments in both displacements. Displacements also vary slightly from vessel to vessel.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) is responsible for ensuring that adequate measures are in place to prevent the introduction of serious exotic pests and diseases into Australia. The present procedures for the importation of cut flowers recognise that potentially serious pests and diseases may be carried with these goods, and, consequently, appropriate inspection and treatment measures have been implemented to counter this risk. AQIS does not differentiate between those pests and diseases which can or cannot be controlled by chemicals currently available in Australia, but seeks to stop the entry of all quarantinable pests and diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) AQIS has developed strict procedures for the importation of plant material which is capable of transmitting serious pests and diseases. Imported cut flowers are subject to inspection for the presence of pests and diseases and, if detected, are treated accordingly. Where live insects are found, the consignment is fumigated with methyl bromide, whereas if diseases such as carnation anther smut and philophora wilt are detected, the consignment may be destroyed.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) AQIS' devitalisation requirements recognise that the risk of introducing exotic diseases is much greater in living plants than in non-propagatable plant material. By ensuring that all cut flower importations cannot be subsequently propagated by conventional methods, the risk of spreading exotic plant diseases is contained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The treatments which may be applied to cut flowers in exporting countries can vary considerably, and are not monitored by AQIS, as it is not a quarantine issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Commonwealth Government funding for non-government schools is provided according to assessed need with those schools with the greatest capacity to generate funds on their own behalf receiving the lowest level of Commonwealth subvention.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) It was never the intention of the Government to provide a minimum level of funding for non-government schools from both State and Commonwealth sources equivalent to 25 per cent of the Community Standard. This figure of 25 per cent has been drawn to the Minister's attention previously. It comes from Appendix D to Options for Commonwealth Funding of Recurrent Resources For Australian Schools&mdash;A Discussion Paper. This paper was circulated by the then Commonwealth Schools Commission in February 1984. Appendix D is simply a forecast resource configuration. The Hon Senator may be aware that in the body of the document mention is made of the difficulties some State Governments would have with the concept of a national resourcing standard. Further reference to differences in funding approaches across the States is found in the Commission's final document Funding Policies For Australian Schools although no mention is made of a 25 per cent minimum funding level.</PARA>

However, the Department tries to provide clients with a choice of suppliers/products on its contracts to enable purchasing officers to assess best value for money in their particular circumstances.

The program stresses an area focus and cooperation between all three levels of government is fundamental to achieving this.

The SAAP functional review report was considered by a meeting of Commonwealth, State and Territory Health and Welfare Ministers on 6 September.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Royal Australian Navy's Automated Manpower and Personnel System (RANAMPS) was planned to be Navy's unique automated personnel system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Royal Australian Survey Corps (RA Svy) does regularly produce digital and paper maps for the Australian Defence Force (ADF).

RA Svy provides 1:50 000 scale information to AUSLIG for their 1:100 000 and 1:250 000 scale map revision programs. RA Svy consults formally through the Inter-Governmental Advisory Committee on Surveying and Mapping and on a day to day basis with State mapping authorities with regard to the larger scale maps.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 2 December 1991 (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, page 3738) Senator Knowles asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>for Employment, Education and Training, the following question without notice:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Now that the Department of Employment, Education and Training in Western Australia has admitted that the returns from the training guarantee levy have been consumed in the cost of collecting it, can the Minister advise the Senate as to how this bungling mismanagement by the Department of Employment, Education and Training has occurred and what will be the shortfall?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has advised that it anticipates that some $5 million will be collected for the 1990-91 year in direct payments of shortfalls and funds realised as a result of audits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is less than anticipated and is indicative of employers' positive response to the legislation; in other words they are in general taking training seriously and are spending the required amount on training. This was a major object of the legislation and I am very pleased that it appears already, in the very early days of the Training Guarantee, to have been achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a possibility that the amounts collected into the Fund over the years 1990-91 to 1991-94 will not exceed essential Commonwealth administrative costs incurred by the Australian Taxation Office, the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the National Training Board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to the Senator's suggestions, this indicates the success of the Training Guarantee. The Commonwealth's administrative costs have been and continue to be essential in raising employer awareness of the Scheme and the need for increased investment in quality training. Employers have done their part by willingly responding to the new legislation as indicated by the low level of collections into the Fund thus far.</PARA>
