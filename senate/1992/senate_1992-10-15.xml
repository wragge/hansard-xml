<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 16 September 1992 I reported to the Senate on our concerns with these instruments. These concerns have now been met by helpful undertakings from the Minister for Land Transport, Mr Bob Brown, and the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, Mr Peter Staples. Because of the important and sensitive nature of the matters raised by the Postal Regulations, I will make a special statement when I withdraw the notice.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to 24 Hour Registered Nurse and Small Nursing Homes Additional Funding Principles 1992 made under paragraphs 48B(1)(a) and (b) of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Health Act 1953</EMPHASIS>, which were considered by the Committee at its meeting of 20 August 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has noted that significant discretions are conferred on the Secretary to make decisions as to the grant of benefits under principles 3, 5 and 6, and asks whether the exercise of such discretions is subject to review. The Committee also notes, in passing, that principle 5 refers to the Secretary as deciding whether something is appropriate "in his view". While the Committee accepts that the statement is correct at present, it suggests that gender-specific language might best be avoided in future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is particularly concerned to note that, while precise formulae are laid down in principles 4 and 7 for the calculation of Commonwealth benefit, the effect is vitiated by adding at the end of paragraphs 4(a) and (b) and 7(a) the phrase "or such other amount as the Minister may determine". The Committee asks whether such a provision is validly inserted under the provisions of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the time for giving notice of disallowance has almost expired, the Committee intends to give such notice to preserve its position while awaiting a response from you.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your major concern with these Principles appears to be the use of the term "or such other amount as the Minister may determine" in a number of places.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This phrase has been inserted to allow me to amend the amounts in line with increases in the award rates of the relevant staffing categories each quarter, and has been used only for this purpose. Given your concerns on this matter, however, I am prepared to undertake to take measures to amend the Principles to remove this phrase.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note your comments on the use of gender-specific language. I am once again prepared to undertake to take measures to amend the Principles to remove this.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted your undertakings to amend the Principles to meet two of its specific concerns. We are grateful for this prompt and courteous action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Committee would appreciate reasons why the discretions conferred on the Secretary are not subject to AAT review. We assume that this is because the discretions come within one of the areas recognised by the ARC as inappropriate for such review, but would welcome your advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would like to finalise its consideration of this matter at its meeting next week. Therefore, it would be appreciated if we could have a reply by Tuesday afternoon, 13 October 1992.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 8 October 1992 concerning the 24 Hour Registered Nurse and Small Nursing Homes Additional Funding Principles 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I addressed the issue of review provisions for the discretions in Principles 3 and 5 in my response to your letter of 14 September 1992. However, given your continuing concerns on this matter, I am prepared to undertake amendment of the Principles to either remove these discretions or to make them subject to AAT appeal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The position is more complex with the discretion under Principle 6.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two groups of homes receive the funding covered by Principle 6. The first group of homes, which I will refer to as "designated" homes, are those which are remote or which cater for ethnic groups whose needs could not be met in a general purpose nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second group are homes which are receiving this funding on a temporary basis, to assist them while they expand to achieve long term viability. This funding is being provided under a scheme which was announced in 1989 as being available only for a limited period. No further approvals are given under this scheme, and funding will cease on 31 December 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that funding will cease this calendar year for all homes covered under Principle 6, other than for the designated homes, it would not seem appropriate now to introduce AAT appeals in relation to these homes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the designated homes, I am prepared to undertake amendment of the Principles either to remove these discretions or to make them subject to AAT appeal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust that this information has satisfied the concerns of the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS (NOTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT) AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 establishes the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme. This Scheme provides a national system of notification and assessment of industrial chemicals which, among other things, aids in the protection of the Australian people and the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Scheme was introduced in 1990, the Government decided that the regulatory impact on industry would be reviewed after two years of operation. I am pleased to report that this review has now been completed. The recommendations arising from this review have led to the amendments proposed in the Bill which will remove impediments to product innovation within the chemical industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments are a further indication of the commitment of the Government to ensuring a workable and effective Scheme. It meets the objectives of protecting the Australian people and the environment, while reducing the regulatory burden on industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill allows for the introduction of three new notification categories: "eligible" chemicals, low volume chemicals, and synthetic polymers of low concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An amnesty period will be introduced for "eligible" chemicals to assist industry to comply with the Act. While companies have had the opportunity of nominating chemicals to the Australian Inventory of Chemical Substances from 1 January 1977 to 16 July 1990, some companies have neglected to nominate some chemicals. As the legislation currently stands, such companies would be in technical breach of the Act and liable to severe penalties. During the amnesty period such penalties will be waived, but as a safeguard, companies will be required to submit some basic information about each chemical. The Director will have the power to refuse the application if the chemical presents a significant hazard to human health or the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides that the period of the amnesty should be prescribed by regulation. The Government considers that a two year period for the amnesty, commencing on the date the Bill comes into effect, will be sufficient time for companies to come forward, especially when coupled with the planned intensive promotional campaign. However, if after two years there are still significant problems with compliance, then the arrangements will be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For low volume chemicals, that is chemicals which it is proposed be introduced in quantities of up to 100 kilograms per year, the notification and assessment requirements will be reduced. The 100 kilogram limit will be an Australia wide total and not a limit per applicant. Adequate safeguards will be in place to ensure the integrity of the Scheme is not compromised. A list of chemicals accepted under this category will be published at least on an annual basis in the Chemical Gazette.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Previously, companies were required to supply a full data package and a full application fee for these chemicals. Under these new arrangements both the data requirements and the application fee will be significantly reduced. The 100 kilogram threshold will be reviewed after two years. This review will also examine the possibility of a lower threshold where no assessment will be required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe these arrangements will be particularly beneficial to innovation in the chemical industry. This initiative is in line with overseas schemes which also have arrangements for low volume chemicals and demonstrates the Government's commitment to ensuring that our Scheme is in harmony with comparable schemes administered by our overseas trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Polymers of low concern are a class of chemicals which inherently pose little risk to human health or the environment. For polymers which meet prescribed criteria the Bill proposes that the notification and assessment requirements be streamlined. Companies will be required to supply the relevant information on a form and will not be required to submit raw data. For these chemicals, a copy of the Full Public Report will be published in the Chemical Gazette.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes being proposed in relation to this category, therefore, further demonstrate a commitment to streamline procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to make the decision making process for all the new categories introduced by these amendments as transparent and easily understood as possible, guidelines will be developed in consultation with government agencies, unions and industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Principal Act will also be amended to require that all assessment reports include a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS). The MSDS is an important vehicle for communicating safety and handling information to supervisors and workers. This amendment will ensure greater availability of the MSDS in the workplace and will assist the States and Territories in the operation of their occupational health and safety legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill includes a new provision which will enable the Commonwealth Government to make regulations to prohibit or restrict the introduction and export of chemicals that are the subject of prescribed international agreements. Such power is fundamental to meeting international obligations with respect to certain chemicals and follows significant advances internationally, especially within the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation and the United Nations Environment Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Prior informed consent" is one international scheme to which the provisions of the amendment could be applied. This scheme is based upon the principle that the export of a chemical which is banned, severely restricted or withdrawn from use in order to protect human health or the environment, should not proceed without the consent of the importing country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I intend, in circumstances where a chemical is to be banned or severely restricted, that thorough consultations occur with relevant government agencies and industry prior to a regulation being made. Administrative arrangements for international coordination on these chemicals will be developed in collaboration with relevant authorities. The Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency is the Designated National Authority for "prior informed consent" and will consult at an international level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Bill also contains some minor amendments of the Principal Act to simplify and remove redundant sections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The passage of the Bill will show the strength of the Government's commitment to reducing the regulatory burden on industry, while maintaining adequate safeguards for the Australian community and the environment. The Government is determined to create a regulatory climate which will foster industry development and thereby assist in achieving the Government's microeconomic reform objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also ensure that assessment effort is consistent with the level of risk posed by chemicals, and will result in the redirection of assessment effort to more needed areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Worksafe Australia has been instrumental in assessing the needs of the chemical industry and formulating these changes after extensive rounds of consultation with all the stakeholders. It has consulted with relevant Commonwealth, State and Territory agencies. Industry bodies consulted were the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Chemical Confederation of Australia, the Australian Chemical Industry Council and their affiliates. Discussion with other industry bodies not affiliated with these peak organisations have also taken place. In addition, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and interested non-government organisations were included in the consultation process. There is therefore widespread support for these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill makes minor changes to legislation concerning the federal industrial relations system, occupational health and safety, Commonwealth employment and the membership of the Remuneration Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industrial Relations Act 1988</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill contains two amendments of the Industrial Relations Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first amendment is to improve the operation of section 202 of the Act, to strengthen the administration of federally registered unions. Section 202, which has been in effect since 1989, is designed to overcome difficulties that can occur when a federal union and a State union have substantially overlapping membership. The section allows a federal union to enter into an agreement with a counterpart State union. When such an agreement is in place, members of the State union who are not within the federal union's eligibility rules can become members of the federal union and participate in its internal affairs. The federal union cannot represent the industrial interests of these members unless it successfully goes through the normal process, required by other provisions of the Act, to make the changes to its eligibility rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 202 provides a way of overcoming legal difficulties that might arise from the participation by the State union members in the affairs of the federal union.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing section 202 is confined to States which have legislation that confers corporate status on registered unions. Experience has shown that the section could usefully be extended to unions in the other two States&mdash;Victoria and Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new section 202 provides for this, and will also permit an agreement to be used to facilitate amalgamations between federally registered unions. In some circumstances, the amalgamation process could be assisted by the existence of an agreement under the section to secure the relationship between a federally registered union participating in the amalgamation and its State counterpart. The members of the latter can thereby be involved in approving the amalgamation. To avoid abuses, the new provision gives the Australian Industrial Relations Commission greater powers of supervision over agreements made under the section.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new section 202 remains a provision concerned with the rights of members to participate in the internal affairs of a federally registered union. It does not give such a union any additional rights to represent those members industrially. For these purposes, a federally registered union is limited by its eligibility rules, which will not be affected by an agreement under section 202.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second amendment gives the Australian Industrial Relations Commission the protection of the law of contempt of court. It will be an offence to do anything that would amount to contempt of court if the Commission were itself a court. Commonwealth law already gives this same protection to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Trade Practices Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This new provision will replace a broader provision in a paragraph of section 299 which the High Court has recently found to be invalid. The High Court interpreted that provision as purporting to prohibit criticism of the Commission even when that criticism was honest and fair. The new provision will not suffer from that defect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under this new provision, the genuine exercise of a right of criticism will not be an offence. The new provision will apply only if a person is acting in malice or attempting to impair the administration of justice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I intend that section 299 be further examined to see whether the entire provision should be revised. This will be done in consultation with employer and union representatives through the National Labour Consultative Council. It is appropriate, however, for the Commissions's protection against contempt to be provided for in the meantime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Long Service Leave and Maternity Leave</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will amend the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act and the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act. Both Acts will confer on the Secretary to the Department of Industrial Relations powers now conferred on the Public Service Commissioner. This is in line with existing administrative arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National Occupational Health and Safety Commission Act 1985</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will simplify the procedure for publishing standards, and codes of practice, made by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Public Service Act 1922</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments of the Public Service Act relate primarily to the Senior Executive Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, an amendment has been included to introduce more flexibility in transfers between specialist SES offices and SES offices that are not specialist offices. Under the current provisions, making a transfer at level between a specialist and other SES office involves a full merit selection process. The Act is being amended to introduce more flexibility where an SES specialist officer, who has previously occupied an office that is not a specialist office at equivalent or higher classification, and who has spent not more than 3 years performing the duties of a specialist office, is to be transferred from a specialist position to another SES office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the Act is being amended so that the provision relating to applications to decline transfer no longer applies to SES officers. The amendment reflects the changes to the SES transfer provisions made to the Act last year and the fact that the Act already requires the views of the officer in relation to the proposed transfer to be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, an amendment is made to section 76L of the Act relating to redeployment or retirement of SES officers so that two time periods of 14 days are specified within which an officer may provide views under the procedures put in place under the section.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another amendment of the Public Service Act relates to the powers of delegation of the Public Service Commissioner. To provide for more efficient administration the Act is being amended to ensure that existing delegations to persons with the powers of departmental secretaries will also be available to the heads of newly-created statutory authorities with the same powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Remuneration Tribunal Act</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill proposes an amendment of the Remuneration Tribunal Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, a person who has held a Commonwealth public office is precluded from appointment to the Remuneration Tribunal for a period of twelve months after they leave that appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will remove this twelve month disqualification period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act will continue to preclude the appointment to the Tribunal of any person who still holds a Commonwealth public office. Members of the Tribunal will continue to be required to disclose any conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment will ensure that the widest possible range of candidates is available for appointment to the Tribunal, and overcome difficulties in finding persons who have the necessary skills and experience for appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to other bills in the Industrial Relations portfolio</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also makes purely formal amendments to several Acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial impact</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this Bill is to put arrangements in place for the provision of general purpose assistance to the States and the Northern Territory in 1992-93, consistent with the decisions taken at the Premiers' Conference and Loan Council meeting on 12 June 1992. The Bill will replace the State Grants (General Purposes) Act 1991 and its provisions closely follow those of that Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current estimate of general purpose funding for the States and the Northern Territory under the Bill amounts to $14,092m or about 13 per cent of estimated Commonwealth Budget outlays in 1992-93. As such, these payments constitute a major element of the Commonwealth's Budget. In combination with the global borrowing limits agreed at the Loan Council meeting, they also have a major bearing on the spending and borrowing of State Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to requests from the States for greater certainty in funding levels for the purposes of planning their medium term budget strategies, the Commonwealth agreed at the 1990 Premiers' Conference and Loan Council meeting to maintain the level of general revenue assistance in real terms for the three years 1991-92 to 1993-94. This commitment was subject to the qualification that Australia did not experience a major deterioration in its economic circumstances. The Commonwealth honoured that undertaking at the 1991 Premiers' Conference and Loan Council meeting in respect of 1991-92, notwithstanding the sharp slowdown in economic activity and the consequent deterioration in its own budgetary position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the Heads of Government meeting on 11 May 1992 the Prime Minister, Premiers and Chief Ministers outlined the medium term budgetary prospects facing their governments. In essence, the States indicated that they faced a period of budgetary difficulties, while the Commonwealth referred to its own constrained budgetary position and the need to ensure that the total public sector's call on resources remained sustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Against this background, a working party of Treasury officers from the Commonwealth and the States was established to report on the medium term budgetary  outlook for both the Commonwealth and the States. That report is to be available to assist in a consideration of possible longer term Commonwealth/State financial arrangements at the 1993 Premiers' Conference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Discussions at the 1992 Premiers' Conference focused on financial arrangements for 1992-93 only. The Commonwealth reaffirmed the undertaking it made in 1990 to maintain the level of general revenue assistance in real terms for the three years 1991-92 to 1993-94. The Commonwealth also agreed to provide additional assistance on a one-off basis for 1992-93. The Commonwealth's initial offer was for $150m. However, it was decided that States would receive the higher of their share based on either the use of the Grants Commission's amended per capita relativities or on an equal per capita distribution. This raised the overall cost of the Commonwealth's offer to around $166m. This supplementary payment will not be reflected in the base level of funding for 1993-94 and beyond.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the assistance to be provided under this Bill is in the form of general revenue grants, which are currently estimated to be $13,795m in 1992-93. By far the larger part of this amount comprises financial assistance grants, but it also includes special revenue assistance&mdash;to the Northern Territory and Victoria&mdash;and continues the separate payment of `identified road funding' which was introduced for the first time in 1991-92 following the October 1990 special Premiers' Conference decision to untie local road funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with arrangements in previous years, financial assistance grants, special revenue assistance and identified road funding will all be adjusted for the difference between the actual increase in the Consumer Price Index in the year to the March quarter 1993 and the forecast at the time of the Premiers' Conference, so that the real level of assistance agreed at the Premiers' Conference is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the absence of agreement between the States and Territories on the appropriate basis for distributing financial assistance grants, the States accepted the Commonwealth's compromise proposal whereby the base level of financial assistance grants will be distributed on the basis of the Grants Commission's updated per capita relativities. These relativities are in accordance with the terms of reference provided to the Commission in November 1991, and amended in line with supplementary calculations provided by the Commission in April 1992. As in recent years, the relativities are applied to a combined pool of financial assistance grants and the base level of hospital funding grants. In respect of the additional $150m, as mentioned previously, the States and Northern Territory will receive the higher of their share based on either the use of the Commission's 1992-93 relativities or an equal per capita distribution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As noted earlier, the Northern Territory is to be provided with special revenue assistance in 1992-93. Similar special assistance has been provided each year to the Northern Territory since its inclusion in the pool of general revenue assistance for the States. While it is still the Commonwealth's intention to move the Northern Territory progressively to a financial basis comparable with the States, the base level of its special revenue assistance for 1992-93 has been held at $40m, the same level as in 1991-92.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision is also made this year for the payment of special revenue assistance of $139m to Victoria to compensate it for the loss of petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT) revenue following the Commonwealth's decision earlier this year not to share that revenue. This payment is made on the understanding that it will be absorbed into the financial assistance grants base for 1993-94. This gives effect to the Commonwealth's undertaking that the decision not to share PRRT revenue would not affect the total level of funding available to the States, while removing any link between the level of payments to the States and the Commonwealth's PRRT revenue. It will also ensure that the other States and Territories are unaffected financially by this decision in 1992-93.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also provides for the payment of $296.8m for capital grants to the States and the Northern Territory. This is the same amount as provided in 1991-92.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No provision is made in this Bill for payments of general purpose assistance to the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). However, provisions in Appropriation Bill No. 2 allow for analogous payments to be made to the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this Bill is an integral part of the Commonwealth's financial relations with the State Governments and the Budget. I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the related Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before we proceed with each of the amendments in due order, I think it is important also to consider the report of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs which was tabled in this Parliament yesterday. I intend to address the comments of that particular report only in a very broad manner before we then deal specifically with the various amendments that both the coalition and the Australian Democrats foreshadowed during the Standing Committee hearings and intend to proceed with in the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to look at the process by which this Bill has been brought before the Parliament. I remind the Committee that this issue has been current since the middle of 1991. As a result of the deliberations of the Senate Standing Committee, Mr Duggan from the Human Rights Branch of the Attorney-General's Department wrote to the Committee and outlined a process of consultation that the Government has undertaken on this very important legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Mr Duggan's letter, which is attached as an appendix to the Standing Committee report, it is interesting to note that the so-called consultation process essentially was very one sided. Certainly, the Government has prepared a number of discussion papers at various stages since the middle of 1991, and consultations were undertaken with the various peak employer, union and business bodies as a result of those early papers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consultation is also a two-way process. It is a matter of taking account of the views and opinions that are expressed by various groups and various organisations. I am certainly well aware that during 1991, as part of the Government's process after distributing the papers, comments were made to various departments and committees to take up those points. But none of the issues raised by a number of the concerned groups subsequently resulted in any amendments to the legislation. I believe the Government had a fixed agenda in relation to the legislation, a predetermined position, to which it has held to this day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Friday, at the Senate Standing Committee hearings, a number of concerned groups presented additional information. As part of the discussion on the amendments, I will certainly be drawing on some of the evidence that was presented to the Standing Committee last Friday. The Government has used its numbers on the Committee last Friday and not agreed to any of the proposals or suggestions put forward by groups, by the Democrats, or flagged by the coalition for any further or subsequent amendments. Therefore, we will be required to consider them in the Committee of the Whole again this morning. So the process goes on whilst the Government says it would look at the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Committee that in the second reading speech by the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) earlier this year in the House of Representatives, he invited submissions on the legislation after he had in fact tabled the second reading speech. In the Standing Committee on Friday, we ascertained that some 50 submissions were subsequently made to the Minister, his Department, the Attorney-General's Department or the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Not one of those submissions resulted in subsequent amendment even though the Minister himself invited submissions back in March. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have seen a very fixed agenda by the Government. The Government has stuck to its own rigid rules on what it has intended to do since the middle of 1991 with regard to this legislation. I would argue that, to a large degree, that makes a mockery of the so-called consultation process. The distributing of bits of paper by the Government to 1,200 groups or whatever is very much a one-sided view if the resulting views and opinions that are expressed, particularly from serious consideration by particular groups, result in no movement whatsoever by the Government on important points or principles that have been addressed. It is a pity that the Government has seen no room to accommodate any of the views that have been expressed by particular groups on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of my colleagues would probably also want to address general views. So, before we proceed to the first amendment that I have distributed, I will give them the opportunity to add general comments. I will then be happy to go through each of the amendments that we have circulated. </PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"(c) the presence in the body of a notifiable infectious disease, including HIV and AIDS".</PARA>
<PARA>The first amendment circulated in my name relates to clause 4 and deals with the definition of `disability'. The amendment seeks to delete from the definition of `disability' paragraphs (c) and (d) which read:</PARA>

<PARA>Our amendment addresses the concern that was expressed, particularly, by the Australian Medical Association that the existing definition is scientifically untenable. Dr Flecknoe-Brown told the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs last week that&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the wording as it exists now is quite meaningless because we all carry organisms that, in the right circumstances, are capable of causing disease.

<PARA>As I mentioned in my speech during the second reading debate on this Bill, this definition, which is fundamental to the entire operation of the proposals of the Bill, goes to the core of discrimination against people with disabilities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of the definition of `disability' is, admittedly, a difficult one. It is one where it is incumbent upon the Government to take into account advice from medical authorities, but one also has to keep in mind the social purpose of the Disability Discrimination Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important at the outset to remind the Committee that the operation of the Bill depends not only on demonstration of the existence of a disability, however it is defined, but also, in order to have a grievance or a complaint successfully recognised or acknowledged by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, if it comes to that process, one has to have the disability demonstrated as a cause for discrimination. It is always important to keep in mind that nothing flows from simply having a disability. What one has to demonstrate is that the disability was the trigger for discriminatory conduct on the part of other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, looking at the definition offered in the Opposition amendment, once again I think the social purpose of the legislation has to be kept in mind; that is, as a civilised community, we need to have a nationwide approach to the question of disability discrimination so that Australians, in whatever State or Territory jurisdiction they find themselves, are confident that they will enjoy the same rights as other Australians who have the same disability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's amendment would mean that we would lose uniform national coverage. Notifiable diseases, as the honourable senator would know, are defined under State legislation. Despite recommendations by the National Health and Medical Research Council for uniformity, these vary from State to State. For example, hepatitis C is not notifiable in the Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia; haemophilias influenza type B is not notifiable in the Northern Territory and Western Australia; and rabies is not notifiable in New South Wales. So I think that is an important consideration for honourable senators in this Committee when deciding whether to adopt this particular amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to say that it is quite clearly possible for a person to harbour the organism of an infectious disease and yet not exhibit the disease. I am advised that this commonly occurs with tuberculosis. It is quite clear that a person might be discriminated against as a carrier of infection or as a harbourer&mdash;if that is the word&mdash;of organisms, but these people may not be able to claim redress because they do not exhibit the disease. This Opposition amendment is couched in terms of the presence of an infectious disease, not merely in terms of the presence of the organism which might be a precursor to, or, obviously, a necessary precondition for, the manifesting of the disease. So for various reasons, but mainly because I do not think the whole social purpose has been adequately addressed in the Opposition's amendment, the Government will not be accepting this particular amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, it is very obvious from the two amendments that you have before you&mdash;the one now under consideration from the Australian Democrats, and the one that I have foreshadowed on this particular clause&mdash;that we are at odds and do not agree on this particular matter. The unjustifiable hardship provision has attracted criticism, in particular, from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The Chamber believes that `the onus of proof should squarely fall on the applicant in all cases, not the respondent'. Last Friday, the Chamber's legal officer, Mr Reg Hamilton, told the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our view is that with basic liberties, employers as well as others should be innocent until substantive evidence is produced to the contrary.</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition supports that view. After the consideration of this amendment by Senator Lees, I will seek to amend the Bill to ensure that the onus of proof rests with the claimant. I also draw the attention of the chamber to further comments by Mr Hamilton to the Standing Committee last Friday and, in particular, to one I thought would have attracted the Australian Democrats. I quote Mr Hamilton's comment from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have three tests for this sort of legislation&mdash;and perhaps for others. The first is that the legislation must be consistent with Australian legal traditions of civil liberties, which includes, for example, the fact that the onus of proof should rest on the applicant, not on the respondent; the law must also be clear on its application, and precise, so that an employer or anybody else knows exactly what must be complied with.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hamilton then went on to talk about other tests that applied to the legislation. Further in his evidence, Mr Hamilton said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have suggested that the unjustifiable hardship aspect be a part of the prohibition rather than a defence&mdash;and that is that onus of proof argument; if it is a defence, basically the employer bears an onus. It should be, in our view, part of the offence&mdash;the original prohibition.</PARA>
<PARA>Very obviously, there is a profound difference of view on this particular clause between the Opposition and the Democrats. I am certainly not in a position to support the amendment proposed by Senator Lees. </PARA>

<SPEECH PAGE="1891" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Tasmania-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Minister for Justice)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP> (10.44 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to this particular matter, it is a not unusual situation where the Government finds itself in the middle and is, therefore, probably correct in its way of dealing with the question of the onus of proof. I agree with Senator Tambling and other honourable senators that the question of the onus of proof is indeed very central to the way in which our legal system and paralegal systems operate. That is because it is important to have principles governing, not only as in this case, disability discrimination, but also a method of demonstrating that the discrimination based on disability does exist, and a method of ensuring that persons are not unjustifiably accused of such discrimination&mdash;with the consequences that follow as to its then being stigmatised as unlawful conduct in which they have engaged&mdash;with all sorts of consequences that may flow from the determination of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of the burden of proof is extremely important. In general, of course, the Government accepts for this legislation the principle that the persuasive burden&mdash;the burden which, at the end of the day, has to be satisfied before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission can find that discrimination because of disability has occurred&mdash;has to rest on the claimant. It has to rest on the person with a grievance. It has to rest on the person who lodges the complaint. That person, at the end of the day, has to show that there was a discrimination based on disability. But there is an exemption or an exception, in the case of a person against whom that charge is laid, where the Commission is satisfied that an unjustifiable hardship would be imposed on the respondent. The question is: how is that unjustifiable hardship to be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Government says is that we should adopt a very normal, ordinary way of the presentation of matters before a tribunal. That is to say that the respondent&mdash;the person who it is alleged engaged in unjustifiable discrimination based on disability and who wants the tribunal to conclude that there would be unjustifiable hardship if he had to change his practice&mdash;has to bring forward some evidence of that unjustifiable hardship, has to make it a live issue, has to make it more than an assertion, and has to give some reality and flesh to the claim of unjustifiable hardship. It would then be up to the claimant to show that, in fact, the hardship would not be unjustifiable in the way that the respondent was trying to demonstrate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very simple, ordinary way of making the matter something that is worthy of the tribunal's consideration and attention, requiring its deliberation and leading to a determination on that issue, otherwise there could be mere assertion. We say that the respondent&mdash;in this case, perhaps a member of the organisation which Senator Tambling, as its spokesman, has quoted&mdash;could not just get up and assert that there would be unjustifiable hardship, but would have to give it some substance. Then it would be up to the claimant to show that, in the overall examination of the matter, it would be found that there was no unjustifiable hardship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I ought to draw to the attention of honourable senators the explanatory memorandum to clause 99. I referred to it in the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs on Friday, but I would like to get it into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> today. Clause 99 of the Bill reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In determining whether an act is unlawful under a provision of Part 2, the Commission is not required to have regard to any exception or exemption provided for in that Part unless there is evidence before the Commission that the exception or exemption is or may be applicable in relation to that act.</PARA>
<PARA>The explanatory memorandum reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This clause provides that before the Commission is required to consider if the exemptions or exceptions that are set out in the legislation apply when it is deciding on whether or not certain action is unlawful under this Bill, the person who seeks to rely on this exception or exemption must produce some credible evidence that the exception or exemption may in fact apply in the particular case.</PARA>
<PARA>This very helpful example is then provided:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A has made a complaint against B alleging that B has discriminated against A on the basis that B would not provide a ramp to allow A access to B's retail store. If B wishes to rely on the exemption set out in Clause 11 concerning imposing unjustifiable hardship then B will be required to provide evidence as to its financial circumstances and the estimate of expenditure required before the Commission would have to take account of the unjustifiable hardship provisions.</PARA>
<PARA>We think that is very moderate and ought to be accepted by the Opposition. But, for the reasons that I have outlined, neither the amendments suggested to the Committee by the Democrats nor those suggested by the Opposition are acceptable to the Government. We believe that the Committee should accept clause 99. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments go to the issue of disability standards. The Opposition believes that the disability standards should come before Parliament in an amendable form rather than merely a disallowable form, which they would take if the legislation stood and regulations were put down in this order. We received widespread support for this proposal during the hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs last week. I am sure that honourable senators who attended that Committee or anyone who has read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will note that I pursued just about every witness on this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee is faced with yet another change in the way in which the Senate has operated for close to 93 years. Where regulations are made under legislation, this chamber should exercise that very powerful weapon of moving a disallowance motion. This is the way in which the Senate normally indicates to Executive Government that it believes that subsidiary legislation ought to be rejected, redrafted and introduced again at a later date&mdash;according to a timetable&mdash;in such a way that it does not have the same features that have led a majority of the Senate to support a disallowance motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reject the idea that was put forward by Senator Tambling at the beginning of his contribution to today's committee stage debate that extensive consultation was not undertaken. I believe that it was undertaken. In relation to the draft Bill that was introduced into the House in May, another round of extensive consultation took place then. I think that that is indicated by the number of submissions that came forward and were considered by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same process of consultation that has led to the compiling of a very acceptable Bill&mdash;in so far as those who have disabilities are concerned&mdash;will continue in the development of the standards. There will be plenty of time to give parties an opportunity to comment on the proposed text of any standards, before they are formally enacted as such. We do not believe that there is reason for this further manifestation of power&mdash;I was going to call it a novel power, but it is hardly novel any more&mdash;proposed for the Senate and the House of Representatives, whereby either of them, as I understand it on this amendment, could move amendments to a proposed disability standard.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be supporting these amendments put forward by Senator Tambling. The reason that these provisions are now no longer a rarity is that over time&mdash;particularly, more recently&mdash;this chamber has clearly considered that the disallowance provisions are inadequate. They are inadequate for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the inability of the chamber to discern, by resolution, what ought to stay in regulations and what ought to come out. Because of the problems with the Standing Orders, and the difficulty in excising those parts of regulations which are unsatisfactory, while retaining those which are satisfactory, there is need for another procedure, and this is that procedure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again I refer to the proposals that I advanced for amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act for the purposes of dealing with this problem. Until such time as those proposals are properly considered, I believe it incumbent upon the Senate to include more of these sorts of provisions in legislation. I believe that these provisions will also ensure a more open analysis of the formulation of proposals for disability standards. It is all very well for the department or the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission simply to write to various groups and peak bodies, to forward to them the proposed disability standards and to ask them for comment. That is one thing but, in my view, that is not genuine consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there should a more structured approach to this issue. There should be a round table approach, or several round table approaches in various States. Instead of having one central organisation sending out material and getting responses by letter, all this being done behind closed doors with the public not knowing what is going on, there should be an open approach. Consultations and discussions should take place in an atmosphere where the public and organisations that are concerned about matters affecting persons with disabilities can quiz the representatives of the department or the Commission in a semiformal way and where notes can be taken about the real intentions behind the standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Failing all of that, and even given that, it is important that the Parliament, which after all represents the community as a whole and which is supporting this legislation, should be capable of ensuring and should be motivated to ensure that the proper disability standards are formulated. The nursing homes legislation is an example of where this sort of thing was included. I ask honourable senators whether there has been any problem with that legislation. I do not think there has been. So why not do it in this case? People eventually went away, not completely satisfied, but that appears to have worked reasonably well. Why can it not work reasonably well on this occasion?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are all of one mind about removing the obstacles that have been erected in front of persons with disabilities, we can keep that motivation going in ensuring that disability standards are properly formulated. If they are not, we can deal with them in this chamber and in the other place in the manner proposed by Senator Tambling. </PARA>

<PARA>The medical profession is deeply concerned about the lack of protection afforded by this legislation. The AMA says that the treatment or procedure for a known HIV positive patient may need to be different and consequently may be regarded as discrimination. Similarly, the Australian Association of Surgeons is concerned that the Disability Discrimination Bill 1992 would make it illegal for a surgeon to refuse to perform an elective procedure on a known HIV positive patient. We have addressed these concerns in the amendments that are now before the Committee so that they afford protection to people where there is a reasonable belief of harm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw attention to the evidence on Friday before the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. When the AMA was appearing before the Committee, Senator Herron raised this issue very specifically. He referred to the AMA submission and quoted from that submission, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There remains a need for special exemption from the legislation vis-a-vis medical and allied services. Particularly in regard to the Minister's Second Reading Speech reference to HIV and AIDS, the health professions need greater protection than is currently afforded in the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>In response to a question from Senator Herron to the AMA, Dr Flecknoe-Brown responded, and I quote his response from page SCA9 of 9 October:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have one persisting concern about clause 45 and about what is to be considered a public health matter. It is not actually clause 45, it is clause 48. Earlier in the AMA submission, there was some distinction between actions taken to protect your own health and actions to protect public health. But I would have said that any action taken to prevent transmission of disease from one person to another is rightly considered a public health measure. But it would be helpful to have that clarified so that smaller scale actions suggesting that a certain member of the family uses different cutlery from other members of the family in cases of hepatitis A are still considered as covered by this public health exemption.</PARA>
<PARA>That example highlights the fact that this issue of reasonable belief of harm needs to be addressed. I am sure a number of other examples could be given that would go broader than the area of health professionals or medical people. Two examples came up in discussion with me. One was the provision of services by a late night pharmacist who might have to deal with a psychiatrically disabled customer. There could be grounds there. Similarly, a bus driver could be providing services to a disabled person. So there are situations that could well arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the amendments we have proposed to clause 45 and clause 48 address this issue. In clause 48 of the Bill which deals specifically with infectious diseases, we propose to add the words `including the health of any person providing a health care service'. Again, an example that was pointed out to me was that there could well be risks to receptionists in medical surgeries and similar situations. I seek support for these important amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that Senator Tambling has raised a valid concern. The question is whether the Bill sufficiently provides a mechanism which can deal with the sorts of situations which he illustrated to the Committee. The fact is that under clause 11(a) of the Bill there is already a provision for those who are in a situation, as they think, on reasonable grounds, of some jeopardy if they deal with somebody with a disability in a way which might be claimed to be discriminatory. If they have to deal with such a person, there is already a mechanism there to indicate that they can claim that to render a service to the disabled person would cause unjustifiable hardship. Unjustifiable hardship is defined in further detail to point to an ability to show that the nature of the detriment, in this case, likely to be accrued or be suffered by any person concerned, amounts to an unjustifiable hardship. It is the belief of the Government that that detriment refers to a physical or mental detriment that might be suffered by a person who would otherwise have to provide the service&mdash;a refusal to provide the service could lead to a determination that the refusal was unlawful&mdash;to the disabled person.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that there is sufficient capacity within the legislation, as drafted, to deal with the sorts of detriment that might be caused&mdash;the fear of contracting a disease, of being in a situation of physical vulnerability or of being in a situation that might cause mental stress or distress. All of that can be dealt with by the person against whom a charge of unlawful discrimination, on the grounds of disability, is made. To go to the onus of proof matters that we discussed earlier, this simply indicates and makes it a live issue that having to provide that service would have given rise to an unjustifiable hardship&mdash;in this case, perhaps, a detriment to health. I think that that is a perfectly sensible way for the Bill to structure dealing with that series of matters that Senator Tambling has raised. Therefore, the Government rejects the amendment. </PARA>

Therefore, we do not see any need for these amendments, although I understand that there are many groups in the community, particularly those in the medical profession, which still have some very real concerns. We cannot build into this Bill more and more opt-outs which effectively weaken what we are trying to do and which will prevent genuine cases from being dealt with and prevent people who have a specific disability from receiving the services that they need.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised at the comments of the Government and the Democrats on this particular matter. In looking carefully at clause 11 and clause 45, and the associated explanatory memorandum that has been distributed, I see that there is no acknowledgment of the issue of health professionals or of the services that apply to the provision of health standards. Naturally, with the new definitions at the commencement of the legislation, it incorporates, as a definition of disability, the very important new emphasis on disease or illness. Therefore, there is a compounded and associated concern.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would again highlight that the explanatory memorandum makes no mention whatsoever, under the issues relating to unjustifiable hardship or in the explanatory memorandum comments on clause 45 with regard to exemptions and special measures, of the protection that ought to be afforded to health professions and people associated with these areas. The Democrats and the Government are relying on lawyers' language and on formal phrases and have certainly not given any commitment to have this matter properly addressed.

<PARA>The explanatory memorandum to that clause reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not intended that this Act will interfere with the operation of public health laws which relate to the control of infectious diseases. Infectious diseases would include HIV/AIDS. Where it is reasonably necessary to discriminate against a person with a disability so as to protect public health then this clause does not make such discrimination unlawful.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where there is a prospect or a situation of vulnerability in that an infectious disease could be transmitted from one person, a patient seeking treatment, to another, the health professional concerned, then quite clearly that is a matter of public health. Clause 48 would offer a range of reassurance, I believe, to those who have made the sorts of submissions to which Senator Tambling has spoken. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot agree with the Minister. He would recall that earlier, when we were considering amendments to the definition on health, I sought to change that very definition to relate to infectious disease. My amendment was lost. The Minister is now relying, in clause 48, on the excuse of infectious disease&mdash;(a) and (b) must be read together in the way in which they are presented&mdash;and public health. The argument that was established very clearly by members of the medical profession in all of their submissions and in their very serious concerns expressed to the Committee was that clause 48 does not go far enough for the protection of health professionals. Therefore, again I express surprise and concern that the Government and the Democrats will not support this amendment, which seeks to clarify that particular matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>These amendments are perhaps some of the most important amendments from a list of about nine or 10 that the Democrats originally presented to the Committee on Friday. Being left with these amendments only on the exemptions does not mean to say that we are no longer concerned about, for example, the exemption relating to the armed forces. However, as the Standing Committee on Community Affairs heard on Friday, the telecommunications exemption would have cut out some two million Australians who have a significant hearing loss. If we add to that those who have significant speech difficulties, we see that there is a very large group in the community who need some assistance to use a telephone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many of those people there is a very simple solution, but a very large number of them need to move on to more specific and specialised services, such as the provision of a TTY. For some time now in Adelaide a voluntary service has been available, but unfortunately the queue for this service is often three or more hours long. I acknowledge that the Government has provided some $300,000 in the Budget towards a survey of TTY needs, but that is totally inadequate. With this Bill before us, there is an excellent opportunity to open up to that large section of the community ordinary telephone access. This access is needed not just for emergency services, whether it is to call an ambulance or to contact the police; it is also needed for the day to day community services to which these people should have access. That may be to contact the local school to see what the kids are up to or perhaps just to keep in touch with relatives and friends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not suggesting through these amendments that all of these people will get services because, as has already been pointed out, the unjustifiable hardship provision in this Bill means that it is quite a lengthy process for each individual to prove that he or she really needs the service and that he or she has been discriminated against. If they wish to claim, they then have to prove&mdash;in this case I presume it is Telecom, as Optus is not really in this area of the market&mdash;that there is unjustifiable hardship in providing that service. I imagine that some of the financial impact statements we have seen are very much exaggerated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are watered down from the Democrats' original amendment. Originally, we proposed that the entire exemption be removed. At the Committee hearing some figures were presented to us by two of the groups. Some $182m was the estimated cost if everybody had to have immediate access to all telecommunications services. We have watered down our original amendment by leaving in the exemption regarding `payphones and public payphones'. Our original amendment would have left everything out. We now acknowledge that cost has been one of the major problems that the Government has had in accepting this amendment. Payphones and public payphones apparently accounted for $150m of the $182m. Even with what is left, the Democrats argue that that is still an inflated figure. That presumes that absolutely everybody who needs a service will come in immediately. That will not and cannot happen the way this legislation is written. It is victim based legislation. Each individual must prove that he or she needs the service and is being discriminated against. Then the respondent has the onus of establishing unjustifiable hardship if the respondent does not want to provide the service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments will at least enable people who do not now have access to telecommunications to have that access in their own home. Three years down the track, I hope we will see a very rapid move to make payphones and public payphones accessible to anybody who needs what is really an essential service in Australia today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to indicate the Opposition's support for the Democrats' amendments. This is an important issue. It was certainly an issue that we addressed and were very concerned about. My colleague Mr Warwick Smith, the shadow Minister for communications, had an exchange of correspondence with Telecom in August in which he sought to obtain the costing on this matter. I tabled a response to Mr Smith dated 17 August in the hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs on Friday. It concerned me, and I am sure that it concerned many of my colleagues, that we were bluffed. We were told that the information was not available. However, in the evidence last Friday, as Senator Lees has said, we did elicit from two witnesses some very important information. Mr Damian Lacey, the chief executive officer of the Royal South Australian Deaf Society, appeared before the Committee as a witness for ACROD last Friday and gave some very interesting evidence. Mr Lacey said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that AOTC's costings are in the order of $182m. I will quickly run through that: $6m on current provisions of disability programs; $2.2m to extend their current product range in the gaps that they have already identified in a broad range of speech and physical and hearing impairment areas; $8m for TTY equipment, that is, for profoundly deaf people; $150m for payphones, and $16m for TTY relay services. We believe that those figures are a little bit of an exaggeration, to say the least, and we believe that a significant improvement in access can be achieved through the expenditure of some $20m to $30m over a two-year or three-year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise the issue of TTY equipment. Roughly $8m is roughly the cost of providing an additional 12,000 TTYs to deaf Australians to enable them to get access to the phone system.</PARA>
<PARA>When I questioned Mr Lacey about his figuring and asked him on what basis he had obtained that information, he replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am a member of Telecom's disability consultative committee. There is only a small group of us who meet at the disability programs and consumer consultation level with Telecom. It is a subcommittee of the Telecom Australia Consultative Council.</PARA>
<PARA>I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Was that $182m identified to you by Telecom?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>I asked him when, and he replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a meeting two or three weeks ago in Melbourne of our disability services committee.</PARA>
<PARA>It is indeed a pity that we were not able to obtain, and the Government was not able to provide, the costings&mdash;which very obviously, as Mr Lacey indicated, were made available to the Government&mdash;as part of the earlier considerations of this Bill when Mr Smith was seeking them for the debate in the House of Representatives. As Senator Lees said, it is an important issue that should be read with this. All of the normal exemptions will be available to Telecom to argue in other and appropriate ways, and we will be supporting the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I briefly add my voice in support of these amendments, largely on the basis that the reasons given by the Government during the progress of this legislation, in which I have taken some interest, having regard to negotiations being undertaken with the introduction of competition in telecommunications in this country, fall rather flat in 1992. Those reasons may have had some validity at the beginning of the process of consultation surrounding the lead-up to this Bill because that did coincide with the earlier period of negotiations on the opening up of Australia's telecommunications. That was a fairly controversial move in any case, but it was one of the good economic rationalist moves to which this country has been subjected over the life of this Government and one strongly supported by the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that process it was always important to ensure that the universal service obligation of telecommunications carriers up until that point met by Telecom Australia, and met well by international standards, should not be diminished. The strongest evidence of all to those of us who were concerned about reduction in the universal service, about haziness over what constituted community service obligations by the telecommunications carriers, is this piece of legislation. The Disability Discrimination Bill having come forward in 1992, after the introduction of competition and the Telecommunications Act of 1991, the Government should have much more readily moved in the direction that these amendments moved the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Lees said, they do not go all the way. Those of us in this chamber who are concerned about both the rights of the disabled in our community and also the obligations of our telecommunications carriers with regard to universal service must keep an eye on developments with regard to public and pay phones. Certainly I commit myself, along with others in this chamber, to that process. So it is on that basis in particular that I speak briefly in support of these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the range of disabilities we come across, one of the most difficult to comprehend and to imaginatively sympathise with&mdash;to put oneself in the position of a person with such a disability&mdash;is the world of the deaf, the world of those who are very severely impaired in their hearing capacity, and to an extent those who have a speech impediment or difficulty which prevents them from communicating in a normal way. But it is those who are severely impaired in hearing who inhabit a world that most of us cannot imagine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had my education in this matter primarily through my acquaintance with the Tasmanian Deaf Society, and particularly in recent times with Mr Peter Cipollone, the executive director of that society, who has been a tireless worker on behalf of the Tasmanian community. He invited me during Deafness Awareness Week to launch the funding proposal that came out of the Budget, which was designed to improve dramatically communication for Australia's profoundly deaf and speech impaired. I am referring to the $300,000 pilot program for extending the benefits of the telephone typewriter system. The Commonwealth funded pilot project is to test a relay service arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who do not know how this facility would work, a person who is deaf or severely impaired in normal speech or hearing would be able to communicate by telephone typewriter. They type in their message, which is relayed by the phone system. In this particular project, the typewritten message would be received by the interpreter service already conducted by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. The person in that service would then relay the message on to a person who has full hearing, receive a message back, and then type the message back to the deaf person. It is amazing technology and it is a wonderful way in which those who have this disability can engage not only in ordinary social intercourse with their friends and relatives and associates but also in business and other activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention that project because I believe that it is a demonstration of the good faith of the Federal Government in relation to these matters. Indeed, it is only a foundation for the sorts of assistance we wish to encourage&mdash;the dismantling of the barriers, the removal of impediments to the full participation of those with disabilities in Australian society, in this case particularly those with severe hearing impairment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, having held discussions with Mr Howe and Mr Collins over the last few hours, the Federal Government is prepared to accept these amendments. We believe that it is an absolutely vital breakthrough on the part of those suffering from these disabilities. We believe that it is the only proper response we can require as an Australian community of those who are vested with the tremendous privilege, commercially but also socially, of providing telecommunications services for all Australians. We have come to the view that, building on the goodwill and good faith already demonstrated in the pilot program I have outlined and keeping in mind the general social purpose of this Bill, it would be proper to bring within the Bill the providers of telecommunications services in the way suggested in the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What that means has to be understood. It will mean that a person who considers that he or she has been discriminated against on the grounds of the disability, in this case severe deafness or a speech impediment which prevents them from ordinary and normal use of the telephone, would be able to approach the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and lodge a complaint if a facility had not been provided to enable that communication to take place across the telephone wires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be emphasised, as I did before the Standing Committee on Community Affairs last Friday, that Telecom, for example, as the provider of the service could argue unjustifiable hardship. The figures, of which we have had only an indication, and not in a formal way and not under the pressure that Telecom would certainly be under in that formal setting of the Commission, would be presented. As I have said in previous contributions to this debate, Telecom or any other provider of services would have to indicate that indeed there was unjustifiable hardship&mdash;make it a live issue; give credibility to that assertion&mdash;and that would be a proper discipline on the organisation concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, I would imagine that, with the passage of the legislation in the form from which it will emerge from this Committee and then from the Parliament, it would be sensible for the provider of the telecommunications service to take advantage of those provisions of the Bill which enable the organisation, as a service provider, to put forward action plans which include provisions relating to the devising of policies and programs to achieve the objects of the Act; the communication of these policies and programs to persons within the service provider; the review of practices within the service provider with a view to the identification of any discriminatory practices; and the setting of goals and targets, where these may reasonably be determined against which the success of the plan in achieving the objects of the Act may be assessed; and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Committee has achieved during the course of this morning's deliberations and on this particular matter is indeed very noteworthy. It is compassionate, but by that I do not want to say that there is not an issue of justice involved. It is not simply a matter of sentiment; it is a matter of ensuring that those who would otherwise be in a most isolated situation within the Australian community are able to take advantage of that which so many of us take for granted as a matter of course&mdash;that is, communication through the telephone system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has given me great pleasure to be able to inform the Committee of this very recent decision by the Government. On the part of both Mr Howe and Senator Collins, there has been a full understanding of the arguments as they have unfolded, properly, over the last several weeks. I want to pay particular tribute to Miss Heather Butow who, I think, has done a tremendous job, not only in this particular matter, but in relation to the construction of this Bill, together with Kym Duggan from the human rights area of the Attorney-General's Department. But, principally, in this matter, Miss Heather Butow has achieved a great deal for the disabled throughout Australia and I believe it ought to be recorded in the annals of the Senate today. </PARA>

We may find that Telecom is in fact quite pleased that it will have the opportunity to corner a section of the market before any other player takes an interest in this particular type of service because, as has been found overseas with similar legislation, it actually generates income for the provider and it spreads throughout the community a service in which many people previously would not have been involved and to which they would not have had access.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is nice to see that we do not have to divide on this clause. As the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, has said, if it is due to the work of the staff of the Minister&mdash;and also the Minister himself&mdash;that we can achieve that, then I think it does reflect well on the processes of the Senate. It emphasises the importance of the Senate in being able to review legislation in a more cooperative manner than may sometimes happen in the other place. It shows that we can work together to achieve something that, basically, we all believe is just and fair and which does have checks and balances built into it for Telecom, as the Minister has said. It also gives people with disabilities an opportunity if they believe they have been discriminated against on this basis. </PARA>

I imagine that there would have been many in the Government, in the bureaucracy and probably in the Minister's office who may have argued very strongly for this provision never to have been in the legislation anyway, and it was only a matter of costing and finances of various people that probably meant that it emerged in the first place as a sort of budget check and balance. </PARA>

I imagine that the definition of disability would embrace the sort of incapacity from which the person described by Senator O'Chee would be suffering. But that, in itself, does not give rise to any ability to approach the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. What then has to be done is to link that to an act of discrimination on the part of a person, which discrimination is related to that particular disability. It is only then that one gets into the stage of a determination by the Commission that such discrimination is unlawful. It is very hard to know what particular case the honourable senator has in mind but that would be a case which, if it resulted in discrimination in the provision of housing or accommodation, for example, could result in a successful application by the person to the Commission for a determination that such discrimination was unlawful.</PARA></TALK.START>

In relation to other matters, it is expressed in terms of the inherent requirements of the job. For example, the disability may make it impossible for a person to become a driving instructor with the Commonwealth car fleet. If someone could not tell the difference between red and green he would probably be something of a failure as an instructor. Where the inherent characteristics of the job require a certain capacity, that has to be given precedence, although it would also be true to say that, with the modern technology and devices and aids of a therapeutic kind that are available, that area might be narrowing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows </EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill contains a number of proposed amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984, which are necessary in order to respond to certain recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and to resolve various practical problems which have arisen in the course of electoral administration. It also repeals the requirement introduced last year for the distribution of a `handbook' containing information about candidates and their policies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will repeal the requirement that documents containing information about candidates be delivered to all households prior to the next election. Section 386a of the Commonwealth Electoral Act was inserted last year as a result of an amendment moved by the Australian Democrats during debate on the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supported the amendment because it formed a part of what may be seen as a package of measures, which included freetime broadcasts, designed to ensure that the electorate was informed in the absence of political advertising of candidates' policies in the election. With the disallowance by the High Court of the legislation to ban political advertising, the case for the candidate booklet no longer exists.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Electoral Act already provides for a free issue of the electoral roll, in computer format if required, to senators, members, registered political parties, and other persons and organisations deemed appropriate by the Electoral Commission, after each general election. This Bill will allow for the free, regular provision of supplements to the roll, in computer format, to all senators, members, and registered political parties which have parliamentary representation. Other groups will be able to obtain these supplements at cost. Habitation indexes are already issued free of charge by the Electoral Commission to registered political parties once in the life of a parliament. The Bill will allow for additional issues of the habitation index to registered political parties at cost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, in response to current concerns about privacy issues, this Bill will also provide that where computerised roll information on names and addresses is provided by the Electoral Commission to senators, members and registered political parties, that information must only be used for purposes related to enrolment and to elections and referendums. Penalties are provided for the misuse of the information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its report on the 1990 Federal election, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters recommended that scrutineers be permitted to examine a `two-candidate preferred vote' in order to ascertain the likely outcome of the election on polling night. For various reasons relating to the integrity and efficiency of the scrutiny process and to facilitate equal access by all observers on election night, the Electoral Commission concluded, and the Government agrees, that it is more appropriate for Electoral Commission officers rather than scrutineers to conduct an indicative distribution of second and later preference votes for the House of Representatives on election night. This will provide the public on that night with an early indication of the two-candidate preferred result in most electorates. This legislation will provide a mechanism for the Australian Electoral Commission to conduct such an indicative distribution of preferences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its May 1991 report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">United Nations Peacekeeping and Australia</EMPHASIS>, the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recommended that an explicit function be conferred on the Australian Electoral Commission to provide assistance to foreign countries and international organisations in the conduct of elections and referendums in cases where such assistance is approved by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Bill will confer such a function.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also empower the Australian Electoral Commission to provide goods and services to members of the public and organisations in a manner not inconsistent with the performance of its primary functions. Such goods might include the provision of public roll information, and such services might include providing a roll scanning service to State electoral authorities. In the light of the recent report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters which recommended greater cooperation between Federal and State and Territory electoral authorities, legislation to permit the Electoral Commission to provide goods and services to those State and Territory electoral authorities is desirable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with the Government's commitment to the `user pays' principle, the Bill will also empower the Australian Electoral Commission to impose charges for the provision of goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also provides for a new system of automatic enrolment of new citizens. At the time of applying for citizenship, a person will be able to make a provisional claim for electoral enrolment. The provisional claim for enrolment will be activated once the person concerned has been granted citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Bill includes a number of proposed minor amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act to improve the efficiency of the electoral process and to resolve certain practical difficulties in electoral administration.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we interrupted the debate last night, I was examining the Government's overall track record in the 2 1/2 years since our last Federal election, an overall track record that does not give anyone&mdash;any sane, rational person in this place or any other place&mdash;reason to have confidence in the performance of this Government; nor does it give any sane or rational person reason to have confidence in the capability of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to perform his job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recounted yesterday how Mr Keating, shortly after becoming Prime Minister, said that he had a vision for Australia and that his vision included a more independent Australia. Yet this is the same Prime Minister who goes to Japan but a month ago and says to the Japanese, `We will not enter into any trade agreement which is detrimental to Japan's interests'. Is this the idea of independence that Mr Keating has for this nation? I should hope not, because that is not independence. That is merely swapping one set of values based on adherence to a particular nation's interests with another set of values based on adherence to another nation's interests. What this nation needs is a government that will act in the interests of this nation&mdash;in the interests of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government needs a sense of duty to the future of Australia and to the future of our economy. Yet we have seen no evidence of that sense of duty in the Budget the Government has brought before Parliament. We have seen no evidence of that sense of duty in the way in which it has conducted its economic program. We have this year in the Budget, on the Government's own figures, a deficit projected to be $13.4 billion. How much is $13.4 billion? That amount, if paid for in $1 coins laid end to end, would go around the world 8 1/2 times. That is the deficit for just this financial year, on the Government's own figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that the financing requirement&mdash;the obligation of the Commonwealth to borrow&mdash;will exceed that amount of money. It will go as high perhaps as $18 billion or more. Where is this money coming from? Where is the Government going to source this money? It is going to be sourced, if one looks at how the Government intends to go to the markets, in the largest ever bond raising program in the history of Australia. The Government is going to source the money by going out and borrowing more in bonds in one year than has ever been done in one program in the entire history of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the sort of achievement of growth that the Government wants, then yes, it has got it. It has managed to help our foreign debt grow and our public debt grow more than any other government has in the history of this nation. That is great growth! It is great growth for the bankers and great growth for the speculators, but not great growth for the future of our economy. It is not great for the next generation of Australians, who will be expected to bear the financial burden of this Government's economic neglect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not need to remind the chamber that it is the people who are currently at school, who will be leaving school this year, who have, hopefully, 40 years of working life ahead of them, who will pay the taxes to support this Government's profligate borrowing. They are the people who will live with the consequences, not the tired old Ministers on the other side of the Senate chamber, nor the tired old Ministers on the Government's front bench in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the young people of Australia, the people with their working lives ahead of them, who will bear the cost in the higher government taxes that will be necessary under this Government to repay the debt it has clocked up just this year. It is the young people of Australia who will bear the consequences of this Government's economic mismanagement through its failed industrial relations policy, the young people of Australia&mdash;like my brother, like my sister&mdash;who face the prospect of leaving education or universities with no guarantee of employment; and not just no guarantee of employment next month or next year, but no guarantee of employment maybe for years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government's failed policies have condemned a generation of Australians to a future without the dignity of work and to a future without the dignity of their own financial independence. When one looks at this Government's track record in that sense, one must ask: does this Government deserve the money it asks Parliament to give it? I think one could very reasonably be excused for thinking that it does not. Yet it is the Government. It comes before us and says, `We need more money for this program. We need more money for that program'. We on this side of the chamber say to the Government, `Why do we need a Budget deficit this year of $13.4 billion? Why do we need a financing requirement this year in excess of $18 billion?'. I note the entrance into the chamber of my learned colleague Senator Watson. Senator Watson knows full well the full extent of the financial profligacy of this Government. When this Government comes here and asks for that money and we query it, it says time and time again, `This is the money we need to spend to create jobs'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the question: does the spending of money by the Government necessarily create jobs? Even if it does create jobs, is it the best way to create jobs? This is what the debate is really about. Those of us on this side of the chamber believe there is a better way to create jobs and that is by taking taxes off individuals, by taking taxes off employers, and by giving ordinary working men and women the opportunity to work for their own benefit and, as Senator Watson says, to give them an environment in which they can flourish. That surely must be the best policy for government. The policy that is espoused says tthat only the Government can create jobs and that the only way in which the Government can create jobs is by spending taxpayers' money or, in this case, borrowed money&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a bandaid. But more than that, it is fundamentally flawed because it is based on the assumption that the Government is the best deliverer of jobs. If that were the case, why have we seen the collapse of socialist countries behind the Iron Curtain over the last five years? Why have we seen, even in China, the bastion of Marxism, a movement away from a controlled economy and towards a free enterprise economy? The answer is that even in China, even the tired old men in the Forbidden City, recognise that one cannot put a yoke on the aspirations of ordinary people for a better existence. Rather than try to constrain the aspirations of ordinary people, the best thing a government can do is take advantage of the aspirations of ordinary people, take advantage of their desire to increase their individual wealth, and recognise that, if 17 million Australians are given the opportunity to increase their individual wealth, they will, of course, increase the common wealth of this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what we on this side of the chamber say. We say there is an alternative, an alternative based on hope instead of an alternative based on a government that can only tax and borrow. We say that there is an alternative based on private enterprise instead of an alternative based on stimulating the economy by spending more money in the public sector, as this Government has tried to do. The money it spends, even if it is spent as efficiently as the money that the private sector could spend, does not create any extra jobs. With the money the Government takes out of the economy, be it through taxes or be it through soaking up the money that the banks would have lent to small businesses around the country, what it spends is merely money that others could have spent themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problem with high taxation policies such as we see from this Government, and have seen from this Government for the whole nine years it has been in office, is that taxation is nothing other than government ownership of an individual's labour, or of the profits of a business. But it is government ownership of one's labour without the Government making a contribution to assist the individual. Instead, the Government's economic policies are policies that are designed to restrict, rather than to assist, the individual. That is why one has to have doubts about whether this Government really does deserve the money which it will now undoubtedly get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to raise a couple of particular points because it is appropriate, in discussing the appropriations, to look at some of the wasteful ways in which this Government has spent the money. They are ways which I hope we will not see in future governments, ways which I am sure we will not see in the government that will be returned after the Federal election, because it will be a government formed from the people who currently sit on this side of the chamber. Look at the way in which the Government has thrown money willy-nilly at this lobby group and that lobby group to buy their votes. We have seen in the State of Western Australia&mdash;and I note the presence in the chamber of Senator Knowles and Senator Crane&mdash;how the Government gave last year, from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, $19,700 to the Manungka Manungka women's cooperative.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has occurred during the period of those three analyses and, obviously, before I became a member of the Senate? We see a debt ridden nation. We see a nation ridden with unemployment. We see business bankruptcies higher than they have ever been before.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the options, the alternatives, that we on this side of the chamber have put on the table? We have put a business plan on the table for Australia. We put that business plan on the table over 12 months ago; and it has been open to scrutiny, analysis and a whole range of comments. What do we get from the Government about that? We get a range of scare tactics, because it cannot put in place anything that matches the vision or the wisdom of that particular plan. What does that plan give? It gives hope. It gives freedom. </PARA>

In this country, an employer cannot even come to an agreement with his employees, or vice versa, without having unions and the Industrial Relations Commission involved. That is a fundamental breach of the freedom of the rights of individuals. The freedom to come to such agreements gives incentive. The coalition's business plan gives personal income tax cuts. It gives business tax cuts. It gives individuals the right to accept how they manage and run their affairs. It gives them the right, in fact, to control their own destiny. </PARA>

He can make his own arrangements, in a way that suits him, to get the job done and to suit his aspirations.

It will not only be my children who suffer from that: it will be his children and his grandchildren. They are the ones that are going to have to pay back the debt&mdash;not us.

It refers to high incomes and also to the Medicare levy, which has gone up by $2.88 a week for a single person on $100,000 per annum. The document also states that under Fightback there will be a penalty if one is uninsured. One can go on through this particular document and look at all of the aspects of it that have been balanced. Senator McMullan has obviously seen this. It also clearly points out that there are significant benefits under the health policies of the coalition that will improve the health position of many Australians. I am heartily sick and tired&mdash;when I go to places such as Bunbury, Esperance, Albany and Port Hedland, and elsewhere&mdash;of hearing about the long waiting lists that people have to put up with to get into hospitals. It should be the right of every individual to get into hospital quickly and efficiently. Under this Government, the health system is really in a mess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that the Government has spent an additional $9 billion this year. This roughly represents an increase of 6 per cent in real expenditure. There is a deterioration of $6 billion in the Budget deficit; it has gone from around $9 billion to around $15 billion. The gross Commonwealth public debt interest increases by 26 per cent over $1 billion in 1992-93 and by 33 per cent, around $1.6 billion, in the following year. The Government has abandoned its previous commitment to return the Budget to surplus by the middle of the decade. Do honourable senators remember what Mr Keating said some years ago about balanced budgets? Even with the indications of increased taxation, the Budget will remain significantly in deficit until 1995-96. The total deficits from 1991-92 to 1995-96 will be over $50 billion. That should be compared to the One Nation estimate of $18 billion for deficits over that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a little less than six months since the One Nation statement came out. The Government said then that the Budget deficit would blow out to about $18 billion over that four-year period. If one can believe the Budget that was brought down, we now find the Government has adjusted that by another minus $32 billion, in just six months. One is entitled to ask who does its number crunching, who does its accounting and how can it get things so wrong. These mistakes come from the Government's own paper. How can it get it so wrong?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two people principally responsible for this&mdash;one is our bankcard Prime Minister and the other is our shop until you drop Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). Do honourable senators remember when Mr Dawkins came out and said, `Go out and spend, spend, spend'? After the Government had driven everybody into the ground and almost destroyed them with high interest rate regimes, he comes out and tells us to spend instead of telling us to reduce debt. I say to people who have a mortgage or a business debt that if they get the opportunity to reduce that debt, they should make it their top priority. I say that from bitter personal experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are people sitting on both sides of this chamber who know that my family and I have been farming for a long time. We expanded our operation in 1984. The high interest rates of the Government&mdash;the people who sit on the other side&mdash;almost destroyed us. I can understand why people who have put their life savings into trying to do something for this nation get very upset when they see their life savings go down the drain because of government policy, government lack of understanding and because of a government that does not really care about a number of things. And there are many Australians who have had their life savings go down the drain during this period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us, for a moment&mdash;because I raised it earlier on&mdash;look at the changes we intend to make in the tax scales in lowering personal income tax. We are giving people the opportunity to make a decision about what they do with their money, rather than ripping it off them and saying that we as a government can spend it better than they can because we know how to manage it. We are not going to say, `We know how to manage your affairs better than you do'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting some of the changes that are going to occur. Let us look at phase 1 under our policies in terms of the tax cuts which will exist. First of all, we see that those people who have an annual income of $7,000 presently pay $320 tax; they will pay none so the gain per year will be $320, or 100 per cent. I will not read all of these out because of time. We go up to $15,000 and we find that the present tax is $1,920; that will be cut to $1,296, a saving of $624 per annum or a cut of 32.5 per cent. We look at people earning $25,000 and we find that currently they are paying $4,694; under our proposals it will be $3,509, a saving of $1,185 or a cut of $25.20 per week. One can go through the list&mdash;and it is all here for everybody to see&mdash;and one will find there are very significant tax cuts which will put dollars and cents back into people's pockets and give them the opportunity and the incentive to manage their own financial affairs and not have the Government managing them for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we move to business, we see the removal of the wholesale sales tax and payroll tax. Did not Senator Button get himself into a little bit of a mix yesterday on payroll tax? The removal of the fuel excise will save $11 per tank every time a motorist fills up the tank of an average sized car. But the real benefit from fuel excise is that it will be part of the measures that have to be taken to give our transport industry, whether it be rail or road, the opportunity to get somewhere near being internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that is one of the most important infrastructure reforms required in Australia. We do not have a competitive transport system and one of the principal reasons is we almost tax them off the road or off the rails. It is the highest taxed sector in this country of Australia which is so large and is populated in half a dozen places around the coastline, and yet its wealth basically comes from inland. Our producers pay an enormous penalty for this high taxing government and the level of tax that is paid, whether it be in the wholesale sales tax area, the flow-on effects of payroll tax or the fuel excise. </PARA>

The first thing is that in Victoria there is to be a new tier of apprentice Ministers or, in effect, Parliamentary Secretaries. At the same time as there is to be a cut to the politicians' support staff there is to be an increase in the amount paid to the people who will become Parliamentary Secretaries. There is also the suggestion that, if the occasion for a by-election occurs, that not take place but that there be simply a filling of that seat by a person from the party that the previous member had represented. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So there is no earthly justification for an expansion of the Ministry from 27 to 30. It will lead to bigger government, not smaller government. It will lead to less efficient management of government activities. It will lead to a further lessening of the role of the Parliament relative to the Executive, a constant trend for far too many years now. If we really believe in a parliamentary democratic system, it is about time we took it seriously and considered limiting the size of the Executive Government, and not continually expanding it.</PARA>
<PARA>It is on that basis, amongst others, that Senator Short opposed it. He reflected the position taken on that occasion by the coalition. It would seem appropriate, therefore, that the coalition, having adopted that view then and, I believe, still adhering to it, might raise in the forums of the Liberal Party the need for the Premier of Victoria to have another look, and a very close look, at the proposals that are being put there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice another statement here from Senator Short on a different but related issue. In Victoria a number of permanent heads have been stood aside and others brought in on the basis of a contractual arrangement. Senator Short, in his speech on 16 September 1987, again says something here that is worth noting in that respect:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only sure and certain protection against authoritarian rule in Australian Government is a professional, competent, career Public Service, independent of the favour of Ministers and conscious of its one specialised role in the conduct of public affairs.</PARA>
<PARA>The theme I am talking on today is not new. It is one that people opposite are very conscious of. I invite them to take up with the Premier of Victoria the expressions of their outrage&mdash;perhaps that is an adequate word&mdash;at what was happening, or what they saw was happening, in any event, in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems in this place is that we are members of parties&mdash;that is how we are voted in&mdash;and that makes it very difficult for us to act always as parliamentarians. But if, on issues such as this, we can put those party constraints aside in the interests of the parliamentary process, then some good may be done, and we may, in some way at least, act as we are supposed to. So I invite Senator Short, and any others who care to join him, to take that theme up. It was a theme that was accepted also by former Senator Chaney, the Leader of the coalition in the Senate at that time. On the issue of the Public Service, Mr McGauran, the honourable member for Gippsland in my home State, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Public Service will always let the Government think it has control, but whether, in reality, it has is a different matter. So the Government should not insult the intelligence of Opposition members by asserting in this Parliament, without any evidence, that because it will increase the size of the Ministry it will have greater control over public servants.In fact, I could assert just as easily that the reverse applies&mdash;the more Ministers there are, the less control the Government has, because there is more hiding away in all the corridors of our Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr McGauran is a distinguished representative of an electorate in Victoria. His party, the National Party, is now in coalition with the Liberal Party in Victoria to form a government. It may well be that he will take this matter up with his Party down there to see whether this considerable threat to the parliamentary system is turned aside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where the facilities of the executive, of Ministers, are increased, and the facilities of those parliamentarians who are not Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries are decreased, it symbolises the problem that faces Australia so much today; that is, the concentration is upon the executive and the legislature is devalued, or its contribution is devalued. It is proper for us as parliamentarians on both sides of the House to indicate in proper terms&mdash;let us not go into hyperbole&mdash;our disappointment, our concerns, perhaps even our outrage at what is happening there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, it is less easy for us to do this than the Opposition, whose parties are in power in Victoria now. Nevertheless, Opposition senators are already on the record as taking this approach, having so strongly expressed their points of view in 1987. I suppose it is simply a matter of honourable senators opposite referring their Victorian colleagues to what they so stoutly said in 1987. Let us hope there is a blow struck in the near future on behalf of all parliamentarians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon I speak on the process of the appointment of the new Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, during its wide-ranging inquiry into superannuation, was able to make an assessment of the ISC and make recommendations about its corporate capacity to cope with the ever increasing demands that it will face in the context of a rapidly growing superannuation industry. We know that as the industry grows, so will the scope for fraud, malpractice and inefficiency grow. Fundamental economics says that excessive growth can result in managerial diseconomies that can arise in large, fat bureaucracies. It is possible that if the industry is not properly regulated, negative influences can increase at a greater and disproportionate rate and ultimately cause harm to a substantial number of superannuants. These points highlight the need for a highly effective and efficient Insurance and Superannuation Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee found widespread dissatisfaction with the way the ISC was discharging its duties. Some of the complaints were systemic, that is, they were a product of the ISC's legislative charter, which was found to be limited and restrictive. Other complaints pointed to managerial and operational deficiencies. The consumer groups which came before the Committee saw the ISC as a captive of the industry, not prepared to intervene to correct injustices and excesses but rather eager to uphold the principle of caveat emptor&mdash;let the buyer beware&mdash;which in superannuation can work only to the detriment of the consumer. The inability of the ISC to handle RBL determinations and answer consumer inquiries in a timely way was also a major point of contention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's recommendation that a panel of commissioners be appointed was designed to ensure that the ISC has a policy formulation body that will make certain that the interests of all the key players in the superannuation game have their views taken into account and that the ISC's managerial output is monitored and given an element of quality control not previously evident. A related recommendation of the Committee was that the ISC embark on a program of retraining, staff development and recruitment, so that it could properly discharge its responsibilities, as we envisaged in our report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Safeguarding Super</EMPHASIS>. We know that the ISC was given a real boost in resources in the last Budget. We commend the Treasurer for that. But I am very worried about how those resources might be deployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe very strongly that the position of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner should have been advertised. I do not believe it is good enough simply to give it to somebody in Treasury. This allows people to continue to say that the ISC will remain a captive of Treasury. Many expert witnesses have appeared before our Select Committee. These witnesses have not had the opportunity to apply for the position. If we look at relatively recent comparable positions and appointments, we see that Mr Tony Hartnell, an expert corporate lawyer, was appointed to the Australian Securities Commission; and Professor Alan Fels, an experienced consumer advocate, was appointed to the Trade Practices Commission. There are excellent people available outside Treasury, well qualified to fill this position. I think it is absolutely regrettable that they have been denied the opportunity at least to apply for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday, Senator Button attempted to use and abuse Question Time to continue a debate that began in this chamber last week. He got Senator Bryant Burns to ask him a dorothy dixer relating to the automotive industry and attempted then to debate figures that I had used in speaking on the omnibus Bill entitled the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill 1992, which related to, among other things, extending the life of the Automotive Industry Authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said to Senator Button during Question Time, on a point of order, that I was more than happy to debate him any time, anywhere, any place, if he liked, to debate the use of the figures that I had used together with his figures and see where the actual debate really lay, but that I would not stand for Question Time being abused in that manner. So I have chosen today simply to refute the propositions that he put forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button spoke after me in the debate on that Bill last week and had every opportunity to dispute the figures I had used in my speech. He chose not to do so. Presumably, somebody must have got upset, or he must have got upset, about the fact that I said that his personal Button car plan had been a failure, that it had simply resulted in Australians paying more for their motor vehicles, and that the degree of efficiency in the industry had indeed been hampered by his policy and not assisted by it. So I thought that today we might go through some of his debating points one by one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, he said that the figures I had used were out of date and that I had used them selectively. He said that I was wrong in my statements concerning the age of Australian motor vehicles. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That again, appears to be based on a dubious statistical method.</PARA>
<PARA>The source of the figures I used was officers from the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, his own Department. I will quote from the answers given to questions that I asked in the Estimates Committee in April this year. This answer was given by his Department to my questions relating to the age of motor vehicles:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence provided to the Industry Commission Inquiry into the Automotive Industry in 1990 indicated that the passenger motor vehicle replacement cycle is now in excess of 17 years in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>In the additional information supplied, there was no hint that those 1990 figures were in any way challenged by the Department or that there were better figures that ought to have been used. His Department put forward that statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also sought, by implication, to criticise the competency of my staff, something to which I take singular exception. My staffers, of whom there are three full time, work hard. They put in enormous effort, and I appreciate the effort that they put in. They are also exceedingly competent. I would perhaps draw the analogy between me and my staff and Senator Button and his entire Department. The interesting thing is that my staff and his Department agree on the figures I used. It seems that he is the one out of step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the question of competitiveness of the Australian motor industry, I cited figures comparing the Australian industry, in terms of numbers of defects, with those of Japan and the newly industrialising economies. Senator Button might be interested to learn that a report on the industry, published the day after the debate took place last week, put out by the very reputable Centre for Policy Studies, used exactly the same figures as I had chosen to use in the debate. Of course, I had not had the opportunity of seeing the report because it was published the day after that. So much for the figures being out of date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Minister was not satisfied with doing that and he did not cease there. He went on to mislead the debate by claiming that the automation in Australian plants is no different from that in the newly industrialising countries. Next time the Minister might like to tell us the whole truth, reveal it, as did that report by the Centre for Policy Studies, and say that Australian plants have a low level of automation compared with overseas plants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps he would like to use the figures that show that the average productivity of Australian assembly plants in 1989 was 39 hours per vehicle compared with an average of only 16 hours in Japan and 25 hours in North America. Perhaps Senator Button would like to use the words he used back in 1984 when he hailed his car plan and the policy initiative that would provide ordinary Australian families with affordable Australian cars. That simply has not proven to be the case and indeed that is why sales are down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps Senator Button may remember his exchange with Warwick Beutler on the ABC on 29 May 1984. Warwick Beutler said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well what does the consumer get out of this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Minister's car plan&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does he get a cheaper product? Are you guaranteeing this?</PARA>
<PARA>The good Senator and Minister replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, in real terms the consumer will get a cheaper product over the life of this plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Beutler then asked, `When?' and Button replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well I think the effect of increased efficiencies in the industry and longer volume runs and so on will be seen in three or four years. And certainly by 1992 the consumer should be getting a much better deal in real terms from Australian manufactured cars.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister set the standard for 1992. One can play with the figures all one likes, but at the end of the day the Minister fails his own test. The Minister's own Automotive Industry Authority&mdash;that is the one whose life we just extended&mdash;admitted the failure of this simple test in March this year. At page 57 of the report on the state of the automotive industry in 1991, the Authority states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December 1984 the purchase of a typical Australian produced six cylinder automatic sedan priced at approximately $13,000 required 33 weeks full-time gross earnings. In December 1991 a typical large car with a recommended retail price of $24,600 required just over 40 weeks of earnings.</PARA>
<PARA>At the end of the day this is what counts. The Minister has attacked my figures; he has attacked my staff. He set the standard back in 1984 and his own industry authority says he failed. As I said, I would be delighted to debate this matter with the Minister at any time, any place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I might just put an addendum: in the Senate the other day the Minister sent across to me his equivalent of a sealed envelope. He sent me a large, sealed, brown paper envelope. When I opened it, it was full of things which presumably the Minister thought were fit and able for him to throw away. Perhaps he should have checked first. One of the things he sent me was a briefing note. It was a briefing note relating to a Customs matter and particular criticisms relating to the Compile system. I am very pleased to tell the Minister that this particular note has been of great use and interest to me and he can send me a sealed envelope any time he likes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing I would say is this: would the Minister mind checking his facts and, please, when he has got a whole department to do it for him, would he mind getting them a little more accurate?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In September last I was a member of the Australian parliamentary delegation to visit the European parliamentary institutions. It was led by Mr Peter Morris and the deputy leader was Mr Bruce Reid. Also accompanying us were Mr John Langmore, Mr Peter McGauran and Mr Gary Punch. I pay tribute to those members of the delegation for their company and for the stimulating debate we had on that trip.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visit was to the European Parliament, the OECD and the Council of Europe in Strasbourg; the Netherlands Parliament in The Hague; and the European Commission, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, the North Atlantic Assembly and the Belgian Parliament in Brussels. On one weekend the delegation went to Ypres and laid wreaths at the Commonwealth war graves. It was quite a touching occasion as we viewed the thousands upon thousands of crosses on the Australian war graves. I pay tribute to the Office of Australian War Graves for the manner in which those graves are tended. On the Saturday night we were at a ceremony in Ypres itself, which one of the British delegations also attended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On my own initiative I had discussions with the chief executive officer and the chief medical officer of the British National Health Service in London and I investigated the health services in France and the Netherlands. I think it is appropriate that I report today on the visit because on the news this morning we heard that French farmers are demonstrating yet again to preserve the common agricultural policy that is being pursued in Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the information we were given on that trip, I believe it highly unlikely that the US and the European Community will reach agreement on farm subsidies. As honourable senators know, high EC subsidies are paid to European farmers; and that has been the main stumbling block in the six-year-old efforts to reach comprehensive world trade reform under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to be there and see the emotional manner in which the arguments were discussed. One of the points made was that there has been an enormous drift of farmers off the land in France, from nine million down to four million, within the previous five years. The people of France believe that it is cheaper to subsidise production and thereby keep the farmers on the land, both from the aspect of tending the land&mdash;because there is no cheaper way of tending the land than having farmers work it&mdash;and from the aspect of preventing the drift of youth leaving the farms. France has the same problem that we in Australia have&mdash;a drift to the cities. I do not see that there is going to be any change in that attitude, particularly as we are not regarded, in their context, as being of any importance whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The European Parliament is powerless in that it reports back to member countries and does not have legislative power. Hence, the total lack of response to the Yugoslavian conflict. Of course, European unity has been attempted many times in the past. This time the stimulus was the outbreak of two world wars in Europe this century, which in turn led to the Treaty of Rome in 1957. Recently, the second revision of that Treaty, on 7 February this year, was completed in Maastricht in Holland. The Maastricht Treaty was a leap forward in European integration because, unlike the Treaty of Rome, it does not restrict itself to promoting closer relations between individual member states but sets out, instead, a firm schedule of union of these individual states. The Maastricht Treaty embodies three so-called pillars: firstly, European monetary union, which schedules adoption by 1999 of a single European currency and establishment of one central bank; secondly, a common foreign and security policy; and, thirdly, European political union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators know, there was a referendum in France as to whether or not to support the Maastricht Treaty. We were very privileged to be there for the debate before the referendum was held and for the debate that was held thereafter. It is a matter of history now that that referendum was carried by a narrow majority. Earlier this year, on 2 June, a referendum was held in Denmark and it was narrowly rejected. At the time that I was in London there was considerable turmoil within the British Parliament as to what the position of the British Parliament was on this aspect. The Tory Party there is divided on it, although it is supported by the Government, and the Labor Opposition supports the Maastricht Treaty as well. There is discussion about whether a referendum will be held in Britain, but it had not reached the stage of final debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most immediate implication for Australian interests is the risk that the crisis over the Maastricht Treaty may in some way distract the Community from pressing on with getting a successful outcome in the Uruguay Round and proceeding with genuine reform of the common agricultural policy and completing the single market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a lighter note, we visited the Dutch Parliament and, to my complete surprise, I discovered that we had no problems with communication in that all school children in the Netherlands are taught English at school and English is the common parlance. We attended the Netherlands Parliament, in the public gallery, and, again to my complete surprise, when it was announced that the Australian delegation was there&mdash;and I might mention that it is the first delegation to the Netherlands Parliament&mdash;we were applauded by the public gallery. I did not realise the implications of that until I went back to my hotel that night and turned on television, to discover that the top rating television programs in the Netherlands were <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Neighbours</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Country Practice</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Flying Doctors</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Bush Tucker Man</EMPHASIS>. I then understood the relevance of our visit and why our presence was recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also significant in terms of trade&mdash;30 per cent of coal imports to the Netherlands come from Australia. Rotterdam is the largest port in Europe and accommodates 32,000 seagoing vessels every year. Although we continue to run a large deficit, the European Community was Australia's second largest source of imports and the second biggest market for our exports in 1990-91. However, I should warn that economic activity in Europe is sluggish, as it is in the rest of the world. The EC is the biggest source of direct foreign investment in Australia and the second largest investment destination for Australia. The common agricultural policy is the major perennial irritant in our relations with the EC. Import protection, or export subsidisation, costs Australia up to $2 billion annually in lost income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to note that the occupational backgrounds of the majority of parliamentarians, in each of the parliaments that I visited&mdash;I checked this with at least two or three parliamentarians in the European, Belgium and Netherlands parliaments respectively&mdash;were firstly, public servants and, secondly, teachers. I found it interesting that there was only one farmer in the Netherlands Parliament. I was told that there was a committee looking at trying to attract people with other occupational backgrounds into the Parliament, particularly businessmen. I think this explains the tendency for decision making to be done by the bureaucrats, rather than politicians, in the European Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing worth learning about was the principle of subsidiarity. During our one-hour discussion with the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Prime Minister Lubbers, he emphasised the importance of the principle of subsidiarity, which is the basis of the Maastricht Treaty. The principle is that decisions should be made at local, regional or national level as far as possible, rather than by referral to the European Commission. It was felt that this should be the basis of all decision making; the lower the level that it could be achieved at, the better for the community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although our delegation was from three different political parties, I think it is important to note that, even behind the scenes, here in this Parliament, and while we were overseas, we were far and away Australians first. We acted in complete harmony in the interests of our country. I believe much good was obtained by those who went on the visit, both in an educative sense and in a bilateral sense, for the information that we were able to give the various parliaments that we attended. </PARA>

The question remained of whether the loan and subsidy assistance had been applied in accordance with the original agreement, so the Minister referred the matter to the Attorney-General on 16 October 1990. Since then we have been led on a merry chase around this Parliament trying to get some information on what happened to $7 1/2m of taxpayers' money.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not expected that the investigation will be completed until after December 1991. . . But it is hoped that at least one brief will be available by 31 December 1991; that date has been aimed at. I will not go into the details on the public record but, if Senator Macdonald wished, I could indicate what that brief might be about. . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that some other briefs will not be completed until March 1992. If it proves that that timetable is able to be modified in some way, I will let Senator Macdonald know. I will instruct officers to keep him informed as to whether that timetable looks like changing.</PARA>
<PARA>On 5 November 1991 Senator Tate, again in answer to a question on notice, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As far as the ASC's investigation into the Ravenshoe Timber Mill is concerned, it would not be appropriate for me to make any further comment.</PARA>
<PARA>On 6 May this year, Senator Tate told the Senate that briefs had been delivered to the Director of Public Prosecutions. On 8 October, just a few days ago, I gave notice in the Senate of a motion demanding that the Government report progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, the Director of Public Prosecutions advised the ABC radio office in Cairns and also my office that the Ravenshoe investigation was dropped `some time before July'. That is what the Director of Public Prosecutions office told not only the ABC radio in Cairns but also my office yesterday afternoon&mdash;that that investigation into Ravenshoe had been dropped `some time before July'. That was particularly interesting information. I understand that the ABC in Cairns then got onto Mrs Kelly's office to find out what this was all about. It transpired that the DPP issued a press release early yesterday evening saying that it was wrong in what it had told the ABC earlier and that it was referring to another case about Ravenshoe which it had dropped. That is rather strange when yesterday afternoon the Director of Public Prosecutions office told my office that the investigation in Ravenshoe had been dropped some time ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know of there being more than one investigation into the matters at Ravenshoe. It makes me very, very suspicious as to just what is going on. There have now been seven separate occasions when we have been assured by the relevant Government Minister that this Senate would be told what was happening and that it would be kept informed on Commonwealth investigations and attempts to recover that $7m of taxpayers' money which had been misappropriated through this Government's inexcusable mismanagement of the whole affair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important for the Parliament and the people of Australia to say to this Government, `Just what is going on?'. It is over two years since this money was misappropriated. How long do we, as the parliamentarians of this country, have to wait to find out what happened to that money? Who is this Government trying to protect? Is it trying to protect anyone? If it is not, why will it not tell us something about it? Surely the investigation cannot go for two years without there being something tangible that can be reported to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The longer the Government leaves it before making some report to the Parliament on what happened to $7m of taxpayers' money, the more the Parliament and the people of Australia will be entitled to believe that the Government is covering something up. If there is no cover-up, if there is nothing that needs to be hidden, why can it not tell us what is happening? It was, after all, $7.5m of taxpayers' money, sent for a particular purpose, that was misappropriated, yet we cannot find out any answers in spite of all of those questions. I have been through a lot of them but that is only a fraction of what has happened in relation to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a disgrace, it is a scandal and I repeat the demand I made last week: the Minister must tell us just what is happening. Someone seems to be being protected. It is certainly not the people of Ravenshoe and it is certainly not the taxpayers of Australia. Again I plead with the Government. I was in Ravenshoe last weekend, at a festival the people are having up there. They have tried to forget this terrible period in the history of their town. They are getting on with their lives but they are still very anxious to know what happened to that money. Where is the compensation to which they are entitled as a result of the Government's mismanagement of this whole affair? I ask the Minister yet again: what is happening in relation to that investigation? When is he going to come clean to the Parliament of Australia on what has happened to that money and where the investigation is at?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition will not be opposing either the Social Security Amendment Bill 1992 or the Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992. The amendments to the Social Security Act contained in the Social Security Amendment Bill 1992 emanate from the Labor Government's Youth Summit last July. This Bill relaxes the education leaver deferment period in four ways, with a financial impact of $3.5m in 1992-93 and $3.1m in the following financial year. Each of these four initiatives will commence on 2 November 1992, in time for the end of the current school and tertiary year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the calculation of the education leaver deferment period will take into account part time and casual work undertaken following cessation of study. Any reductions in the deferment period will be calculated by converting the number of hours worked to a full time equivalent, based on a working week of 35 hours. The coalition supports this initiative on the grounds that it will encourage young people to seek out casual and part time work at a time when, as we all know in this chamber, there are reduced opportunities for full time work for this age group and also the older long term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, this Bill will mean that Job Search and sickness allowance applicants will become eligible for benefit 13 weeks after leaving school or from 15 February in the subsequent year, whichever is the earlier. Currently the deferment period commences from the date on which a claim is lodged with the Commonwealth Employment Service. The coalition supports this initiative at a time when at least 600,000 Australian children are living in poverty, and we all remember the promise of the previous Prime Minister about that. However, we will review this proposal when we win government to ensure that it does not encourage school leavers to seek Job Search allowance prior to seeking employment or training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, this Bill waives the education leaver deferment period when a person returns to income support within 12 months of leaving it. This will mean that people who have served a deferment period and then undertake a training or education course will not have to serve a second deferment period if they re-claim benefits upon completion of the course. Again, this ostensibly seems to be a sensible initiative, given the absolute dearth of jobs available to young people and the growing importance of education and training in developing worthwhile career opportunities. The coalition does not oppose this initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Social Security Amendment Bill will waive the waiting period for Job Search allowance if the person is eligible for special benefit during the education leaver deferment period. This will allow people to move straight onto Job Search allowance rather than remaining on special benefit during the waiting period. Again, the Government's rationale for this initiative is that it will provide greater incentive to undertake casual and part time work because of the less stringent test under the Job Search allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the coalition does not oppose this initiative and will ensure that it is reviewed after we win government, personally I remain concerned that this initiative will provide a means whereby young people will be able to circumvent the education leaver deferment period. There appears to be no provision in the Bill to ensure that someone whose deferment period has been waived must continue to satisfy the more stringent special benefits eligibility tests during the remainder of the 13-week post-education period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before moving on to the second Bill, it is necessary to point out that none of these initiatives will create one extra job for young people who are currently seeking employment. Youth unemployment remains at over 30 per cent nationally, while in Victoria it is well over 40 per cent. These figures do not include the significant number of young people who would prefer to be working but who have remained in education because there are no work opportunities. When underemployment and disillusioned job seekers are taken into account, it is not at all unreasonable to assert that the actual rate of youth unemployment could be at least double the official figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government remains preoccupied with expensive, public sector based, marginal seat targeted, make-work schemes. In stark contrast, the coalition parties have a comprehensive plan which will provide real jobs, real training and real career opportunities for young Australians. Our minimum youth training wage proposal, announced in July, will create at least 100,000 jobs for young people in the first two years of government. In other words, it will virtually solve the chronic youth unemployment problem in one swoop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minimum youth training wage acknowledges the fact that the abolition of junior rates from awards has priced young people out of the labour market. Anyone who would like confirmation of this fact has only to ask any employer or small business. Mutterings from trade unions that the minimum trade wage will result in slave labour and the replacement of incumbent workers are hypocritical, given that it is the union movement that has single-handedly removed young people from the primary labour market by abolishing junior rates. As in so many other areas, undoubtedly the electorate will be subjected to a Labor scare campaign. The one that was undertaken during the State campaign in the area where my office is situated had to be seen to be believed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister is prattling away there; that is what people were told in their own language. They were scared witless. They were told they would starve to death under the Liberals and that was on letterhead from one of their candidates. It is appalling, absolutely appalling. Why do they have to scare people? I cannot believe it. If the Australian public is hoodwinked into thinking these people are honest and care about people then it has got a lot to learn, because that is the sort of stuff they were engaging in during the campaign. That is why they lost; that is why we had a resounding victory in Victoria. And it did not scare them, there were other things that happened. Mr Halfpenny and his mates were floating around and scaring union people in that area as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has no solutions. There are no plans whatsoever to resurrect Australia. There are no plans to resurrect us from the worst recession in 60 years. The Minister and I grew up in the boom times in Australia and what he has done is let the next generation down. That is what he has done and he ought to be ashamed of it. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been totally cornered by his own failed economic policies. The Prime Minister has quite obviously decided to ignore the pain and suffering that he has inflicted on Australians, on the jobless people in Australia and has sunk to the level of totally negative scare campaigns about Fightback. We have a plan and they have not and the public knows that. We have a plan. Where is their plan? They plan for more of the same&mdash;more unemployment, more youth unemployment, more kids who have no jobs and no future and no hope. That is what their plan is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, it is worth pointing out the major facets of the coalition's minimum youth training wage initiative. These are the basic points. The youth training wage of $3 per hour for 16- and 17-year-olds and $3.50 for 18- to 20-year-olds is a minimum wage. It assumes no qualifications and no prior work experience. It will rise with experience and the acquisition of skills. Youth who have higher qualifications or previous experience will expect to receive a higher starting wage. Anyone who is employed for 20 hours or more on the youth training wage will be given a youth training voucher&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator PATTERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Minister wants to have a say, let him do so and get up and speak, not keep interjecting. The youth training voucher will entitle them to train for up to two days per week, with training in an approved program for one year. This way young people will be able to receive invaluable on the job training as well as access to a wide range of off the job training options, according to their particular needs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second Bill before the Senate is the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992. This Bill provides for a six-monthly lump sum advance payment of family allowance at the first child rate. At the current Government's family allowance rates, this amounts to a six-monthly advance of $135.85. These lump sum payments will commence in January 1993. Having been provided with a copy of the pamphlets and brochures which will be used to promote this initiative, one could be excused for smelling a degree of political bribery in this initiative as well.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, originality has not been one of this Government's strong points and a similar pre-election bribe was to provide the people of Wills just before the by-election&mdash;and it was for all families, but it was focused, I guess, on those families&mdash;with a one-off lump sum family allowance additional payment. But it did not work there. The result was Phil Cleary&mdash;most probably an ex-Labor member, but Phil Cleary. It did not work there and it will not work in the next election either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the current dire economic circumstances the coalition does not oppose this initiative. To do so would be niggardly when so many families are struggling to survive with their primary breadwinners out of work. However, it must be remembered that family allowance was never meant to be a lump sum payment; it was always meant to be a supplement to wages and salaries and wages and salaries are not paid to employees in six-monthly lump sum amounts. Accordingly, the coalition will not support any future extension allowing access to larger lump sum payments of family allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, this opportunity should not pass without pointing out the coalition's financial commitment to the importance of the family unit. This is another thing that the Ministers on the other side forget. Time and time again they get up during Question Time and bag us for one aspect of our tax reform without looking at the other parts of the Fightback package, and this is one of them: the next coalition Government will double the family allowance for low income families with incomes under $30,000 a year. This would mean that, if this Bill were under a coalition government, the maximum six-monthly lump payment would be $271 compared with the $135.85 they would be getting under Labor. Middle income families with incomes between $30,000 and $40,000 in a year would receive a 50 per cent increase in the family allowance, meaning the maximum lump sum payment under a coalition government could be as high as $203. Finally, all families with incomes between $40,000 and $50,000 a year would receive a 6 per cent increase in family allowance, which is more than the estimated percentage increase in prices resulting from the goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that the coalition supports both of these relatively minor social security Bills. However, as the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, so eloquently pointed out last night in the Alfred Deakin lecture, the coalition remains very concerned that the current Australian Labor Party Government seems content with servicing this country's chronic problems rather than taking the measures that are needed if we are actually going to solve the problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief. The Australian Democrats support both the Social Security Amendment Bill and the Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2), but I cannot let this opportunity pass without reminding the Senate that the Democrats have been trying for quite some time&mdash;for over 12 months&mdash;to reduce not only the education leavers waiting period but all waiting periods. We attempted to reduce the education leavers waiting period for both the Job Search allowance and the sickness allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have repeatedly called upon the Government to end all waiting periods. While we acknowledge that it has at last moved in this direction, we remind the Government that considerable hardship and suffering have resulted from the delay. If the Government had supported the Democrats' very similar amendments last year, we would not have had so many young people having such considerable difficulty in making ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, it has been as a result of the pressure from welfare agencies and other groups that the Government has finally acted. It has finally seen the damage that has been caused and the suffering that has resulted from its policies and its tightening of the social security system&mdash;or, as we have called it before, the antisocial insecurity system that we now have. So we certainly welcome the move now, but we remind the coalition parties that they supported these waiting periods in the first place. On the two occasions on which the Democrats moved amendments trying to reduce or remove them, we were opposed by the Government and the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind Senator Patterson that the pain and suffering that she talks about and the problems that we now face in this country were brought about because of the continued support for Government economic policies by the Opposition. So, if we are looking at sheeting home blame to anybody, there is no way that the Opposition can back out and suggest that it has absolutely nothing to do with anything. It is the Opposition that has worked with the Government to reduce tariffs and to deregulate this country. For the Opposition to come in here and suggest that somehow its hands are clean and that it has solutions is something that I cannot let go without some comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in commenting on what Senator Patterson said about the youth wage, I remind her that there are no youth prices in supermarkets; there are no youth prices when we are looking at buying clothes and other necessities; there is no youth rate for the basic transport needs or any sort of entertainment; and there are certainly no youth rents. When I look at some of the proposals of the Liberal Party of Australia, I wish that they would go into more detail of some of the ramifications of those policies particularly for young people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank both the coalition and the Australian Democrats for supporting the Social Security Amendment Bill and the Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Patterson, like many other coalition members, comes into the chamber and espouses the virtues of Fightback, but the Opposition is very sensitive to criticism of Fightback. Senator Patterson, very sensibly, moved her electorate office down to Clayton because if one moves into marginal territory one is much more likely to be preselected. That is why my electorate office is in Nunawading. It used to be very marginal. I regret that it is not so marginal these days. Apparently she takes some exception to the fact that the Australian Labor Party won that seat with a substantial majority. I hope she does not draw from that the conclusion that it reflects badly on Senator Patterson having her electorate office there. What it reflects well on is the intelligence of the electors of Clayton and the quality of the candidate that we ran. So she should not feel too sensitive about the fact that the Liberals did not win that seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really think it is a bit of cheek to say that we ran a scare campaign in Victoria. The Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>, one of the most sleazy newspapers ever produced in the world, ran a campaign against the Labor Party for a year. So it is a bit hot for someone in the Opposition to complain about campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the more substantive issues, I found it very interesting that, when Fightback was first received in the conservative party room, only three people knew the details of it and yet everyone in the room stood on the chairs and cheered it, without having seen it. Senator Patterson reflected on that today. In fact, she was reflecting on an absolute need to believe in something, no matter what the content of it. Members of the Opposition are extremely sensitive when the content of that document is put under the microscope as they do not want to be disillusioned. They do not want to have their beliefs shattered as they have to believe in something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has gone to four elections and it has been defeated, having had weak leadership and no ideas at all. Members of the Opposition are now embracing a set of right wing ideological ideas and they want to believe in them for the sake of believing and no more than that. Nothing could espouse that attitude more than the Opposition's naive suggestion that as soon as the skills of people on the $3 an hour wage level are enhanced that wage will go up. We all know from experience that the moment the skills of those people are slightly enhanced, and the cost of labour goes up, they will be shed and another lot will be brought in at $3 an hour. It has been happening in fast food chains and one or two emporiums for a number of decades now and it will continue into the future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Australia Bank survey has been drawn to my attention. The great bulk of available evidence is that the economy is recovering. Honourable senators opposite select the most pessimistic thing they can find, of course, because they have a vested interest in that. The Dun and Bradstreet survey for the December quarter was also published today. Let me spell out the pattern which it shows. The net figure for businesses as an expected increase in their sales was constant at 17 for the first two quarters of 1992. It improved to 25 for the third quarter and has surged to 35 for the fourth quarter. That shows a clear improvement in business short term expectations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Australia Bank survey also shows an improvement in the September quarter and expectations of an improvement in the December quarter. The National Australia Bank survey outlook for the next 12 months deteriorated marginally but firms still expect an improvement in business conditions. That is a correct reading, I believe, of the survey. The survey's negative picture for employment is not supported by the facts or by other indicators for the labour market. The NAB survey shows a negative net balance for employment growth in the September quarter, but the facts do not support that conclusion because the ABS figures show that employment grew in that quarter. This suggests that the NAB survey is overly pessimistic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are all sorts of comments from various sectors. The NAB survey is an important one, just as the others to which I have referred are important. One source of the pessimism may be the bias of the NAB survey in that it ignores small business. It covers businesses with 50 or more employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bureau of Industry Economics has published work showing that employment in the small business sector was much more resilient through the recession than employment in larger firms. That is because of business conditions generally but also because of the substantial restructuring of the operation of major firms which has been taking place in the past few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent data from the BIE shows small business employment growing faster than large business employment. Other leading indicators of employment are more positive than the NAB survey. The Australian Bureau of Statistics vacancies figures rose in the September quarter; private sector job vacancies rose 24 per cent in the year to September; and the ANZ job vacancies and the DEET skilled vacancies are also showing slight improvements in trend terms. All I am seeking to do is to put the NAB survey in the context of a number of other important surveys which happen to have been published at the same time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a good news question for all Australians. The good news is that the back of waterfront reform in this country is now broken, and significant new efficiencies exist on the Australian waterfront. That is good news for anyone exporting or importing. It is the end of this phase of a significant round of micro-economic reform, and it has been reform achieved in the Labor way. The reform has been  achieved without disputation, harmoniously, without any industrial relations big bangs and without, as Dr Hewson said at the Press Club, `putting troops onto the waterfront' in order to bring about the reforms. This was done by consensus and the achievement is substantial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will outline the detail of that achievement. Productivity on the Australian waterfront has now doubled. The work force on the Australian waterfront has been reduced by 56 per cent&mdash;more than halved. Industrial disputation on the waterfront is at absolute minimal levels. The container terminal performance is comparable with that of our major trading partners. In bulk grains, the Australian Wheat Board is achieving massive savings and massive labour reductions in the movement of the wheat crop. It is, by any test, a significant outcome and one that should be applauded by all Australians for the benefit it brings to the economy through this significant micro-economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now put in place a competitive framework for stevedoring companies. There is now no longer the pool system of employment. People have to hire from the central labour pool. Labour is dedicated and employed directly by each company. There are now something like 70 enterprise agreements on the waterfront, providing enterprise agreements for those companies and those ports, ensuring competitiveness between stevedoring companies and thus a normal or more typical market and, therefore, using the engine of competitiveness, continuing an ongoing reform on the waterfront without the Government having to be there as a stimulator or as the catalyst for that reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have reinvented the Australian waterfront so we now have an efficient, modern, up-to-date and world level waterfront. To put it in pictorial terms, it is like the `before' and `after' ad one sees in weight loss clinics. Before the waterfront: fat, pudgy and unhealthy; now: slim, taut and terrific. That is the Australian waterfront. The old allegation, `Blame it on the waterfront for shipping delays', now no longer applies.</PARA>

It would be a slight on this country and our international position if anyone tried to decry these achievements.

The Government's future role will be the subject of a report to me at the end of this month by the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority. But it is clear now that since the back of reform has been broken the high profile role of the Government can be diminished. We can look forward to the time when we can consider the abolition of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority so that there is not an ongoing government authority. It has come into existence, has spent three years doing a job and achieving the result, and we can now consider taking it out of existence. The reason we can do that is that we have restructured the waterfront so that the competitive and competition ethic applies. Competition between companies with their own labour and not drawing from a pool will be such as to ensure ongoing parity with the world's best.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significant point about this that I want to make&mdash;and it is a significant point, given the findings of the Prices Surveillance Authority&mdash;is about the gains achieved at the port not reaching the pockets of the users because some shipping companies have pocketed those gains and not passed them on. One of the reasons everyone should know the extent of these reforms is that, if they do negotiate their contracts with the shipping companies, they should ensure that they get in their new contracts the full measure of price reductions  that have been achieved on the waterfront. Already price reductions of between 20 and 25 per cent are common on renewed contracts. But there is more there, according to Professor Fels, and those negotiating commercially should see that they get the full measure.</PARA>

Senator Parer would also see that I said that Professor Fels's inquiry had found that not all of the real cost reductions had been passed on. But let us not diminish what has been achieved; a 20 to 25 per cent cost reduction is significant in anyone's language. Prices tend to go up, not down, and if we can get a 25 per cent cut, that is good. But what we are saying is that there is more there or, at least, Professor Fels is saying that there is more there&mdash;not that nothing has been done, but that there is more there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I have just finished saying&mdash;and what Senator Parer may not have been listening to because he may have been concentrating on how to try to ask his question&mdash;is that it is now a commercial issue. We should proclaim what the achievements and efficiencies are, so that people who are using the waterfront can negotiate commercial contracts to ensure that the full measure of gain is passed on to them; so there is a community of interest among waterside workers, stevedoring companies and the users to see that the links in the middle of the chain perform to pass the real gains through. That is what I have said, and that is an important operation of the market&mdash;which is something that Senator Parer may pretend to know about but on this occasion appears not to know anything about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then Senator Parer had a snide and I might say somewhat sneaky dig, unfairly, about what has been the cost. Of course there has been a cost. But I ask Senator Parer to put against the cost the cost of the alternative model espoused by his esteemed leader, Dr John Hewson. What did he say at the National Press Club? Let me remind honourable senators what he said: he would achieve waterfront reform by, if necessary, putting troops into the Australian waterfront to do the work of waterside workers. That is what he said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us for a minute talk about cost. These significant gains have been achieved harmoniously and without any real dispute, and they have left a legacy of a committed work force determined to do better, working in cooperation with the companies. If those opposite want to put the troops in and take jobs away from people who are standing on some principle because they resist force, the cost will be massive industrial disruption, a work force that is demoralised and uncommitted to making world best practice gains and a huge cost to the users of the waterfront if, indeed, they can have access to the waterfront.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 30 December last year, 3 January this year and 10 May this year and, in sequence, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> and on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program, Mr Howard indicated that there would be a flat minimum wage which, in some cases, would be below the award level and above the level of the dole. We now have an inspired leak from the Opposition, which is releasing its industrial relations policy next Tuesday, that it has backtracked. Either Mr Howard has been done over in the party room by Dr Hewson or the Opposition has backtracked because of the electoral sensitivities of its hardline policy. If it is the fact that it has backtracked, it has said, `It is not six now; it is half a dozen of the other that we are proposing to do'. This is a change in presentation rather than a change in fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shane Green said in this article that the Opposition intends to announce that the new base rate for workers will be minimum rates in existing awards. The polling that has been undertaken about industrial relations shows that Australians know what an award is, like an award and do not want to lose access to an award, hence the change in language from the Opposition in an effort to pretend that it will stand by the award system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if the Opposition follows the Victorian model&mdash;and Mr Howard has said that it will&mdash;it will tip everyone out of the arbitration system so that people cannot have access to the Commission, unless by mutual agreement. Therefore, they would be frozen out and could not vary their award. The award then becomes fixed and degrades over time with levels of inflation and the imposition of other costs.</PARA>

The Rosebery centre will house one of the most advanced switching systems in the world. It will control the whole of Optus's national, international and cellular networks. Rosebery will be the centre for its operational support system which, alone, will have at least $250m spent on developing software over the next three years. The bulk of this money will be for work done by Australians.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that in terms of trade friction between the United States and Japan, a lot of that does relate to agricultural commodities. If Australia tried to use the strength of its relationship with Japan to negotiate with the United States on some of these issues, the response to Japan would be that the United States seeks much greater access to the Japanese rice market, and that would become the burden of the debate. It is a real issue on both sides&mdash;namely, access to the Japanese rice markets, access of unsubsidised wheat to the world wheat markets.

As Aged Care Australia is the peak body representing aged persons hostels around the country, is this not a gross indictment of the Government's policies over the past 10 years?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The charges quoted by Senator Archer apply to both quarantine charges for imports and export of plant and plant products, which includes non-prescribed grain, but not prescribed grain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prescribed grains are those defined in the Grain, Plants and Plant Products Orders, these are: wheat, oats, barley, sorghum, dried field peas and lupins. Other grains are defined as non prescribed.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The half hourly charge of $86 includes the cost of travel to clients and on the export side also includes the issuance of the first phytosanitary certificate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AQIS charges not only recover the cost of State employed inspectors, but also State support costs and AQIS regional and Canberra office costs. These costs not only include administrative overheads but costs associated with related functions such as pest risk assessment and continuing protocol development for the various imported commodities on the import side and protocol development for continued access to overseas markets on the export side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1 August 1992 AQIS introduced a daily rate of $745. The equivalent fee for service which was applicable before the introduction of the daily charge would be $1,204. The introduction of the daily rate allows clients, who can increase the consignments being inspected at one time, thereby reducing the travelling time of inspectors, to benefit from reduced inspection costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figure quoted by Senator Archer of $55.88 per hour was raised in an article in the Daily Commercial News on 8 October 1992 by the Australian Chamber of Shipping (ACOS). This figure was based on the assumption that AQIS staff/expenditure ratio was 1.92. ACOS's interpretation of the AQIS staff/expenditure was incorrect and the methodology in arriving at the $55.88 hourly charge was flawed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ACOS's interpretation of the DPIE `Program Performance Statements 1992-93' was incorrect in developing the multiplier. The salary figure used by ACOS only related to staff employed directly by the Commonwealth which are predominantly meat inspection staff. The cost of employing State Department inspectors on an agency basis for quarantine and some export inspection services are reported as administrative expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly the staffing figure reported does not include the State staff employed on an agency basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In arriving at the $55.88 hourly charge, ACOS assumed that all AQIS staff, including technical and support staff recovered charges for every hour they are employed, when in fact only inspection staff charge for their services and then only charge for actual inspection time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the matter of the costs of inspection in New Zealand, these are currently $NZ66.60 per hour or part thereof for the first hour and $16.65 quarter hour thereafter plus $NZ0.62 per kilometre travelled plus a certification charge of $NZ14.40 per certificate. Note the hourly/quarter hourly charge is also applied to return travel in addition to the kilometre charge. AQIS charges $86 for the first half hour, then $43 per quarter hour thereafter for inspection time only, regardless of distance travelled which can be much more significant in Australia than New Zealand. The first certificate is provided free in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of inspections are undertaken within the first half hour charge and therefore for comparison purposes there is some legitimacy in comparing the Australian minimum half hour charge ($A86), which is all inclusive, to the New Zealand minimum hour charge plus travel time plus the kilometre charge plus the certificate charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The example for a half hour inspection job which requires the inspector to travel 30 kms (1/2 hours travel) to the job ie 60 kms and one hours return travel, the comparative costs would be in Australia $A86 and in New Zealand $NZ151.50.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also understood that New Zealand fees do not, in fact, collect the full cost of the inspection service programs to the extent that Australian cost recovery policy requires. The New Zealand charges only recover the direct costs of inspection services and not all the overheads that go into providing the total service. The structure of the New Zealand Department makes a distinction between the policy development group and the service delivery group such that a number of policy development, technical support and other infrastructure costs are not included in the inspection cost base.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now provide the following information in answer to that question.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Drugs of Dependence (Amendment) Act 1992 of the ACT entered into force on 18 September 1992. That Act provides a procedure under which a police officer may in certain circumstances serve an offence notice on a person as an alternative to the prosecution of the person for a `simple cannabis offence' as defined. The offence notice calls for payment of a prescribed penalty for such an offence, being an amount of $100.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By virtue of the Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915 s.4A, that change in the law in the ACT has changed the law in Jervis Bay Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, provision exists in the Acceptance Act for a law in force in Jervis Bay Territory by virtue of s.4A to be amended or repealed by an Ordinance that might be made by the Governor-General in Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is therefore open to the Government to seek the making of an Ordinance that will, in a particular respect, break the nexus between the law in the ACT and the law applying in Jervis Bay Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It can be expected that the Government would do so where it considered that a law of the ACT was undesirable or inappropriate, such as if it attempted to legalise the possession or use of marijuana.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is satisfied that the new provision, being very similar to a provision that has been in force for several years in South Australia, is not inconsistent with Australia's obligations under the various United Nations Drugs Conventions. I draw particular attention to that part of the ACT Amendment which makes it clear that the Amendment does not change the character of a `simple cannabis offence' as an offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a policy consideration, I point out that the Amendment merely provides a procedure that may be used as an alternative to the ordinary prosecution of an offence in the courts. It is therefore a matter of law enforcement policy and prosecuting discretion whether prosecuting authorities use the new procedure rather than institute a prosecution, just as it is a matter for decision by those authorities whether to take any action at all in a particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The South Australian procedure is compatible with the strategy endorsed by the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy to this point.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy is currently developing a new national strategy on drugs which is to be considered by the Council in April next year. The Government will await the completion of the new strategy before reviewing Commonwealth policy. Accordingly, the Government has made no decision to vary the application of ACT law as affected by the 1992 Drugs Amendment.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator McKiernan on 15 October 1992 relating to waterfront reform.</PARA>
<PARA>It is important that the boasts of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) in relation to the Government's record of waterfront reform be put into context. We are looking at a government that has been in office approximately 10 years but which only now is claiming some achievements out of this critical area of structural reform. At best, it has to be said that the process of reform in this area has been pitifully slow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point that needs to be looked at is at what cost. The cost has been some $430m, which is what has been paid to encourage wharf labourers to retire. Half that amount was paid by the Australian taxpayers; over $200m of taxpayers' money has gone in as an incentive to these people. The other half was paid for by the users of these services, therefore adding to the cost of the use of these services and, in turn, resulting in less competitive rates. When we look at Senator Cook's claim of achievement, we have to take into account that $430m of taxpayers' and users' money has been expended to buy the reforms that he is claiming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point that needs to be made is that, contrary to what the Minister said about reductions in costs, it seems that there is considerable evidence to suggest that costs to users have not significantly reduced at all. As my colleague Senator Parer said in his question, that is the critical issue. The whole process is designed to enable Australia to be more competitive, and that is obviously to be measured in terms of costs. As I said, there is evidence to suggest that costs have not come down at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the chamber of what Mr Bernie Derikis, the principal consultant to CRA and a member of the Australian Ship Users Group, said a little earlier this year when he was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the import-export point of view, it&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"It's no cheaper today to export a tonne of metal or onions than it was three years ago. The benefits will take some time to drift through and I'm not confident they ever will. It's very disappointing given the time and money spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The beneficiaries of the reform have been the waterside and stevedoring industries. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course that is right, because they have not had to pay for these reforms. As I said, they are being paid for by the taxpayer and the users. These industries simply get the benefits. I am not surprised that the Minister gets up and says that they are supportive of the reforms that he has undertaken. I will continue the quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . but it hasn't helped our export competitiveness in overseas markets.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the critical point. If the Minister could come in here today and point to industries that are now more competitive in their exporting as a result of his reforms, he would be making out a better case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point we have to consider is that we are not in competition with ourselves. The question now is whether our wharves are more competitive as opposed to the wharves of those with whom we compete. It is true that the rate of turnover of containers per hour has improved under this Government's slow process of reform from 12 to 18. But compare that figure with those of ports in other countries: Yokohama, 29; Everglades, 28; Charleston, 30; Philadelphia, 31; Houston, 27; and New Orleans, 29. The bottom line of that is that we are not doing well enough. Compared with those with whom we are competing, we are not competitive. When this Minister can come in and demonstrate that our wharves are more competitive with the wharves of others, he will better make his case. </PARA>

When I answered the question that was put to me by Senator McKiernan, I said that this is an occasion for joy and celebration for all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People said that waterfront reform could not be achieved in this country. At the National Press Club, John Hewson said that reform was so difficult that he would be prepared to put the troops on the Australian waterfront and risk what would amount to an industrial civil war in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reform that has been achieved has been achieved harmoniously. The Waterside Workers Federation and the Foremen Stevedores Association have worked very closely and cooperatively with the stevedoring companies and with the shipping users, who have just been referred to, and with the Government to bring about the reform. What are the statistics? A work force has been reduced by 56 per cent voluntarily. The workers have mostly gone by redundancy. We now have a work force less than half of what applied previously putting out more production and achieving a doubling of waterfront production. Is that an outcome that we should condemn? Is that an outcome that we should deride? Of course it is an outcome that is a significant achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I named employers and union people who had worked to achieve this result, I meant for the Senate to recognise that we as Australians ought to pay them due thanks for achieving that. Australian ports are now competitive in the world. A representative of an Australian shipping company said to me, `In the past you could be absolutely sure when your ship would get to Australia, but you could never be sure when it would leave'. Now one can be sure of both. The ports are efficient, the ship turnaround time is much reduced, and the ability to load containers more rapidly is vastly increased. The productivity of the individual worker, because workers are more skilled, have wider training and operate more complicated and sophisticated equipment, is vastly improved as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industrial disputes, the old bete noire of the waterfront in Australia, are at an all time record low. Because the structure of the labour force has now been changed, no longer is it a pool system from which individual employers hire labour when they need it. That has been dissolved. The system that now applies is that waterside workers are employed directly by the companies and there is a competition ethic applying here so the companies compete with each other for the services of would-be contractors. Thus, the competition ensures continuing greater efficiency. They are reasons for Australian pride. They are reasons to say, `We in this country can do things for ourselves and achieve good results'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just heard someone say that if I could point to more examples, I would be more convincing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak to the response given by Senator Cook in Question Time to both the question asked by Senator McKiernan and the question asked by myself. When Senator Cook answered the question, he repeated it. He used phrases such as `joy and celebration for all Australians', `the reinvented waterfront', `productivity doubled' and `trim, taut and terrific'. They were the comments made by Senator Cook. They have all the hallmarks of the comments made by his own boss, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when he has referred to this economy over the past few years. Do honourable senators remember the terms he used to use, such as `beautiful numbers'? The country was going out backwards and he was talking about beautiful numbers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a Budget not so long ago the Prime Minister said, `This Budget will bring home the bacon'. He brought home the bacon all right&mdash;and very rancid sort of stuff it was. He talked about the recession we had to have, and then said, `The recession has been over for a long time'. One million people are out of work and he is talking about the recession being over. Then, lo and behold, only a week or two ago he actually said that he had saved Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are getting the same language from Senator Cook. Senator Cook is quite incorrect when he said that we agree there has been some improvement. We are complaining that $430m or thereabouts of taxpayers' money or users' money has been used over the past couple of years to make the waterfront more efficient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because we have a foreign debt that is approaching $155 billion, we desperately need to have one of the most efficient waterfronts in the world. It is no good increasing efficiency by 20 or 15 per cent when the rest of the world is increasing efficiency by 80 or 100 per cent. We are concerned that in fact we are going backwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to me, Senator Cook said that he thought container efficiency had gone up by about 20 or 25 per cent. For the money outlaid, that is a pretty lousy return, particularly when the people who received redundancy pay outs had not worked anyway. In fact, it is probably more correct to say that money was paid to retire people and get them off the payroll. It just shows how the system had been featherbedded over a long period for no other reason than sheer militancy and Mafia-style standover tactics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the real situation? Let me outline our concern&mdash;and this is the basis of my question: the real reason for improving waterfront efficiency is to make it cheaper for the users of the waterfront, whether they be importers or exporters. One can go through all the machinations in the world, spend the $400m and double the output, but if the user pays the same amount of money or more than he or she did before, the money will be wasted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some months ago I said to Senator Cook, `Give us an idea just how the costs have changed to the user compared with New Zealand'. He should have known the answer but he did not give it to me. The latest figures that I had when I asked him the question show that in New Zealand&mdash;which now has a reputation, regrettably, as a place more desirable to make investments than Australia&mdash;the cost of moving a 20 foot equivalent unit container has been reduced from $298 to $166;  in Australia, it has dropped from $282 to $278, or $4 per container. What an absolute disgrace! Why have we wasted this taxpayers' money to achieve that sort of efficiency increase?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to support the proposition put by Senator Hill and Senator Parer that the bottom line of waterfront reform must be lower costs to consumers. Members of Importers Against Port Services and Charges said recently in evidence to the Prices Surveillance Authority that they were losing more than $60m annually through unjustified extra charges by shipping companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch on another matter which I think really puts this whole matter into perspective. I refer to the case of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jill Coast</EMPHASIS> in Western Australia last May. I raised this matter in the Senate at that time. I will summarise the situation. Two stevedoring companies quoted $30 a tonne and $36 a tonne plus their additional charges, which amounted to about 50 per cent of both those figures. Ocean Bridge Shipping Pty Ltd, the owners of the vessel called the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jill Coast</EMPHASIS>, believed, on the basis of those quotes, that it would be too costly to ship the 700 tonnes of potatoes it wanted to ship to Mauritius. So the company asked for independent quotes from contractors who were prepared to load potatoes. The company received a quote for $7.50 a tonne&mdash;a quarter of the cost. That would have been real waterfront reform. If the company had been allowed to accept that quote, the cost of loading the potatoes would have been reduced to less than 20 per cent of the original quotes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister comes in here and talks about the waterfront reform process, which has cost us well over $400m. I note that an additional claim of $20m has been made through the Advance to the Minister for Finance. We will be talking about that later on today. Although we will have spent $420m, there have been very marginal drops in the prices of handling goods and services across our wharves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the very short time which I have, I particularly want to make reference to the situation with wheat marketing. The drop in the price of moving wheat across our wharves has little or nothing to do with the waterfront reform process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The waterfront reform process is about those people operating in the stevedoring companies and the excess work force they have, and the $420m has been about making people redundant and taking them out of the work force. In fact, the process in wheat was going on long before the $420m was even thought of, let alone implemented. It is quite inaccurate for the Minister to claim that lower grain freight costs are a result of the waterfront reform process. It was going on, it would have kept going on and it would have happened regardless of that. The principal reason for that was technology&mdash;self-unloading ships and self-loading ships which do not require the people that were involved in this waterfront reform process. I find it very disturbing that that is used as one of the claims. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>I know from my own work with the Anglican Social Responsibilities Commission in Western Australia how easy it is for political leaders to try to discount and marginalise those who hold opposite views from those of the major parties. So this attempt at discrediting by the Opposition is not a surprise. There have been critiques, not just in the political arena but also in the media, that actually debate whether the bishops' statement represents the views of the Left or of the Right. I cite two very interesting articles, one for each position. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on Sunday 4 October, 1992 David Kemp, under the heading, `Pope's words apt for Australian economy', analyses one of the Pope's encyclicals of May last year as being very supportive of capitalism. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Catholic Reporter</EMPHASIS> of 18 September 1992 there is a very astute and detailed response by Richard McBrien to the sentiments in the encyclical under the heading, `Capitalists should worry about Pope'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Right/Left debate is an illustration of why I phrased the matter of public importance in the way I did. This statement puts all political parties on notice that we need to address those pressing social concerns in our economic planning. This critique transcends the Right/Left analysis. It addresses a concern that a friend expressed to me recently: that Australia is aching for government to show that it has a heart. A government with a heart has been missing for many years. The Australian community has at last found a voice of challenge through this statement from the Commission regarding the need for those hearts' cries to be heard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far from disparaging the Bishops and their inquiry, I believe that this country owes them a debt of gratitude. They have been able to do what no government has dared to tackle. They have set out to investigate the way wealth operates in our society, how it follows certain patterns, how it is held and how it is denied to the most vulnerable people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that people should remember when this inquiry began. It was not something thought up on the spur of the moment over a Sunday lunch. The inquiry grew out of a deep concern for the well-being of ordinary Australians during that time when greed was good&mdash;the decade of the 1980s. The inquiry began to receive submissions in the aftermath of the October 1987 stock market crash. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to acknowledge here other similar endeavours. I draw attention to a book about the situation in New Zealand entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hearts and Minds: A Place for People in a Market Economy,</EMPHASIS> by Richard Randerson, published in 1992. The Right Reverend Penny Jamieson, the Bishop of Dunedin, says that Richard Randerson, in his book, gives us some idea of how to go about building the fence that we need to build at the top of the cliff, rather than at the bottom of the cliff, for people who are suffering through harsh and uncaring economic policies: `It is a question of priorities', he says; `Put the people first, and do the economics to fit, and it is all quite possible. There is an alternative'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the inquiry that led to the statement under discussion today began in 1987. The inquiry in New Zealand that I have referred to commenced in mid-1988 as a result of the work of the Anglican Social Responsibilities Commission. The book contains materials from seminars that were run in 1991 for more than 1,200 people all around New Zealand on how local communities could contribute to building an economy with a more human face. The title of the book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hearts and Minds</EMPHASIS>, is a phrase used by the New Zealand Minister of Finance when she introduced her 1991 Budget. The Minister said that the Government was engaged in a battle for the `hearts and minds' of New Zealanders. Mr Randerson felt that her words were prophetic, for that is precisely the nature of what is going on. And I think this applies to Australia as well:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is indeed a battle as to whether New Zealand can retain the reality of community in the face of continuing policies which seek to emphasise the individual. Will there be a warm heart of community, or only the coldness of individuals out to pursue their own interest, with diminished regard for the circumstances of those around them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is encouraging to see the church enter into this debate. The church's right to voice these concerns has been well covered in the debate in the other place. Later speakers may also address this. The bishops did not set out to use the wealthy in the community as a whipping post. Rather, their concern was that, while enormous personal fortunes had been created during recent years, particularly in the 1980s&mdash;the greed is good decade&mdash;enormous pockets of abject poverty and misery had been created. Cardinal Clancy, in his foreword to the book, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . many people have recognised the timeliness of the project and see its relevance to the day-to-day lives of the inhabitants of this country. They consider that the churches are well placed to comment on socio-economic developments, and in particular to call for the insertion of moral values into the debate. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that Cardinal Clancy is absolutely right. The climate of economic rationalism, so-called, needs to be changed in this country. The wealth inquiry sets out some steps for a new agenda in the public debate on what makes a country rich. No doubt at some point in discussion about <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Common Wealth for the Common Good</EMPHASIS> someone from the Opposition parties will want to use that favourite ritualistic phrase so much loved of those who hold the power and the wealth in our society, `You have to create wealth before it can be shared around'. There may even be some rationalisation to support such a notion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to ask a question of those who would use such rhetoric. The question is this: why is it that, while personal fortunes were being made during the 1980s and while company profits in all sectors were at record levels, the number of people in poverty in Australia grew enormously and the gap between the wealthy and the poor doubled? The trickle down theory is correct in only one part. Of the wealth that is held by those at the top, there is barely a trickle for those at the bottom. I quote from the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hearts and Minds</EMPHASIS>, which supports the comments made in this statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This theory is what is known as the trickle down approach and is quite inadequate. Unless human needs are specifically identified and put in place as the goals to which all economic policy must be directed, there is no guarantee at all that people will be central to policy making. People must be the measure of any policy. If tens of thousands are to be made unemployed as a result of economic restructuring, then more thought needs to be given as to the way in which restructuring is carried out and to how the unemployed will be provided for and creatively deployed in the mean time.</PARA>
<PARA>This task of looking critically and trying to restructure in a way that respects the dignity of human people is the basis and very important starting point of the statement we are talking about today. Before major political parties start attacking those who call for a different approach to social and economic issues in Australia, labelling them as `leftist ideologues', they need to carefully consider their own world systems, world views and fundamental, not to say fundamentalist, belief systems. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have one major party in government, the one which gave us deregulation gone mad and a recession we had to have, causing misery for hundreds of thousands of Australians. On the other side we have a group which wants to ignore people in its mad pursuit of pure market economics. It is time that they were reminded that it is not markets which buy goods and services, it is people, families&mdash;the very ones whose case the Catholic bishops are presenting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For both major parties the message is clear: misery is not defined by statistics and wealth is not the measure of our society's well-being. It matters not whether people lose their job because of some ideologically pure adjustment to tariffs or because of some twisted thinking about regulation and deregulation. What matters is whether people are able to live in dignity and are able to make that most valuable contribution of all to our society&mdash;their happiness and readiness to participate in the daily decision making processes which determine the shape of our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This statement presents a diagnosis of our society and its message is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Gospel-based values widely accepted by those who work from a Christian perspective to attain a just society include a recognition of the essential dignity of all persons, the need to work for the common good, and our duty to stand alongside poor people and to try to ensure that they are treated justly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That ours is not a just society is apparent from the great and increasing inequality of wealth and income in Australia, the presence of serious poverty, unemployment and homelessness, and the growth of what is commonly called an `underclass' of gravely disadvantaged people.</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to make a statement around which our matter of public importance is phrased. Consequently, Australians need to change. We need to change those attitudes and structures which help to create and maintain serious imbalances in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer to a summary of the document, in chapter 6, which looks at the detail into which this statement has gone to analyse and critique the imbalances in wealth distribution. It looks at some of the causes and it presents a very clear setting out of areas that need to be addressed. There are recommendations in this statement towards the financial system of our country. There is a particular recommendation that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commonwealth Government monitor the effects of deregulation more carefully, especially in the areas of banking, speculative investment and overseas borrowing.</PARA>
<PARA>The areas of employment, housing and social security also have recommendations and an analysis. Other items that are covered are: taxation, health, education, the pressure on families, Aboriginal people and many other signs of imbalance. Time is too short, unfortunately, to draw out the worth in this document, and I urge honourable senators to take the time to study it either in full or through the summary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry does not subscribe to the conventional notion that governments should of necessity be constantly lowering taxes. The bishops obviously recognise that the services, the structures and the furthering of many of our society's goals require money in the hand of government. Otherwise, as the bishops point out, we will have no means of redressing the imbalances which are evident in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth while to reiterate a comment made by Senator Coulter in his debate on Monday, that economic statistics such as GDP indicate a level of economic activity but that it is a mistake to use these as measures of social welfare or well-being of a society. There is a real contradiction, for example, in including the cost of repairing environmental damage from an oil spill as an increase in economic well-being. The same is true of counting spending on the treatment of industrial health problems. This particular point is referred to in the preface of this statement in a very apt way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea of common wealth is being discussed:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its widest sense the idea of a common wealth refers to a society founded on its shared wealth where wealth is broadly understood. It includes notions of our common possessions or heritage and the general welfare and well-being of the whole population. This rich concept has unfortunately been devalued in more recent usage, being identified with purely monetary wealth and even the gross domestic product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea of common wealth in its broadest and egalitarian sense is reclaimed in this statement, which avoids a double reduction of the humanity which common wealth represents to the purely economic and of the economic to the monetary. Increasingly in Australian culture the measure of worth and well-being has been reduced to an economic calculation and then to a bank balance with a consequent impoverishment for everybody.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, the bishops do not hold back from the necessity of looking at garnering the resources in government to address the problems in our society. They do not resile from recommending a wealth tax, nor from calling for adequate income for those for whom there are no jobs, in all age groups, nor for recommending that legislation be enacted which will protect workers from exploitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Catholic bishops have done this country a great service. They have drawn our attention to issues in a manner consistent with their duty of care to the whole community and not just the rich and powerful&mdash;the policy makers. Furthermore, they have done so in a way which is not aligned to the policies and practices of any of our political parties. And, if we care to listen, they have given us all in this chamber a message about our duties as legislators. That message is that Australia's well-being is not to be measured by economic growth percentages, nor by its inflation rate, but rather by the decency in which people are able to live their lives and the compassion and care which is addressed responsibly by government. </PARA>

It is very refreshing to have the opportunity to address the philosophies behind the problem of the economy or the structure of society. I also welcome very much&mdash;probably more so than some others&mdash;this statement by the Catholic bishops of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not everyone would know that I have done my little bit fighting the Catholic bishops within the structures of the Church to try to have them on the public record in this sort of way. I certainly do not want to take any claim for what the bishops or Michael Costigan have achieved. But for me it is wonderfully refreshing to find a statement like this coming from the Catholic Church. It has not been seen in this sort of way in recent times. Its statements have more concerned personal morality. It is very refreshing that we have this kind of statement from the Catholic Church. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Chamarette would understand, my emphasis and the way I might appreciate this could be slightly different from hers&mdash;and I am unashamed about that, coming as I do from the Labor Party. I take considerable comfort from the emphases of this document, although I will certainly not claim that it is a statement for and on behalf of the Labor Party; indeed it is not. But it is very clear that a lot of the Labor Party policies directly address the same sorts of philosophies that this document addresses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is good to have ex-Senator Chaney; what a contribution he is to a considered and thoughtful approach to things&mdash;calling a group of the Church leftist! In fact some of us might say, `Isn't that splendid? We have been looking for that title for members of the Catholic Church for a long time'. But a lot of the Catholic Church has always been leftist in the rightist sort of way. And I would suggest that one might just want to trawl through the history of the Catholic Church&mdash;for example, its deep divisions in Latin America, where liberation theology has been some of the thought that has emerged from catholicism in that area at the same time as a very conservative dimension of the Catholic Church was totally opposed to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the battle between different elements in society is reflected very faithfully amongst the Catholic Church population. Mr Chaney, in labelling a certain group of people leftist, may&mdash;as Senator Chamarette says&mdash;merely be using a term of abuse, but I think also a term of some accuracy. What is inaccurate is to call them ideologues. To have a view that is nominally, in parenthesis, leftist does not mean that one is an ideologue at all. It may indeed mean that one has an emphasis on the importance of the community, the common good, as a priority or at least as being equal with the concern one would have for individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former Senator Chaney is remembered by me because of one statement he made in this place which I like to cite very often. He stood up in this place and said, `This Labor Government stands accused because its priority concern has been for the poor'.

Senator Knowles should not worry; I had great fun telling Senator Chaney, as he was at the time, what I thought of that kind of line. He was precisely right: this Government has a priority concern for the poor. This Labor Party grew out of a concern for people in society who were not represented in the decision making areas, a concern for people who did not have a voice, who did not have equity, who did not have a claim on any of the wealth or the opportunities of education or of health care. The history of my own State of South Australia in the 1890s makes excellent reading. I have trawled across some of it because in that time that State gave the vote to women. In earlier times women did not even have a voice in our parliaments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A reading of this history also brought me in touch with the emergence of the Trades and Labour Council and the foundation of the Labor Party. The people whom the women were representing and whom the Labor Party were representing were all those who had no real claim on the common good. They had no voice to articulate or to represent what they wanted, who they wanted to represent them, or who they wanted to be able to make decisions about their access to the common good. It is a delight to find this document from the Catholic Bishops of Australia, although it is not without precedent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a long time the Catholic Church has been documenting, through its encyclicals, this sort of concern&mdash;the concern of balancing the rights of individuals against the need for the common good. In 1891 it was writing an encyclical of some considerable importance. It makes one interested to meditate on just what were the pressures as a result of which  that encyclical emerged&mdash;a document that was not at all out of step with what was happening in the Australian society. The same issues were being pushed onto the public agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things this document is concerned with is social justice. As a child in primary school in a modest Brigidine convent in Victoria, I learnt about social justice; indeed, I learnt about encyclicals. So later on when I grew up and joined the Labor Party and people were talking about this exciting motion of social justice, I had to say to myself, `It's not the first time I've met it'. The first time I came across the concerns for social justice was in my home and through the Catholic Church's teaching. I am very pleased to see that in a public document and public debate the Church is now putting some of those issues back into the public arena with the weight of considered and deliberative thought on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to recognise that it is the Labor Party and this Labor Government that has a policy of social justice. As a member of a Labor government, I feel very comfortable in taking great heart from this document, because there is a lot with which the Labor Party's philosophies concur or coincide in this notion of the common wealth for the common good. We are a Party that has a social justice policy; we are a Party that has concern for those people who are not able to represent themselves. If one looks at the policies implemented by this Labor Government over the last eight or nine years, one sees that they have very much gone to the heart of redistribution of the power, opportunities, and the wealth of this country so that we move towards a common participation of all people, or as many people as possible, in the society that we call Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not take any comfort for the many, many people who are currently unemployed and enduring the hardships of that state, but I do take comfort from a Party that is concerned to provide educational opportunities for everyone, and that the education provided to our boys and girls is no longer to be distinguished. In times past, girls had many fewer educational opportunities. In times past, boys and girls from the wrong side of the tracks had little claim on a good education. We have seen those dramatic changes in education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators in this place will not be surprised to know that I am very proud of the Labor Party's Medicare. It is founded on those principles of universality drawn out in this document; in other words, a place in the common good, of fairness according to people's means, not according to how much one can make, and of providing accessible opportunity for people to have the health care they need. Health care and education are probably two of the basic planks of a socially just society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week I went to the Hills in Adelaide to open two homes for people with disability. These people will now be able to live in the community in homes specially designed for them. They are no longer dependent on the care of family or of institutions in the way they had been in the past. This Labor Government has been concerned, in collaboration with local government and local community, to enable people with disability to move into the community and live much more lives that provide them with more opportunity in a society that does not distinguish them or discriminate against them because of their disability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government also saw it as right and proper to support people at the Paralympics. Of course, we are not entirely responsible for that movement; largely the opportunity for people with disability has been something those people have fought for and that is why it is so authentic. We have been delighted to support that because once again we are a society that says all people should have an opportunity to take a place in that society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any of us here who can cast our minds back to what it was like even as recently as 10 but certainly 20 years ago would know that people with disability were largely required to hide themselves from society, not to participate in it. Slowly, the people with disability have taught the rest of us that they have an equal place in society and are able to contribute in a whole variety of ways once they have that opportunity to participate. This Government supports that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our policies for people with disability are one of the hallmarks of this Government as a compassionate and caring government. So also are our achievements&mdash;of course not sufficient, but very remarkable&mdash;on behalf of Aboriginal people in this country. The history of how Aboriginal people have been provided for in this country is one of shame. The sooner we replace that history the better. I am very pleased that we have a treaty that is asking all Australians to come to terms with the rights and the claim to justice of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This document tends to ask us to look much more away from individual social policies towards what are the impacts of economic policies. It says that one does not actually address social justice by getting the economy right. What we must do is reframe our thinking so that we have principles of concern and understanding of the importance and value of individual people. We can then look at the importance of creating wealth and people's opportunity to participate in the creation of that wealth. Then, very importantly, we can look at just, equitable redistribution mechanisms. That is what I think this Labor Government has done. I have no shame at all and no discomfort as a member of the Labor Party in aligning myself with the broad principles contained in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Common Wealth for the Common Good</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I note an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> called `Hewson's soft sell'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition Leader John Hewson said last night he wanted to bring a `human touch' to his hard-line economic theories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a bid to soften his image of a cold-hearted economics professor, Dr Hewson said good economics should be devoted to promoting `human happiness and well-being'.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is needed is a good understanding of economics and a disciplined economic thought process, tempered by a human touch&mdash;a sensitivity to the needs of the people&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would say to Dr Hewson, `You don't add a soft touch after you've established your hard-hearted economic policies'. This document is saying that we have to move away and have the care and compassion, the philosophy, that actually drives the economic policies. I believe that is a very important challenge to the Australian society. How do we value people? Is it because they have $100,000 and a smart car; or is it because they are people, they are born and they live in this society? I believe it should be that. It ought to be that we value people and that we write our economic policies to take account of that value of people&mdash;not adding a soft touch or a human touch after the hard line economic policies have been established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anybody reading the Fightback package would have to be very concerned about whether those opposite could seriously claim to have compassion in their concern for the people of Australia. In the health area, the Fightback package is about redistributing the health dollar away from the public, away from the common good and away from access for individuals to the private AMA, to the specialists and to the private insurance industry. In every way, that health policy runs counter not only to Labor Party policy but also to a concern for universal compassion for people. I would have thought, just looking at the health policy, let alone at any other part of the document of those opposite, that we have to ask ourselves what sense they have of the common good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that the priority of those opposite is individualism: if people can make it, then okay, they will be supported; if they cannot, they will be dropped off and forgotten. That is exactly the opposite of what I, as a Labor Party person, stand up and say, of what I want to promote and of what values I hold as important. The Opposition, I think, does put the higher priority on individualism. One of the things we need to say to Australia is: what does it mean to take to one's heart the common good? What does it mean to take account of everybody's opportunity to participate in the wealth that can be created? Can we seriously say that we move away from the policy of greed, of individual achievements and success bought at the price of other people and the devil take the hindmost? I do not believe we can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a woman in Australian society, I have had the pleasure and privilege of being part of recent history that has seen a significant change in the achievements and recognition of women. Women have been a part of society that has been excluded in the past. Under this Labor Government, they have had extensive recognition of their rights and opportunities to participate, to contribute and to play their part for the common good. I am sure that Mr Costigan would know that within the Catholic Church the challenge about the rights and position of women is a debate that is ongoing&mdash;and that might be the kindest way to describe it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In talking about the debate that is ongoing and recognition of the rights for all, whatever their gender, health status, disability or colour, I certainly also enjoy the fact that, if one is in Australia, the debate about one's claim on a piece of, and one's right to participate in producing, the wealth of this country ought to see no distinctions between people on any of those criteria. It is the Labor Party, the Labor Government, that has moved in its years of office since 1983 to extend dramatically the opportunities for all people to participate. It has extended dramatically the rights for people not to be discriminated against. These are matters that go to the heart of what is meant by `the common good'. Nobody can be excluded from participating. This Labor Government has made its policies to take account of its principal concern for the rights of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that Senator Chamarette made the point that the statement of the Catholic bishops says, `Reducing taxes is not necessarily the way nearer to God'. I am pleased to note that. I was recently in Washington and, as I wandered along whatever street it was, I passed the Treasury building where chiselled in stone was a quote from Oliver Wendell Holmes: `Tax is the price we pay for living in a civilised society'. It would seem to me that we need to be reminded of that from time to time. What do we do when we pay taxes? We actually contribute to the common good. I think the argument of reducing taxes as low as we can go means that we reduce the opportunity for fairness and equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The goods and services tax is a classic example of getting that wrong. It is redistributive: it distributes away from the poor to the rich. On that ground alone, we would have to condemn the Opposition's policy as not taking account of what is the common good but what is the best for the most. It is based on individualism. It is celebrating the opportunity for those who can to get it and those who cannot to be forgotten. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy of all that is that not one solution is offered. We simply heard statements that care and compassion for people are important and that somehow what matters is living in dignity. We all understand that. It is not debasing the commitment to say that they are truisms in Australian society. However, it does not help to discover a solution if one stands up, as Senator Crowley did, and rabbit on for about 20 minutes as though somehow the Labor Party did have a mortgage on social justice and, as a result, it had saved the vast majority of Australians and it had somehow delivered them into human dignity and out of poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts flatly contradict all that. There are 700,000 children living without a breadwinner, 200,000 young unemployed and one and a half million people out of work, given up looking for work or simply underemployed. These are all tragic social statistics. As we well know, during the last 10 years those people on average weekly earnings have had their real disposable income cut by 4.7 per cent, whilst those on six times average weekly earnings have had their income increased by 6.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the tragic statistics of what we have been through in recent times. I do not think it is greatly helpful to say that somehow that means that Labor has got it wrong in every respect, nor does it do justice to anyone to argue that somehow Labor has got it right in every respect, as Senator Crowley was almost trying to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to look at the limitations of politics and what can be sensibly achieved within the political system. From my side of politics one cannot do better than refer to a speech given as recently as last night by Dr Hewson, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no room for economic ideologues in economic policy making or in politics, just as there is no room for left wing ideologues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is needed is a good understanding of economics, and a disciplined economic thought process, tempered by a human touch&mdash;a sensitivity to the needs of the people&mdash;to move Australia towards the goal of a just and democratic society.</PARA>
<PARA>What the bishops have done&mdash;and I applaud them for doing it&mdash;is to address an issue which must be of great concern. If there are disparities of wealth and people are being left behind in society, then the first thing one does is acknowledge that and identify the problems. It may be necessary, but it is certainly not sufficient to then wring one's hands and pretend that somehow the current system has failed and anyone who in any way espouses market economics is impliedly lacking in care and compassion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was really the thrust of Senator Chamarette's contribution. She declined to put forward an alternative approach. Implicit in most of what she said&mdash;and in many of those people who would somehow condemn market based economic approaches&mdash;is that there is a fundamental distrust of the market and that somehow the solutions to these problems lie in more and better forms of welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We only have to look at the classic welfare state of Sweden which has just cut back social welfare by about $10 billion. Senators will remember that Sweden has a smaller population than that of Australia. Sweden has done this because it can no longer afford it and it also recognises that there has to be a growing economy in order to provide for those needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that should have become clear in recent years&mdash;and I think the bishops acknowledge it, although, quite clearly, the Commission on Social Welfare does not&mdash;is that there have been a number of false gods and socialism has been one of them. The collapse of socialism in eastern Europe is stark evidence of the fact that it was premised on a false system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One cannot do much better than examine the words of Leo XIII in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rerum Novarum</EMPHASIS> when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is impossible to reduce human society to a level. The Socialists may do their utmost, but all striving against nature is vain. There naturally exists among mankind differences of the most important kind; people differ in capability, in diligence, in health, and in strength; and unequal fortune is a necessary result of equality of condition. Such inequality is far from being disadvantageous either to individuals or to the community; social and public life can only go on by the help of various kinds of capacity and the playing of many parts, and each man, as a rule, chooses the part which peculiarly fits his case.</PARA>
<PARA>One would not even attempt to do better than that, but in terms of applying moral precepts to practical economic solutions, one simply cannot ignore the laws of economics, much and all as it may be distasteful to those who have a deep and abiding suspicion of the market place. They abound to this very day and, indeed, Professor Brennan talked only recently of one William Temple, a former Archbishop of Canterbury, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the Christian there are two options&mdash;socialism or heresy.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Brennan refers to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an apparently widespread conviction that Christianity faithfully pursued leads inexorably to the primacy of `social justice' among political ideals, and that some form of socialism is the only way in which such social justice can be secured.</PARA>
<PARA>We all have a commitment to social justice, hard and all as it may be at times to define it, but the reality is that economic issues need to be addressed in a practical and sensible way, as again was said only last year in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Centesimus Annus</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent years the range of such intervention has vastly expanded to the point of creating a new type of State, the so-called Welfare State. This has happened in some countries in order to respond better to many needs and demands by remedying forms of poverty and deprivation unworthy of the human person. However, excesses and abuses, especially in recent years, have provoked very harsh criticisms of the Welfare State. . . . . . By intervening directly and depriving society of its responsibility, the social assistance state leads to a loss of human energies and an inordinate increase of public agencies which are dominated more by bureaucratic ways of thinking than by concern for serving their clients and which are accompanied by an enormous increase in spending.</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot do better than quote Father James Sadowsky, a Jesuit who is a professor of philosophy at Fordham University in New York. He says in a very useful pamphlet, and some of the points will have to be skimmed over because of the shortness of time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course Christians should do what is right by the poor&mdash;the question is how to help them. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no one, clear solution to poverty, no revealed economics. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Christians who propose schemes for poverty relief ought to know the laws of economics. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where is the argument to show that over the long haul the quantity possessed by the poor would be greater if only the rich possessed less?. . . A very good case can be made to the effect that the market has made both the rich and the poor richer. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only solution that fits economic reality is to raise productivity and profitability. That means less government intervention. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Christians who would really help the poor must work within the limits of economic laws.</PARA>
<PARA>All I can say is that I think the Catholic bishops well understand the realities of life. They are not in the business of preferring economic models. They have quite deliberately eschewed pronouncing that one or other political party has the preferred wisdom. They maintain their responsibility to ensure that moral precepts guide decision making, and we applaud that in its entirety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We acknowledge that those who simply concern themselves with greater wealth, greed and consumerism are contributing to the evils of society and that poverty alleviation is an imperative for all decision makers, all concerned Christians, for the middle class and the rich alike; but it is the solutions to the problems that we argue over, and we ought to do that in good faith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to acknowledge that no-one has a monopoly on wisdom, that there are solutions that have to be addressed with a hard-nosed, not a somehow bleeding heart, approach, and that unless one is prepared to engage in sensible economic analysis one is not doing justice to the cause; one is in fact distorting the true picture which is that hard decisions have to be made. One cannot simply imply that somehow, with a bit more care and compassion, there is a pain-free solution that will commend itself if only people would discover it and put it into place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that, in many respects, the Government will never deliver us spiritual salvation, let alone economic salvation. Much is required of individuals. That does not mean leaving behind those who cannot care for themselves. We are very much committed to a welfare safety net. We acknowledge the need for welfare, but we wish to promote a society which will create more jobs and will provide the human dignity that is so essential by giving people the opportunities to look after themselves as much as possible. If we go down that path, we are on the way to building an affordable and caring society&mdash;one to which we can all contribute and one from which we will get benefits that we have derived for ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To simply imply, as many do, that solutions lie with government and that somehow it is a lack of consideration on the part of decision makers that put us into the plight we are in at the moment is far too simplistic.

Our national impoverishment has continued as our international debt has grown, pushed along by entrepreneurs borrowing overseas.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter of public importance also talks about structures. What are the structures which underlie our attitudes towards wealth, poverty, greed and consumerism? I think the obvious structures are the education system, the mass media, the legal system and the political system. We have a mass media, the worst of which trivialises and deals in stereotypes, such as the ones we always hear, which add nothing to the overall important debate. It glorifies confrontation, greed and consumerism and pays little attention to the outdated notions in its values of social responsibility and community service. We have a legal system which properly recognises private property rights but which is accessible much more to those with greater resources. Wealth is protected and reinforced by the legal system, especially in respect of taxation matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The political system is the worst structural impediment to fair policies on wealth and poverty.

He was involved in a debate on Sunday night on John Cleary's program. I thought that program also missed that point very substantially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the detail we find that since 1983, since the Labor Government came to power, there has been a belief that the market system, unguided by government regulation, would deliver the sorts of socially just outcomes that the bishops are concerned about&mdash;give more to the rich, the rich will then invest in productive enterprise and through the trickle down effect the economy will boom and therefore the poor by that process will also be involved in that materially enriching process. It has not happened and it will not happen because the model leaves all those other factors out of consideration. What lies behind the Fightback package is precisely the same philosophy. That philosophy says that if we simply re-jig the economy, lower the tax rate&mdash;I point out that of all the OECD countries, along with America, we share the second lowest tax rate in the world&mdash;and give more to the rich that money will somehow find its way into productive investment under a deregulated economy which simply has not happened and will not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to pick up on one point because there is very limited time to speak. A moment ago Senator Herron mentioned the decrease in the price of petrol. Senator Herron ignores the fact that Australia has some of the worst air pollution of major cities in the world, we have the second lowest rate of taxation on petrol and we have the third lowest price of petrol of all the OECD countries. He also ignores the fact that under a lower tax regime, plus 15 per cent GST on public transport fares, the poor would be very seriously disadvantaged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for the brief opportunity it has afforded me today to lend my voice of support and commendation for the statement by the Catholic bishops on the distribution of wealth in Australia. On many occasions since I came into this place in 1986 I have called for a wealth inquiry. A quick look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, particularly in 1986, 1987 and 1988, shows that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This statement is the product of a project, as we have heard in the debate, undertaken by the Catholic bishops who also held the view that such an inquiry should be undertaken. As I have said, I believe it is something that governments should have done and should do, as the bishops have now said. Perhaps the Government wishes that it had done it because it may be a little embarrassing for the major parties, as the motion before us says, to be told the awful truth by such an eminent and unbiased group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not need to talk about how the project came about; that has been done in this debate. I agree with Archbishop Clancy when he says in the foreword to the report that many people recognise and:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">consider that the churches are well placed to comment on socio-economic developments, and in particular to call for the insertion of moral values into the debate; to advocate a more explicit recognition by decision-makers that their policies require an ethical basis; and to urge members of the community at every level, inspired by the idea of solidarity, to promote the common good by taking remedial action against injustice and inequity.</PARA>
<PARA>I would do my fellow parliamentarians the credit of saying that most people come into this place at least with that motivation. I suppose it is a question of what happens to that in the process of performing our duties here, but that is something we could talk about another day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is very much that is valuable and timely in this report. Of course, time is very short. I refer to a point made in chapter 6 which is entitled `Imbalances in the Distribution of Wealth and some of their Structural Causes'. I will not quote the whole paragraph because I do not have time. I am referring to the issue of the trickle down effect, which is questioned in the report. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . but history does not show that the so-called trickle-down process either eradicates poverty and disadvantage, or results in a more equitable society.</PARA>
<PARA>It is the trickle down effect that is relied upon by the economic rationalists under whom we have suffered for the past decade or so, and it does not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report goes on to discuss taxation. If there is one thing that might come out of this report that would be of enormous benefit to good government in this country it is that people would look at what the report says about taxation and would look at the reality about taxation on Australians&mdash;the reality that we are third bottom in the OECD ranking as a country in terms of taxation. According to the OECD report 1990 figures, the latest available to us, fairly recently reported, only the US and Turkey taxed their citizens less. If we could come to terms with that reality and if we could look at taxation the way the bishops ask us to look at it, better government might very well be ahead of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment we have a situation where whatever the economic circumstances, and whether we can afford it or not, all too often the refuge of major political parties in their drive for government, which is what our democracy is all about, is the fistful of dollars&mdash;the tax cuts. Right at this very moment as we approach an election, in a gruellingly long unofficial election campaign, that is what both sides are offering each in their own way. The issue of tax cuts is being challenged in some quarters. I want to lend my voice to that. If from this report we can have a public which is less able to be appealed to by virtue of its hip pocket nerve and its selfishness, then I think this report will have achieved something in the common good. </PARA>

It reminds us of the wonderful teachings and example of Christ, the founder of the church. It reminds us of the principles which flow from those teachings. Amongst those principles which have influenced me and quite a large number of people is the dignity of each individual human being&mdash;the recognition that each individual human being is created by God and has an eternal destiny. That is a destiny which is designed to ensure that that person has everlasting communion with God.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This document reminds us that individuals have rights of life and a whole range of other rights which precede the rights of the state&mdash;rights which the state is obligated to uphold. These rights include the freedom of the individual and the freedom of conscience of individuals. Another right is the fundamental importance of the family, which is the fundamental group unit of society based on marriage between a man and a woman voluntarily entered into for life. I remind the Senate that that is the definition in the Family Law Act&mdash;strange as it may seem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of social justice has, of course, been very close to my heart through my involvement with workers in the trade union movement. Other rights are the preservation of the common good and the principle of subsidiarity. That principle provides that power should reside with the smallest group capable of efficiently performing the functions for which power is required, so that those over whom the power is exercised have greater control over the people who exercise that power. This is called neo-democracy. The gift of the earth to all humanity is something that very often we forget in our troubled times within this country. People in many less developed countries have far more problems than we can ever think of or imagine. In terms of Christian charity, we have a duty to them. It is not just an option; it is a duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been somewhat disappointed in this debate for two reasons: first, we do not have enough time properly to discuss this matter; and secondly, the political point scoring that has gone on, from the sort of self-righteousness that was exhibited by Senator Crowley to some of the other comments that have been made in the chamber. I think the bishops would be offended by what Senator Crowley said. It is a relief to see bishops making comments about principles and the importance of morals when economic matters are being considered, rather than, as she suggested, dealing virtually only with issues of personal morality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an insult to the bishops. Has she not heard of those great and recent documents of the Church?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Department of Social Security has one of the most sophisticated strategies for detecting incorrect payments and fraud in the world today. It aims to achieve three main objectives:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">first, to prevent incorrect payments and fraud from occurring;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">second, to detect discrepancies at the earliest possible stage; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">third, to deal decisively with the cases which are detected and to create public recognition of the consequences of attempting to defraud the system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Data-matching Program is an important part of the system of controls the Department has in place to achieve these objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, in the 18 months that the Data-matching Program has been operating, substantial savings have been achieved and will continue to be achieved through the detection and correction of incorrect payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government expects to save $161.8 million this year rising to $204.2 million in 1995-96 from the Program. In  social security outlays alone savings of $146.9 million, increasing to $193.1 million in 1995-96, are expected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am confident, Mr President, that the Data-matching Program is a cost-effective means of detecting fraud and incorrect payments, contributing to the framework of controls in place to provide Australia with a tightly controlled income support system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The costs of the Program for the Department of Social Security, have been associated mainly with the collection of five million tax file numbers and with the implementation of the Program. The running costs of the Program in future years will be small.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, while most people are honest, there are a few who deliberately provide incorrect information so that they can get more than their proper entitlements. People's compliance with the law increases when they know that the Department of Social Security has effective controls in its system to detect incorrect payments and fraud. When voluntary compliance is taken into account the savings attributable to the Data-matching Program reach further than the directly measurable outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has also provided for the use of the Data-matching Program to increase access to additional assistance to families in need. Families with children who already receive a Family Allowance payment and who may be eligible for increased assistance in the form of Family Allowance Supplement but have not applied for it, can be identified through data-matching. Since early August 1992 my Department has issued invitations to apply for Family Allowance Supplement to 50,000 families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some people were sceptical about how such a program could maintain a balance between protecting public expenditure and individual privacy. But it is clear that this balance has been achieved in the operation of the Data-matching Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Department has fully integrated the privacy safeguards prescribed in the legislation into its operating procedures. Administering the Program within such a strict framework has not been without some cost. However, considered against the standards and procedures the Department would have adopted in the absence of externally imposed restrictions, any additional cost has been at the margin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department is working hard in consultation with the Privacy Commissioner to ensure the protection of individual privacy. The costs have been more than offset by the benefits which have:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">strengthened the safeguards already in place to keep personal information safe and secure;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">ensured that the Program is conducted in a manner which avoids any unnecessary intrusion into privacy; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">enhanced the Department's capacity to protect public expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the low level of complaints and appeals generated by the Program are evidence of the Department's careful implementation of the Program within the privacy safeguards set for it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am confident that, after honourable senators have had the opportunity to consider the agency reports, you will agree that there are substantial benefits to be gained from continuing with the Program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After the 1987 election when the Australia Card was soundly knocked on the head by the ability of this chamber to disallow a regulation, the Government proceeded step by step to achieve by two methods what it had intended to achieve through the Australia Card: first, through the tax file number, and secondly through the Health Insurance Commission Medicare file number. We see, slowly but surely as time marches on, the aims and objectives of the Australia Card being achieved through other means.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the former Treasurer brought in the concept of upgrading of the integrity of the tax file number, he made a promise which, like most of his other promises, he did not keep. He said that the tax file number would not be extended any further except for use by the Tax Office. What did we see? In the spring of 1990&mdash;I will not be held to that date&mdash;we were approached and told, `Well, what we really need now to ensure that people do not cheat on the social security system is to be able to extend the use of that tax file number to check those people who are in receipt of social security'. This chamber expressed concern and that Bill was sent to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which examined it in detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government came to the leaders of the Opposition and the Democrats and said, `If you don't pass this, millions and millions of dollars of savings will be lost'. When we look at these reports we see that the savings that were to be achieved were not as great as the Government had said. But given that we accepted that, through the committee process and the committee stage of the legislation in this place we imposed more stringent requirements with respect to privacy on data-matching. I believe that it was evidenced that this chamber plays an important role in being able to put checks and balances on the Executive and the Government to ensure, in this instance, that the privacy of individuals who receive social security was recognised and respected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under that legislation, each of departments which are involved in data-matching are required to present reports, and today we are discussing such a report. I want to go through some of the things that are in the report of the Department of Social Security. I should point out I received the report only just before lunch time. Some things concern me as I flick through it. One can see on page 9 the slow, insidious creep of the infringement of our privacy. Somebody said that we lose our freedoms bit by bit. I have forgotten who it was. The other day I tried to look for the quote in one of my quote books&mdash;one of my hobbies is collecting quote books. However, I could not find the reference. But here is an example of us losing out freedoms bit by bit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later on in the report, the Department complains a little about having to make these reports; it is a bit onerous having to do so. But I will tell honourable senators why it is important that it does. The following statement is made on page 9 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A time and date for the delivery of data are scheduled for each agency. The data, in the form of computer tapes or cartridges, is securely sealed in containers and delivered by hand to the Data-Matching Agency. The deliveries are made by nominated officers of the source agencies, receipts are provided and the transactions are recorded.</PARA>
<PARA>This paragraph refers to when a data match is required, and the data is taken by transport&mdash;by truck or car, I suppose&mdash;in secured containers and delivered by hand to the data matching agency, which happens to be located in Social Security. We insisted on this. We asked that that be the method by which it be done, and we were told that was the way in which it was to be done&mdash;that the data would be taken physically. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the completion of a data-matching cycle, all data on the cartridges is destroyed before they are returned in the same manner to the source agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While these arrangements ensure that the data is transferred safely and securely, they are administratively cumbersome.</PARA>
<PARA>I remember that at the time this was going on I visited Social Security and had a chat to people there. At one point, when the data matching was first starting, I went into one of the buildings and there were ranges of data on small cartridges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first question I asked was, `Could this data be dumped onto an IBM computer outside the Department and accessed?'. `Yes', was the answer. I asked, `Do you have some way of making sure that somebody doesn't pop one in their pocket?'. It is very useful commercially to have lists of data of people who are on social security. One may not want to send them mailings, for commercial reasons&mdash;they are less likely to be able to buy expensive video equipment, take out insurance policies or whatever. So mailings can be reduced. So this does have commercial value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They said, `Well, no, Senator, we don't'. I said, `Wouldn't it be a good idea to think about having a mechanism so that if somebody takes it out a bleeper goes, the same as when somebody walks into a dress shop, fancies a dress, hasn't got the money and walks out with it, and a bleeper goes.'  Yes, they could, and now they have a system. In the new Tuggeranong offices they have a system where the tapes are bar coded, and if somebody were to walk out with them they would make a noise. When I was visiting the new office one of the officers said to me, `Here's your arch'. I do not know whether he meant my arch, or `your arch' in the vernacular. I presumed it was my arch because that was one of the things I thought that they should introduce and even if it does not have an effect, I see it as my arch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also asked, `When you are shifting this data backwards and forwards between departments, do you have a log-on time when people leave the department and a log-on time when they get to the data matching source?'. `No', was the answer. I said, `I think you ought to, and it ought to be secure. People could stop off on their way from Tuggeranong to wherever they are going and dump the data down somewhere, and then take it on in'. I feel that, even as an Opposition member, you can have some influence on the great bureaucracy by keeping on asking questions. Now they have the data transferred safely and securely. But the report says to us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is both time consuming and resource intensive to transfer the data between source agencies and the Data-Matching Agency manually.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not have to read the rest to tell the Senate what it is going to say. It is going to tell us, `It would be so much easier if we could do it on line'. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department believes that it would be more efficient and more secure if the data could be transferred through on-line computer connections. It would be appropriate that a protocol for such transfers be agreed with the Privacy Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA>Bit by bit they get their way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we did not have these reports how would we know that that is what departments were thinking of?  The public thinks the Government tells us everything and departments tell us everything about the way they are going to do things, but they  do not. We are the representatives of the people, and all those hundreds who are on social security in Clayton, where my office is located&mdash;they are the people I am concerned about. They give up some of their privacy when they take social security, but as much as of it as possible should be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My maiden question here in this chamber was about social security microfiche floating around the streets of Toorak&mdash;dropped, with details of people's names and addresses and what their incomes were. That is an appalling lack of consideration for people's privacy, and here we have a little bit more. I can see the Department wanting to have an on-line connection. What does that mean? It makes it more accessible to hackers. It makes it more accessible to people who would use that data unscrupulously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that honourable senators in this chamber are with me. I am sure that Senator Harradine, and Senator Powell who has taken a particular interest in this area, and many colleagues on this side&mdash;Senator Vanstone and Senator Kemp, who were involved in the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee&mdash;will, with me, address this issue to ensure that we do not give away our freedoms bit by bit. If it is a bit onerous, and if it is a bit cumbersome, let it be that way, but do not let us always have technology driving what happens. Let us discuss as a community: do we have to accept the fact that it is technologically easier to do it? Should we be examining all these things?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said in this chamber before that I believe that one of the major issues of the 1990s will be the storage and retrieval of data, and the infringement of our privacy as that becomes easier and people say, `It's cheaper and it's more economical', and gradually we give away our freedoms bit by bit. One day we might regret that, when we cannot turn back the tide. Somebody will say, `You were in the chamber, you were in parliament in those days, why didn't you say something?  Why didn't you stand up and make sure that our privacy was protected?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Page 10 of the report, under `Technical standards', states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under guideline 4 the Data-Matching Agency was required to produce a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Technical Standards Report</EMPHASIS>. This report outlines the standards to be adopted in relation to data quality, integrity and security. The guidelines required that all agencies complied with the report.</PARA>
<PARA>It says, gratuitously:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effort put into production of the report was considered worthwhile because it serves to document the technical architecture of the Program. The discipline of producing the report was a useful vehicle for the identification and resolution of technical issues which would have had to be addressed anyway. It also meant that all agencies were involved in setting standards for the Program which were endorsed by the Privacy Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA>It was an insistence by this Parliament that we have those standards, and I found that comment in that section of the report somewhat gratuitous. Page 12 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reporting requirements imposed by the legislation are stringent and a lot of time and effort is needed to comply with them. They have, however, generated useful management information for agencies as well as providing proof of compliance with the spirit as well as the letter of the law.</PARA>
<PARA>I would hope that all departments in data matching would comply with the spirit as well as the letter of the law. That is what we should expect of them. They should not just say, `We have to do this because this is what is set down in legislation'. They should be doing better than best in terms of protecting people's rights, and they should be addressing the spirit as well as the letter of the law. Listen to this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the Department's view that if the Program is allowed to continue, greater reliance should be placed on the Privacy Commissioner's monitoring role and further reports to Parliament should be through the Annual Reports of agencies.</PARA>
<PARA>Sorry, I think no to that. I trust the Privacy Commissioner. I have been out to Tuggeranong and seen the Privacy Commissioner's officers working there, monitoring data matching and, yes, I think that is important. But a few pages in the annual report of the agency will not suffice to address the sorts of questions we are asking here. I do not think the Department would put the suggestion in an annual report of an agency that it really would like to have data matching on line rather than being taken physically backwards and forwards on tapes. That is not the sort of thing that comes out in an annual report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge honourable senators, despite the fact that it is somewhat onerous, to ask that we continue to ask departments to produce this sort of information to enable us, as representatives of the people&mdash;especially those people who may be less likely and less able to protect their rights&mdash;to protect their rights through us and through this Parliament. I do not believe it is appropriate just to have this issue, which I see as major, appearing in annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report goes on at page 13, in the conclusion of the chapter on privacy safeguards, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Data-matching Program great emphasis has been put on the protection of privacy and the security of personal information. Administering the Program within such a strict framework of privacy safeguards has not been without some cost. There has been some expenditure on equipment, printing and advertising, but the real cost has been in the time and effort of staff administering the Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, considered against the standards and procedures the Department would have adopted in the absence of an externally prescribed modus operandi, any additional cost has been very much at the margin.</PARA>
<PARA>So they are saying that it is not all that much in terms of cost. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is considered that the costs have been more than offset by the benefits which have strengthened the safeguards already in place to keep personal information safe and secure, ensure that the program is conducted in a manner which avoids any unnecessary intrusion into privacy and enhances the Department's capacity to protect public expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA>Social Security, I believe, has tried to address this issue of privacy. The Committee procedure that went on here and the analysis of that Bill made that legislation tighter. The constraints on the departments involved in data matching were made tighter. I believe that this data matching is better for that process. As I said before, I think it is important that we see that information in this sort of form, not in the annual report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report confirms what the coalition has been saying for nearly two years. The financial estimates for the savings that would have been derived from data matching were never any more than guesstimates which, over time, have been proved to be totally inaccurate. When we sat in the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, I was absolutely sure that the savings that the Department was saying that it would achieve would not be achieved because the basis of some of its figures was very rubbery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I point out just how inaccurate these data matching estimates have been, it is important to point out that these estimates are Department of Finance estimates, and that is the same department whose work the Keating Government regularly quotes in its thoroughly unsuccessful attempts to blow financial holes in our Fightback plan. How accurate and how well informed are these financial gurus? If their data matching estimates are any indication, I can only conclude that they are atrociously inaccurate and not very well informed at all. So should we place any credence in their analysis of Fightback? Again, if these estimates are any indication, I would think we should place no credence in them at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in, I think it was, spring of 1990, when the data matching legislation was introduced by the Government, the Parliament was told that it would result in annual savings of approximately $300m. It was lauded as a centrepiece of the fraud identification techniques of the Department of Social Security. When we in the Senate proposed to change one mere word, what happened? Prime Minister Hawke wrote to the Leader of the Opposition claiming that $150m would be lost and that we would be held accountable for the loss. We were going to change one word in the Bill. Every time the coalition&mdash;and, I admit, Democrat senators as well&mdash;questioned the savings which would be derived through data matching, we were given assurance after assurance that the estimates were totally accurate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the truth is out, and we see these reports. The Government's original estimate of the savings for the Department of Social Security during the 1991-92 financial year was $290m, but the actual savings were $23m. When the first data matching report was tabled in this place about a year ago, I again expressed my concern about the accuracy of the original estimates. After I had spoken&mdash;and I knew that that first report was not based on a full year, and I said that&mdash;I received a letter from the new Minister for Social Security, Dr Blewett, chiding me and claiming that it would be useful if `I corrected what appeared to be some misunderstanding about the matter'. He then told me in the letter that the annual savings estimates were based on the operation of a fully implemented program, and my comparison was invalid because the program was not yet fully operational. Then Dr Blewett stated in the letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you know, action is proceeding to achieve these outcomes and the results so far suggest that when they occur actual savings will be those close to estimated.</PARA>
<PARA>We wait with bated breath, because they still have not reached the estimates. I am telling the Senate that Dr Blewett was wrong. The original estimate for the 1992-93 financial year was savings of $300m for the Department of Social Security. The revised estimated savings are now $146m, which is less than half the original claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know when he thinks he will reach the estimates, but he cannot argue now that it has not been on a full data-matching year. The most outrageous estimate in the original savings figure, which was a savings from the data-matching retirees, has been revised downwards from $157m to $49m. Those estimates were wrong again. That information came from the Department of Finance which said it can analyse Fightback, get it all accurate, get it right, and it has been wrong on every occasion&mdash;about as wrong as the Health Insurance Commission was when it wanted to bring in the black box. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later this year the sunset clause for data-matching legislation will come into effect. At that time the Parliament will have to decide whether it considers it appropriate and desirable to continue with this particular method of identifying welfare fraud. Undoubtedly, the Government will be up to its old tricks and will hold a loaded gun at the head of the Opposition saying, `You'd better agree to this because look at all the savings we will lose'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before going any further, I would like some clarification from the Minister on this. On the subject of savings, in the Estimates Committee I received an answer to a question and I asked Senator McMullan and my other colleagues if we could incorporate that in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I just happened to be sitting here looking at the answer I got in Estimates, which is the same table which appears on page 105 of the report, and there are some anomalies. For example, the actual savings in the Estimates answer for income security for the retired is $6.29m; yet in this table here on page 105 it is $5.2m. Under income security for the unemployed the figure is $8m. In the answer provided in Estimates it is $3.72m&mdash;only a difference of $5m but the attitude is that we need not worry about $5m here or there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this table it does not say that it excludes running costs; in the other table it says it excludes running costs. That might be the explanation, and if it I would appreciate the answer from the Minister. If it is not, I would</PARA>
<PARA>appreciate knowing which of these tables we ought to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> as being the correct table of the actual savings of the data-matching program. However, I would seek leave to incorporate page 105 of the report in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, which is the document we are talking about. I would appreciate it if the Minister would explain the difference between the answer I got in Estimates and the information contained in this table.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case in point here the savings which the Government said would arise have not been achieved.

I call on honourable senators not to succumb to the Department's wishes and that they request that this sort of information be included in its annual report. I believe that it is very important.

It just makes it easier for the Department then to say, `We could do some other sort of data-matching' and gradually that process erodes our control over how that data is used. </PARA>

It is great to see in the annual report that the wine industry has had a very good year. It set a goal for 1993 of annual export sales in excess of $200m and it has achieved that. It has increased its sales by a spectacular 35.9 per cent. That really is good news for our export wine industry. </PARA>

We exported something like $91.5m worth of wine to the UK. It is interesting to note that the English, who once used to laugh at the Australian wines, are now realising that they are the best value for money. From talking to some of the locals, I found that they are looking at our wines much more favourably than they are the French wines because they believe our wines have more flavour and are better value for money.

<PARA>I have spoken before on the inappropriateness of efficiency audits by the Auditor-General in relation to the Department of Defence or any of its agencies because, quite simply, we are not dealing with a commercial venture which has a balance sheet and a profit and loss account. There is a degree of difference between the Department of Defence and its various agencies and any commercial activity. Nevertheless, I think it is important to read the Auditor-General's efficiency reports on defence agencies. I always read those with great interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is an efficiency audit into the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. The DSTO is the second largest scientific body in this country. It has about 3,400 employees and it is second only to CSIRO. It is a very important body. It has certainly been a very good investment, both for the nation and for the Department of Defence. This report notes that a year or two ago the Department of Finance had a look at the costs of savings introduced through research programs of DSTO when they were applied to the Department of Defence. In a certain period it showed that they covered 10 years' outlays in supporting the DSTO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever way we look at the DSTO, it has been very important. In a way, I do not think it is possible to overstate its importance. Australia is a country of vast geographic area&mdash;not to mention the surrounding sea over which we have a strategic interest&mdash;and our population is very low. We will never be able to defend this country adequately if we indulge ourselves in a defence philosophy that relies on human beings alone&mdash;or putting into the field armies of hundreds of thousands of troops on a continental scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will have to use available scientific techniques in order to have a good surveillance program enabling us to know what is going on in the area of our responsibility; to be able to collect the intelligence that we need; and to be able to identify in time any threats&mdash;which hopefully will not emerge&mdash;in order to deal with them before they land on the mainland of Australia. Given the constraints of the size of the country over which we have to operate and the population, we must use technology to the limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of that technology we can get from overseas. If it is made available to us, and at a reasonable cost, we certainly should avail ourselves of it. But the geography of Australia does pose particular and specific requirements on its defence equipment. Therefore, we do need our own defence science and technology organisation to be able to improve equipment that comes in from overseas and adapt it to the very high humidity, the high temperature range, and even the dust, of the Australian environment in which it will have to operate. This is necessary because most defence equipment is designed for the European theatre. Most of it was designed for NATO, for operations in cooler and gentler climates than exist particularly in the northern part of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a great interest in DSTO over the years. I also have had some concerns about it in recent years because a lot of change is occurring. The Government has shifted the DSTO's direction quite a bit. I accept that there was a need for change. I do not challenge that for one moment. I think DSTO was previously involved in areas of activity that are no longer a high priority. But it is also true that there has been a change in morale. Morale has been affected by the lack of a clear objective as to what the Government wants to do with DSTO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area where I have concerns about DSTO is that of the priorities for its research activities. I do not wish to diminish the importance of divisions like the Aeronautical Research Laboratory or the Materials Research Laboratory, the propellants and explosives divisions and all the rest of it. They are all very important. But I have always argued in public that we have to put a great deal of effort into the electromagnetic spectrum. We must dominate and control the electromagnetic spectrum to the limits of our ability because that really is the vital ground in modern defence. It is the area that involves all of our communications and most of our sensors. We simply cannot put too much effort into knowing and dominating that area. One of the areas of great concern to me over the years has been the ratio of funds that we devote to it, particularly into areas like electronic countermeasures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said all that, I would make the point that the purpose of DSTO really is to support the Australian Defence Force. While I would not want to rank priorities, I would certainly see Australia's defence as consisting of the Army, Navy and Air Force and DSTO; it is of that level of importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning now to the nature of the report before us, the Auditor-General's Report No. 2, I think it is important that the Auditor-General examines the DSTO, but in this report basically he is looking at its commercial activities. A couple of years ago the Government said that there were a lot of things that DSTO did that were saleable and that we should sell that intellectual property, those patents and those technologies which have an application in the private or commercial world. I do not have any argument with that at all. But what I do enter a plea for is balance. Reading the Auditor-General's report today, the feeling I had was that that balance is not necessarily reflected in their report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a matter of commonsense. Sure, if we can sell something and the community can benefit from using it and the Commonwealth can benefit from it financially, by all means let us do it. But we certainly cannot design DSTO so that it puts a sizeable part of its resources into earning money from the commercial development of its products. The report of the Auditor-General talks about forming alliances and getting industry involved in the early stages of research programs so that the application of that research can be funnelled or directed more smoothly into commercial applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to this matter of balance. The only reason we have DSTO is to do research that is not done by the commercial world; it is not done by the commercial world because the application of this particular research is specifically for the Department of Defence; and the primacy of the interests of the Department of Defence must be maintained. I noticed that one of the comments of the Department of Defence on this report makes that very point. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concept of strategic alliances was being discussed within DSTO before the audit. Alliances along both technology and project groupings are being considered. However, their establishment is conditional upon Government requirements for probity and equity and Defence's right to unfettered access to DSTO-developed technology.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important point. Not only must the prime interests of the Department be protected, but also we certainly cannot have a situation where research is funded without the Department having complete access to that research to use it in whatever way it wishes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I just emphasise the importance of balance. By all means, let us recoup from the civilian world appropriate scientific and technological achievements that are made by DSTO. But let us always remember that we would not have DSTO if that work could be done commercially and that the commercial spin-offs are a secondary and, in a sense, fortuitous outcome. This organisation has been very important to Australia in the past and, given the way that technology will certainly go on developing, it will be very important to Australia and its security in the decades ahead. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On close corporations, the Committee is currently inquiring into a proposed new legal framework for the incorporation and regulation of small business. We are in the midst of a program of public hearings which will be completed in Perth next week. It is the Committee's intention to report to Parliament on this matter by the end of November 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On audit committees, as part of its responsibility to monitor the general area of corporate law and regulation, the Committee has recently met with representatives of the auditing and valuing professions. Arising out of that meeting, the Committee will conduct a short investigation into the introduction of a requirement for audit committees on the boards of all publicly listed companies. The advantages of such committees are that they help to preserve the independence of auditors and ensure that supervision and knowledge of the audit function is vested in the full board of the company, not just the managers. The Committee will produce a report on this subject by the end of this session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to rewriting the corporations law, which has attracted a bit of attention in this morning's press, the Committee is also currently developing a proposal for a thorough redrafting of the corporations law. When introducing the Corporations Bill in 1989 the then Attorney-General, the Hon. Lionel Bowen, stated that the purpose of the Bill was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . establishment of a national scheme for the regulation of companies. . . the Bill for the most part, re-enacts the existing legal requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>While some tidying up took place, it was essentially a consolidation of the law and reform was to come later. Since the passing of the corporations law there has been a steady flow of amending legislation. Five amending Acts of varying complexity have been passed and two major Bills, the draft Corporate Law Reform Bill and the proposal for continuous disclosure, are currently in preparation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes that this piecemeal process of reform will produce an increasingly cumbersome piece of legislation. This is something that we have become aware of as we have moved around the country speaking to business people and professionals who have to actually apply the law. For example, there are already 1,371 sections, including a section 1076ZC, and the Act has been in force for less than two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advantages of a redraft are, firstly, that it would allow a thorough examination of the principles and concepts of corporate governance which underpin the law. For example, the relationship between ownership&mdash;that is, shareholders&mdash;and management has changed fundamentally, yet the law has not kept pace with those changes. The second advantage of a redraft is that practical experience gained in the working of the national scheme of corporate regulation could be built on to refine the law: for example, with regard to prospectuses and takeovers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, a review of the contents of the Act may enable some parts of it to be hived off into separate legislation. For example, would the insolvency provisions be better placed in an insolvency Act as they are in other parts of the world? Fourthly, advantage could be taken of developments in legislative drafting to produce a clearer and more accessible piece of legislation. For example, the Office of Parliamentary Counsel has been widely praised for its wholesale revision of the Social Security Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes that this process should take place over a period of perhaps three years to ensure consultation with all interested parties, the States, the business community and the professions. The Committee will fully develop this proposal and table it in Parliament by the end of this session. I stress&mdash;and this is important&mdash;that the Committee is not planning to redraft the corporations law itself. Rather, it is suggesting the development of a proposal for a long, bipartisan, consultative process leading to a thorough redrafting of the law in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to scrutiny of the ASC. As part of its continuing responsibility for scrutiny of the ASC and its associated agencies, the Committee will review their annual reports, hold hearings where necessary and report to the Parliament on any significant matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On institutional shareholders, the Committee is mindful that, with a general election imminent, it is unlikely that a new long term inquiry will be finished in this Parliament. However, the Committee will develop a reference on the emergence of major institutional shareholders, particularly superannuation funds, and their significance for corporate law and corporate regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Issues which will be considered include whether the investor protection role of company law is relevant to these investors, the influence of institutional shareholders on the stock market and the influence of the large institutional shareholder on the governance of a company. The Committee will seek submissions on this reference early in 1993 and prepare the ground for its successor in the next Parliament to complete the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in light of press reports drawing attention to calls by the Business Council of Australia and the Institute of Company Directors for an inquiry into criminal and civil law enforcement by the ASC, I refer honourable senators to the report of the Committee <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Relations between the ASC and the DPP</EMPHASIS> which was tabled last Thursday in this place in which the Committee said at paragraph 1.6 that it would:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . not seek further hearings with the protagonists at this stage. [The Committee] believes that it is important that both organisations be given the opportunity to give effect to the Attorney-General's guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee therefore rejects the calls of the business community as premature and believes that the guidelines established by the Attorney-General should be given a chance to work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;As a member of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, I wish to make some remarks on the statement brought down by the Chairman of that Committee, Senator Beahan. Obviously, from the front page of the major newspapers in Australia this morning, there is a major focus by the business community and the legal fraternity on the matter of corporate governance in Australia. The matters referred to by the Chairman, Senator Beahan, in relation to the Business Council of Australia and other business groups for a major inquiry into the Australian Securities Commission and particularly its pursuit of white collar criminals are matters which have quite properly been responded to by the Chairman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, it is quite timely that we are able to bring down a statement today reflecting the Committee's views. The Committee met last night to consider its program for the next year. Of course, this Committee has quickly attained a high public profile in the Australian political debate. It is fair to say that the Committee has received general support from the business community and the legal fraternity for the very positive work it is doing 90 per cent of the time on a totally non-partisan basis. I can assure the Chairman, Senator Beahan, that the proposed consideration of the process of redrafting the corporations law will certainly receive wholehearted support from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also incumbent upon me to make some statements about the process of how this corporations law came into being. Back 18 months ago when the legislation was rushed through the House of Representatives in one hour and brought through the Senate in an almost ludicrous amount of time, the Opposition, and particularly the Opposition spokesman on corporate law, Peter Costello, made some statements which highlighted our concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, Mr Costello issued a press statement at that time in which he said it was ludicrous to debate a 300-page piece of legislation in less than one hour in the House of Representatives and that there was a devotion of some 12 seconds per page. He said that no proper analysis or scrutiny of the legislation could take place. Of course, the Opposition predicted problems and problems have occurred. Mr Costello said in the last paragraph of that statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Enforcement of high standards of corporate management has been abysmal over the last five years. We hope that this scheme will work. It would work better if the legislation was adequately scrutinised so as to anticipate and prevent any problems from arising in the future. If it lurches from problem to problem that is the fault of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the Government, and the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) in particular, must bear some responsibility for the quite significant problems that the Australian Securities Commission and the new corporate law have had in the first year or so of life. That is not to distract from the positive work that this joint statutory Committee is doing and will continue to do on the reform of this law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The redrafting process is one of the most positive undertakings of this Committee. There is no doubt that in every single public hearing held by our Committee the business community, legal fraternity, academic fraternity, the Chairman himself and all members of the Committee have come to the realisation that the corporations law has become a very complicated and complex piece of legislation which has added to the cost of doing business in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has created an absolute bonanza for corporate lawyers who are paid highly to try to interpret the law. It is crucial for business in Australia, if it is to get on with business without having to work its way through a minefield of laws, regulations, interpretations and court decisions, that there is a simplification of the law. The law should be redrafted in a comprehensible fashion so that the business community can actually deal with corporate law in a sensible environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, at our hearings in Sydney into the close corporations Bill, one of the great factors raised by all of the people who gave evidence was that when the Edwards Committee was investigating such a Bill in 1985 many small business people thought there was not a need for a close corporations Bill. There is an overwhelming demand for a close corporations Bill, a corporate regulatory regime for smaller and medium sized businesses. The corporations law itself has become so complicated and so hard for small entities trying to get on with business. They want to incorporate but are scared off by the complexity of the corporate law. They need a totally separate regime so that they can get on and do business as an incorporated entity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that there is a need for this and that  it is long overdue. As I said earlier, I can assure Senator Beahan and the Parliament that the Opposition will support this process and the quicker we get a sensible corporations law, the better it will be for Australian business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I rise to make a few comments on the statement that was made by the Chairman of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities. I do so as a member of that Committee and on behalf of the Australian Democrats. On behalf of my Party, I wish to state our support for the program the Chairman has outlined. As previous speakers have stated, the Committee is currently coping with a substantial workload, but has shown in its operation that it can contribute substantially to the debate that is currently being carried out in this country about corporate matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I lend support to the project that the Chairman has foreshadowed, which is a complete review and redraft of corporations legislation. It is quite clear, as evidence to the Committee from a host of witnesses indicates, that the corporations law has grown to such an extent, indeed to hundreds and almost thousands of pages, that it is becoming difficult for anyone but the most specialised practitioner to cope with it. There have been numerous instances where even experienced practitioners have had difficulty not only in dealing with a problem but in finding the place in the legislation where a particular issue was being dealt with. The Australian Democrats welcome this program. I think it will be extremely useful and beneficial for the development of corporations law in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to address also some brief remarks to one particular aspect which is included in this review and which has had some public profile in recent weeks, and I refer to the prosecution of white collar crime. While the dispute&mdash;one could call it a demarcation dispute to some extent&mdash;between the Australian Securities Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions has to some extent at least been put to rest by the Attorney-General's statement setting down guidelines and directions for both bodies, I find that one aspect was missing, namely, the provision of additional resources to both of these bodies to catch up with the backlog of prosecutions for white collar crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am somewhat disturbed by calls that have been made by the Opposition which indicate that it feels the Australian Securities Commission should not be concerned with the investigation of white collar crime prior to prosecution at all but should simply be a regulatory body. I would suggest that would mean we would probably have a void in this particular area because there has been an announcement from the NCA and its current Chairman that it is to reduce the priority which was given by the previous Chairman, Mr Justice Phillips, to white collar crime and that the Authority would return to its earlier focus of Mr Justice Phillips's predecessor, Mr Justice Stewart, to drugs and related offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the NCA is turning its back on white collar crime, if the ASC is to be a purely regulatory body, the question must be asked: who is to investigate those people, commonly called the corporate cowboys, who have brought our corporate world into disrepute? I believe the situation put before the Committee by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), and indeed by a range of witnesses, that the ASC should continue its investigatory responsibilities and should then, through agreed guidelines, provide the DPP with sufficient material to prosecute our corporate criminals, is the correct way to go. I also believe, as witnesses have said, that it is clear that corporate criminals fear nothing more than a prison sentence. It is quite ludicrous to suggest that they will be deterred from their crimes by a monetary fine which they would simply view as a business expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing my remarks, I would again suggest that the Government, the Attorney-General more specifically, should give some consideration to providing additional resources to the ASC and to the DPP to bring to a conclusion the prosecutions that are currently under way and to carry out its investigations with increased intensity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I wish to speak to the statement made by the Chairman of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, which is a very important Committee. The Committee, of which Senator Beahan is Chairman, is a very well staffed and very well comprised committee. It deals with the company structure, which is a structure through which very much of our economic life is conducted in this country and indeed in many other countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to get the right balance between proper regulation and giving corporations enough rein to perform their function, which is to produce the wealth to deliver those services and goods that we need for the good of this country. I think everybody understands that there has to be regulation, but latitude has to be allowed to corporations to enable the good that does come to the country through the corporate structure to come in as big a measure as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be worth while to understand how corporations came about.

These people were able to come together through the corporate structure and devote their money to a venture. That venture, if successful, would return them a dividend on their money. Their purchase of that part property in the company was called a share; therefore, they became shareholders. What has become of concern to people, particularly in modern times, is that those shareholders be looked after.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has developed is the separation of the ownership of a company from its control. In the early days of companies, people who owned the company also controlled it and probably carried out the work in it. More and more, the people who own the shares that represent the property in the company have become separate from the company itself with less and less ability, particularly if they are small shareholders, to have any control over how the company is conducted. It is right and proper in those circumstances that the law should come in and protect those shareholders, particularly in public companies. Therefore, we as a legislature have a responsibility to see that they are protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, the protection can become such that the people who have the duty to carry out the proper running of the company are so constrained that they cannot produce the wealth that we need through the companies. This Committee is intent on so arranging the law that there is the ability on the part of the managers, the directors and the managing directors to run the company profitably while at the same time giving the owners&mdash;the shareholders&mdash;reasonable protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chairperson of the Committee, Senator Beahan, mentioned the concept of closed corporations, which is a matter that this Committee is properly devoting itself to. Small business people want to take advantage of not only the limited liability that companies give but also the tax advantages that come with being the employee of a company. The idea behind closed corporations is that it gives a person who is running a small business&mdash;it is often said in this chamber that small business forms very much the basis of our economy&mdash;the ability to so arrange things that he or she in effect becomes an employee, and properly so, of the company. There is nothing illegal or immoral about that. Indeed, it is very much to the advantage of the people who are producing our wealth. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Audit committees are mentioned in this context. It is important to develop that idea and to legislate for it in terms that would promote this concept: companies should have within their structures a committee devoted to auditing the functions that it performs. For example, there would be a finance audit, a production audit and so on. As Senator Beahan has said, the Committee is anxious to have that matter investigated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said that the Committee is on about rewriting the corporations law. I hope that this Committee does not convey the impression that it is rewriting the whole of the law in this area. The present Attorney-General, the Hon. Michael Duffy, has done a lot of very good work in this area. Amongst the very many contributions that he has made to this nation, he has given it a very good piece of legislation in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course it needs to be amended, but certainly it should not be seen as the necessary task of this chamber and this Committee to rewrite corporations law because, simply, it is not a necessity at this time. In my view, substantially, the legislation will serve this community well for many years to come. That does not mean to say that there are not areas&mdash;such as loans to directors&mdash;that cannot be further looked at. Hopefully, some legislation will come down in that area soon. I make it clear that my view is that the legislation we presently have is, in substance, the sort of legislation that we ought to go forward with and that we should have not a rewriting of it but an amending of it&mdash;in the sense that any legislation needs to be amended&mdash;as the need arises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much is made of the issue of plain English. True enough, if plain English leads to an understanding on the part of everybody of what a piece of legislation is all about, let us look at that. But it is too simple to say that a piece of legislation, which has been written in terms of the law as we know it and the common law and precedents set in this area over many decades, should simply be rewritten without any regard to what has gone before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is needed in time is a look at how this legislation is working. If there is a need to amend it after discussion with the corporate sector, the shareholders and the Attorney-General's Department, it should take place, but not otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I should talk about concerns the relationship between the Australian Securities Commission and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the relationship between the Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions should be seen as some sort of conflict between them in fundamental terms. Perhaps there have been some skirmishes on the periphery but fundamentally the relationship is good. It is not a question of whether one or the other should be prosecuting people; it is a question of whether or not the system, which includes both, can give us the sort of corporate sector we want so as to satisfy all needs. That is the real question. We sometimes get ourselves into all sorts of difficulties chasing down a particular path and discussing whether or not A or B should be doing a particular function, whereas the real issue is whether a particular result is being produced by the overall scheme that is in operation. </PARA>

<PARA>Deputy President, I seek to suspend Standing Orders because this matter is clearly urgent. The Government is apparently determined that this document not be put on the public file in this place. The document is in fact, astonishingly, another correction by AQIS of matters that have been of embarrassment to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke on the adjournment last night about the fact that AQIS had to correct an earlier document that referred to prime ministerial discussions in relation to the importation of live pigs. That was clearly stated in a document of AQIS. It was denied by the Government and AQIS subsequently corrected it by saying that it was totally wrong. Mr Landos, a very senior officer in AQIS, said that although he inserted those specific words, he was in error in doing so and he could not explain why he did so. I said on the adjournment last night that I found that quite astonishing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Question Time yesterday we questioned Senator Button about what was apparently a misleading of the Senate in relation to the importation of genetic material from Denmark relating to pigs. Another memorandum said in fact that there had been ministerial discussions in relation to the importation of that genetic material. We asked Senator Button why he was continually denying that that was the case when, on an AQIS document, it was clearly stated to have been the case&mdash;that is, that there had been ministerial discussions in relation to that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button hinted yesterday that perhaps AQIS had got it wrong again. It is fascinating that today, after we had pressed Senator Button on that issue yesterday, there comes to light yet another correcting document of AQIS, this time signed by Mr Gascoine, the Acting Executive Director of AQIS. Seeing that the Government does not want it tabled, I will read it. The document, which is dated 15 October 1992, is to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John Landos, Director of Quarantine Division, provided a briefing note to you and Minister Griffiths on 23 June 1992 under the heading "Importation of Pigmeat and Pig Genetic Material from Denmark".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The note includes a statement to the effect that the Danish Minister for Agriculture (Mr Tournaes), at his discussions with you in April 1992, raised the matter of access to Australia for uncooked Danish pigmeat and pig semen.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This statement was not correct. The recall note on your meeting with the Danish Minister, prepared by an officer of the Corporate Policy Division of the Department, makes no reference to importation of pig genetic material. No AQIS officer attended the meeting with the Danish Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AQIS regrets that this error was made in its advice to you.</PARA>
<PARA>This is absolutely astonishing, Mr Deputy President. This is not the type of issue where there can simply be a slip. It is specifically stated in this AQIS document that the matter was raised by the Danish Minister. It was discussed at ministerial level. How could the officer have put that in this memorandum if it was not correct or if he had not been told that that in fact was the state of affairs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not got any explanation for that. We did not get any explanation for it in relation to the correction&mdash;the so-called correction&mdash;concerning the prime ministerial involvement. We now have no explanation in relation to the correction in relation to the ministerial involvement on the question of importation of semen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are further AQIS documents yet to come which are equally damaging, I would suggest, to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in this matter.

The memorandum says:</PARA>

<PARA>What is this political climate that has to be more favourable before this issue of importation of genetic material can be progressed?  The Government has to give us an explanation as to that rather than seeking to avoid to face up to these issues. </PARA>

We can easily recall the familiar scene of Senator Boswell waddling up here and belatedly trying to correct the record by trying to get the pages that he had forgotten to table, had omitted to table, or had deliberately chosen not to table into the record, to pretend that somehow he wanted the record to be pure and clear. </PARA>

The tabling of one page of a multi-page document simply because that page suited the argument, but leaving the other pages out simply because they do not, is not the whole truth and it is not nothing but the truth.

The difference is that Senator Hill does not like the answer; the difference is that he does not want that answer; and the difference is that that answer does not suit his political purpose.

It is glad news for Australia and Denmark that we deal with one another across a broad range of fronts, not just on the pig issue, and that the Danes raise questions about these discussions as referred.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I answered that question on the night of the inquiry of Estimates Committee F.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who confide in Government Ministers about their commercial interests in the hope that Ministers, acting on behalf of the nation, can advance the matter are entitled to privacy.

Let them tell the business community of Australia, `Never tell a government anything because if you do tell things to government that are confidential and touch your commercial rights, you will have them bruited abroad'. If Opposition members believe commercial-in-confidence matters ought to be publicised, they should say so.

We have had a range of questions tonight from Senator Hill: `What does all this mean?'; `Is this the end of the world?'; `Does this portend doom?'; `What is the significance of this?'. The first thing that ought to be said&mdash;and Senator Hill well knows this&mdash;is that no AQIS officer was present at the meeting between Danish Minister Tornaes and Minister Crean. They were not present. In the notes and material prepared by people who were present, who were privy and who do know, there is no reference to semen or genetic material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, like all big organisations, sometimes makes mistakes. Digby Gascoine, the Acting Executive Director of AQIS, says that this was one of them. This is the most responsible officer in AQIS. The allegation is that what AQIS says is right and what those who were present say happened is wrong. That is the allegation the Opposition is making. AQIS has put out, through its most senior official, a denial that the AQIS reference is factually correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are criticised here because a more junior officer than the most senior officer in AQIS did not put out the note. `Why did Mr Landos not put out the note?', asks Senator Hill.

Because this matter was raised in this chamber, and it is a serious matter, why would one ask a more junior officer to reply?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is proper and responsible for the most senior official available in AQIS to say, on behalf of the organisation, what the case is, and he has said so. He has said so clearly, openly and irrefutably. But that answer which he has written and published is not acceptable to the Opposition. It is not the answer it wants. It does not suit the sleaze that is being engaged in here, it does not suit the slimy manoeuvre that is being engaged in here and it does not suit the effort to blackguard and sling mud that is being engaged in here. Therefore, the credibility and the personality of this officer must be attacked and destroyed.</PARA>

That public servant has no right of equal protection and defence&mdash;none. One of the reasons why people out there in the community hold politicians in low esteem is that they sometimes call places like this, given the use it is now being put to, `cowards castles'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was an astonishing speech by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). The first part of the speech plunged the knife right in between Mr Keating's shoulder blades. Mr Keating says&mdash;and I will read this for the edification of the Senate&mdash;`The joint venture has not been the subject of any ministerial talks'. The Minister spent the first 10 minutes of his speech telling us about the ministerial meeting that Mr Keating said did not happen. Senator Cook just spent 10 minutes saying it did happen. Is Senator Cook misleading the Parliament, or is Mr Keating misleading the people? That is the crux of this argument. Someone is not telling the truth. Something does not smell right in the state of Denmark. Everything that has arisen has had to have a question raised about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first letter we got was from AQIS, which clearly stated that there were ministerial and prime ministerial discussions. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Danes first raised the possibility for access for live pigs in the mid-1980s. This request was not formally followed-up until 1990 when it re-emerged as an issue at Prime Ministerial level . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There was the first mistake. That letter was followed by another letter on 21 July that said that was a mistake; there was a retraction from the original letter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then questioned the officers who wrote that letter. We asked, `How could you make a mistake like that? How could you think that there were prime ministerial discussions if there were not?' In fact, Senator O'Chee said to the officer, `Do you often have visions of grandeur about the Prime Minister?'. We were told that three officers drafted that letter, and none of them could remember how the prime ministerial discussion got in there. That is the first mistake. Today, we are told in a memo that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The note includes a statement to the effect that the Danish Minister for Agriculture (Mr Tornaes), at his discussions with you in April 1992, raised the matter of access to Australia for uncooked Danish pigmeat and pig semen.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This statement was not correct. The recall note on your meeting with the Danish Minister, prepared by an officer of the Corporate Policy Division of the Department, makes no reference to importation of pig genetic material. No AQIS officer attended the meeting with the Danish Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>AQIS then tenders an apology. That document was in response to a freedom of information request I obtained from AQIS. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A joint venture between Danpork (Denmark) and the Australian company Brown and Hatton has recently been announced to establish an integrated industry in Australian based Danish processing technology, Australian pig genetics and, ultimately, with inclusion of Danish pig genetic material if possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Danish Minister for Agriculture raised the matter of access for uncooked Danish pigmeat and pig semen during discussions with Mr Crean in April 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the second mistake, the second retraction. What is going on over there? This note certainly came in after the Estimates Committee hearing where we had asked a number of questions on this issue. Surely, the Department head would have gone through it with a fine toothcomb to find out if it had any mistakes. But no, he did not. The freedom of information answer came to me, I then asked questions on it, and Senator Button denied that there had been any ministerial discussions between two Ministers on the importation of pig meat, semen and genetic material, yet yesterday for the first time after questioning over two or three months Senator Button said that there was a ministerial meeting and that at that ministerial meeting there was no discussion about pigs or genetic material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Senator Button has three times told the Senate there were no ministerial discussions. He then changed that yesterday to say that there were ministerial discussions but that they did not include the topic of genetic material. Today we have been told, despite what I had tabled&mdash;and, sure, I only tabled one page of that because I thought only one page was relevant and it is the only page that was relevant; I tabled the whole five pages yesterday&mdash;that the letter which came in under freedom of information is wrong. So both the first letter, saying that there was prime ministerial intervention, and the second letter are wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are mistakes and there are mistakes. As Senator Cook says, there is no person here who has never made a mistake. But to write a letter and put in that letter that the highest officer, the highest politician, in this land pushed for genetic material being imported and then to say it did not really happen is really extending the realms of possibility to the limit. That is followed up today with another retraction. Today AQIS wrote to Minister Crean stating that the briefing note to Minister Griffiths on 23 June about the ministerial talks on pig meat and pig semen was incorrect. The letter says that the recall note of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy on the ministerial meeting `makes no reference to importation of pig genetic material'. I suppose Senator Button will be able to come in and say, `I did not mislead the Parliament'. I do not know where he is tonight. I told Senator Button today that he had not answered the questions correctly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is just another example of where we have to question the competence of the Department. There are the prime ministerial discussions which did not exist, the ministerial talks which did not take place, and the AQIS briefings to the Minister which were wrong and needed to be corrected. What ministerial briefing papers will be corrected next? Either the Department is inefficient, to say the very least, or it is being pressured into covering up the Prime Minister's business activities. No-one can be as inefficient as this. Whatever the case is, the Prime Minister himself must come into the Parliament and tell us what in the name of goodness is going on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the NBEET report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Minimum Fees for Postgraduate Courses</EMPHASIS>. This NBEET paper is a result of a ministerial direction to the board of NBEET to examine further the issue of minimum fees for postgraduate students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report advises against the setting of a minimum fee for postgraduates. In the 1991 NBEET report on postgraduate fee guidelines it is stated that fees charged for courses will be determined by the institution, subject to a minimum fee being charged which is equal to or greater than double the discounted HECS charge. This advice supports the view that this matter be left to the institutions with minimal government interference, believing that there are in-built restrictions as to the level of fee that can be charged, such as the requirement that institutions return to the government the equivalent of the discounted HECS to each fee paying student within the funded load. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report advocates commission surveys after two or three years to assess the effect of the new arrangements. However, in forging these new arrangements there has been no consultation between the national board and CAPA, the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations, despite the strong opinion of CAPA that the Government impose a minimum fee for postgraduate courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CAPA has consistently argued for the setting of a postgraduate fee that is the equivalent of the discounted HECS charge. I find it surprising that only a small proportion of fee paying students are expected to claim course fees against taxable income and expect that this will increase as more people undertake further education to improve their employability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to CAPA data has shown that more fee paying students than other course work postgraduates change their work commitments, including giving up work, in order to study&mdash;in fact, the figure is 23 per cent compared with 15 per cent; and it is surprising that more are not employed. Consequently their capacity to claim fees as a tax deduction is limited as not all earn sufficient income or pay sufficient tax to lodge a return or claim course fees against their income tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Office deems that self-education expenses can be claimed only if the course is being undertaken for the purposes of improving or maintaining them in their existing profession. However, evidence demonstrates that people enrol in postgraduate programs often to move on to a new job. For these students a HECS debt would be fairer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus, there are many problems and inconsistencies with a fee charging system for postgraduate courses. CAPA has aligned the imposition of fees with an increasingly utilitarian view of education with reports that some students make their course choices on financial grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note what has happened in the area of course fees for postgraduate courses as some research by CAPA has indicated some astonishing results. For example, at Monash University it now costs $20,000 per year to do a masters in business banking. At Monash University an MBA now costs $32,000 per year, which is a vast amount of money for most people. At Melbourne University a masters will cost $31,000 per year and at Macquarie University an MBA will cost $27,750. Of course, at Swinburne Institute an MBA will cost $26,000 per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am making is that these degrees do not come cheaply, and today a press release was issued by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) complaining about the Opposition's fee policy for undergraduate courses. He made an astonishing remark about the Opposition's policy, and that is a separate question which I will not address here. I know that the Opposition understands what my position is on their fee policy for undergraduate students. But the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services had the audacity to actually point out that under the Opposition's policies some degrees could cost as much as $25,000 annually. Yet already under this Government fees for postgraduate courses have skyrocketed and are really beyond the reach of many average Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is our view that Mr Baldwin's statements today have been totally duplicitous as he tries to point out that the Government is driven by equity and has a policy of ensuring that all students have access to higher education. This is clearly not the case in the area of postgraduate courses. The report states that fees can be set to the level which the market can bear, which indicates that we should also look at a maximum fee for postgraduate courses to prevent escalating fees and to remind institutions and the Government alike that the value of postgraduate research is not in the revenue it can raise, but for the skilled graduates it produces. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Board of Employment, Education and Training has presented this report on the commercialisation of research which supports measures to increase collaboration between higher education institutions and industry. This report is an advice to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) commenting on two recent reports into the commercialisation of research.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">NBEET has not blindly accepted the recommendations of this report and has actually offered some very sound advice to the Minister, much along the lines that the coalition will adopt when we are in government. It has been recommended that both the Australian Research Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council set aside 10 per cent of their expenditure for projects which demonstrate commercial commitment by industry. NBEET has quite rightly not supported this proposal, concluding that universities should be free to determine the extent of their links with industry, and acknowledged that in most industries this target level of commitment would already be exceeded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another recommendation was that joint industry and university appointments should be encouraged by the Government. NBEET agrees, and the coalition in its Fightback policy agrees that these links should be encouraged, but it must be emphasised that specific institutional appointments should not be dictated by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been also recommended that a technology transfer and development company should be established to buy and sell intellectual property and to invest in and develop Australian technology. It was encouraging to see that NBEET expressed some reservations about this idea as it truly appears to be more government interference in an area which can be looked after by the universities with minimal guidance from the Government. NBEET quite correctly suggests that such a technology group should be developed to enhance rather than compete with existing successful and effective technology groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, NBEET expresses its strong support for measures to enhance collaboration between higher education institutions and industry and stated that it would be pleased to contribute further to initiatives in promoting commercialisation of Australian research endeavours. This encouragement of the commercialisation of research has long been the policy of the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Substantial government support for research activities is justified by the fact that much research has the character of a public good that is available to us all. There is, nevertheless, the challenge to ensure that this basic research does not take place in such a way that it is isolated from the community in which it occurs. That is why the coalition very strongly believes in encouraging the commercialisation of research, and in Fightback we have introduced the industry higher education research initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this initiative, the Commonwealth Government will provide matching grants of one as to five for industry contracts obtained by university researchers. This money is not to support the contract, which is expected to be fully self-funding, but to provide resources for basic research activities by the host university. These may or may not be relevant to the contract research. The scheme provides a mechanism for allocating additional research funds in a thoroughly decentralised process where the decisions determining the allocation of funds are those of the institutions which will, under Fightback policy, become increasingly responsive to market opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is in stark contrast to the Government's emphasis on centralised research funding. The coalition policy aims to encourage researchers to seek out projects with industry by providing the reward of additional funding for basic research. It will be accessible to all higher education institutions and it will ensure that links with industry are not developed at the expense of the responsibility of the universities for basic research. Up to $25m a year will be allocated to this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The future growth of research in Australia should be through commercialisation. Australian research should be more responsive to market need. This has always been coalition policy and it is good to see that NBEET is moving strongly in this direction. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the Senate is a document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The National Road Safety Strategy</EMPHASIS>. This is a very useful document which has been contributed to by a very large range of organisations from the areas of medicine, transport, police, ambulance, local government and education. The report offers many sensible ideas, principles and objectives. It is unfortunate, however, that this Government&mdash;and, more particularly, the Minister for Land Transport, Mr Brown&mdash;is in reality acting in a contrary direction with a safety problem that it has created on the national highway near his own electorate in the Hunter Valley. I am referring to the planning debacle of the F3 freeway between Sydney and Newcastle and the intention of the Government to let a section of the national highway stop in the middle of a swamp, eight kilometres from the next part of the national highway that it is meant to feed into.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this report, one of the objectives of the strategy, Objective E, is entitled `safer vehicles, safer roads and safer road users'. The concept is to seek coordinated use of best available practices in road safety, introduce safety auditing principles into road design, construction and maintenance, and use traffic management programs to address existing problems such as road hazards and attempt to avoid new ones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the current plans for the F3-Pacific Highway traffic link, it is clear that the Government has given scant regard to the national road safety strategy, particularly this Objective E. The F3 is part of the national road system, Australia's highway around the country, linking the whole country. Unfortunately, the end of the F3 at the moment is the break in that link. Instead of stopping in the middle of a swamp, the F3 is supposed to connect with the New England and Pacific Highways, which are the major link roads between Sydney and Brisbane, but the two northbound lanes of the F3 out of Sydney are going to feed into a single lane of local road called Lenaghans Drive, eight kilometres short of the main intersection of the northern highways. Lenaghans Drive is in a residential area. It has several intersections and a large volume of pedestrian traffic. Clearly it is not a safe option to feed a dual carriageway into such a road. The plan as it stands means that there will be a most horrendous bottleneck of traffic in peak periods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authorities building the F3 are well aware of the fact that this bottleneck will occur. The RTA states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The perception of inadequacy will be heightened for the northbound traffic coming from freeway standards to a relatively short length of two lane road, with entering traffic, before further dual carriageways.</PARA>
<PARA>The relevant authorities know that the result will be a traffic disaster. Why is the Federal Minister, Mr Brown, going to let it occur, especially in light of his new national road safety strategy? Funding is needed urgently to connect the F3 both to the New England and the Pacific Highways with dual carriageways so that traffic can flow smoothly, efficiently, safely and, ultimately, at less cost to private users and to the public purse. Lenaghans Drive is not meant to be part of the national highway. It is regarded as a temporary measure until such time as the final location of the last eight kilometres is decided and constructed, but this could be another 20 years away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Land Transport must act quickly to ensure that the temporary link is replaced as quickly as possible because it is totally inadequate and contrary to the national road safety strategy campaign that he has just released. I commend this report to the Senate, but with the hope that the Government will do something about implementing the strategy effectively, particularly with the broken link to the national highway near Newcastle, which will be of real danger to lives unless the Minister takes urgent action.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Threatened Species Bill 1992, which is a Bill that provides an excellent model for threatened species conservation in Australia. The Democrat Bill has wide support from the community, particularly from environmental groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia needs legislation to protect threatened species as a matter of urgency. Australia has the worst record of mammalian extinction in the world. The figures represent a national tragedy. Twenty mammals have become extinct since European occupation, another 26 are now endangered, and a further 17 are considered vulnerable. Twenty-one birds, including subspecies, have become extinct, 24 are endangered, and 27 are considered vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's record of plant extinction is equally appalling. Ninety-seven species are presumed extinct and just under 1,000 are endangered or vulnerable. These grim statistics appear even worse when comparisons are made with other developed countries. A figure of 12.3 per cent of Australia's vascular plants are deemed to be threatened compared to 0.8 per cent of Canada's plant population and 0.5 per cent of the United States plant population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is not limited to Australia. Species are being lost at an appalling rate around the world. Just the other day, an article appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier Mail</EMPHASIS> about the release of a United Nations study on the destruction of tropical rainforests, where most of the world's biological diversity is to be found. That study reveals that tropical rainforests are being destroyed at the rate of more than one acre per second, a rate that is 50 per cent higher than a decade ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact on biodiversity is devastating. As Dr John Hemming, Director of the Royal Geographic Society, has said recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The planet is losing its biodiversity and we do not know what we are throwing away forever.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is disappearing before we have identified it and we will never know what we have thrown away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is the only developed country in the whole world that is classified as megadiverse. We have an enormous richness of flora and fauna. Many of these species are endemic&mdash;individual and unique to Australia&mdash;and many others remain to be discovered. We have an obligation to future generations, who are entitled to share a planet as rich and diverse as the one which we now inhabit, to conserve species that are threatened with extinction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legislation is essential to conserve threatened species; even the Government recognises that. At the last election, the Australian Labor Party promised to introduce endangered species legislation. I am sure that the Senate is aware that the Government is in the final throes of preparing this legislation. It has been a long time coming. It was to have been introduced during the last session, but it somehow slipped off the legislative program. Now, with an election looming, the Government sees it as a high priority&mdash;or so we are told. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation was to have gone to Cabinet last week for approval. However, the Government went weak at the knees in the face of extraordinary claims made by industry, particularly the mining lobby. We are told in the press that it accused the Government of rushing through the legislation. It said that the Bill of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) cut across the ecologically sustainable development, or ESD, process; that it bypassed the inter-governmental agreement; that it would damage investor confidence; that it would give the Minister for the Environment unprecedented powers; that it was ill-timed and ill-considered; that it would open the floodgates of litigation; and that it would openly encourage third party intervention&mdash;in short, that its draconian elements were of concern to everyone in Australia. That is particularly what the mining lobby convinced the Government was the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sustained and concentrated barrage on what was already a weak Bill, and one that is becoming weaker by the day, is a very cynical attempt by industry to frighten the Government and bring it into line with industry's agenda. Industry groups have shown very clearly that they do not want endangered species legislation. But, thankfully, it appears that the ALP is reluctant to drop the legislation altogether. I say `appears' because we are not sure what is actually going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, the community has shown that it wants the Federal Government to act decisively and to set uniform standards for the protection of plants and animals. Sixty-eight per cent of respondents in the Australian Nationwide Opinion Poll's survey on the environment and the ESD process gave this response: they want the Federal Government to act decisively and to set uniform standards for the protection of plants and animals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government now appears to be paying more attention to the scaremongering by big business than to the real issues of conservation. If we were to allow a compromise to be developed, it would mean a compromise for threatened species legislation. That would end up in a compromise for the protection of threatened species. As I have already mentioned, there is urgent need for that protection to occur without compromise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will look for a moment at one of the claims made by industry that threatened species legislation lies outside the ESD process. That is a claim but nothing could be further from the truth. The former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, in a letter to the three chairs of the working groups in the ESD process, said that one of the four fundamental goals of ESD was the protection of biological diversity and the maintenance of ecological processes and systems. The chairs, in the intersectoral issues report, said that ESD should aim at preventing the further loss of biological diversity. The three chairs recommended that the concept of conserving biodiversity should be integrated into legislation, thereby disproving the claim that this threatened species legislation would be outside the ESD process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Threatened species legislation is an absolute requirement to the achievement of ESD, but to be effective the legislation must ensure that all species are protected, that the community has significant input and that the Minister for the Environment has sole power over certain decisions. In this respect the proposed Bill attributed to Mrs Kelly fails abysmally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contrast between her Bill and Senator Coulter's Bill, which we are now discussing, is stark. Of paramount concern is the extremely limited applicability of the Government's Bill. It purports to relate only to Commonwealth areas and Commonwealth agencies. That is an absurdity. Commonwealth land represents a mere 0.2 per cent of this continent. On the other hand, Senator Coulter's Bill recognises that endangered species protection requires a truly national approach. This Bill applies to every trading corporation and every foreign corporation within paragraph 51(xx) of the Constitution. In other words, this Bill applies to the whole continent&mdash;a far more logical approach to species protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where States enact equivalent threatened species legislation, the Commonwealth would not interfere. However, where a State fails to make sufficient progress on threatened species conservation, the Democrat Bill allows the Commonwealth to take action which would override the States. This measure is absolutely necessary to ensure that species are not sacrificed to State inaction. The Democrat Bill would lead, firstly, to the identification of threatened species across the whole country. I have already indicated how ridiculous it is that we are losing species before we even identify them. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrat Bill would require the preparation and implementation of species recovery plans wherever a threatened species is identified. This systematic approach to species protection would benefit industry, regardless of what it may claim, by improving the information base and thereby providing a greater certainty in decision making. All industries, as I am sure Senator Panizza would agree, require at least a certainty in decision making. Uncertainty is one of the greatest destroyers of business decision making. Industry would know, prior to a development proposal, the location of a threatened species and the conditions attached to development in a particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another stark contrast between the Government's proposed legislation and the Democrat legislation before us is the level of community input. Mrs Kelly's Bill does not propose to allow the public to nominate species or ecological communities for listing. Senator Coulter's Bill recognises that the public has a genuine and rightful interest in nominating species individually, populations or ecological communities for listing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Mrs Kelly's Bill does allow individuals to apply for an injunction in relation to Commonwealth agencies, it does not allow individuals to apply for an injunction from the Federal Court to restrain developers from undertaking an action which would adversely affect a listed species or community. Nor does it allow third parties to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to review decisions made by the Minister in relation to permanent conservation orders or permits to take a species. The Threatened Species Bill, on the other hand, allows for any individual to seek a review by the AAT for any decision made in relation to an impact statement carried out under the Bill. This allows any person, regardless of social status or financial position, to seek a remedy from the AAT on the basis of merit only and not the constraints which would apply if the financial parameters were limited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to last Thursday's ministerial meeting, where the pro-development members of Cabinet successfully pushed through changes that significantly weakened Mrs Kelly's Bill, as has been reported in the press, the Minister for the Environment had a power of veto over actions that would lead to the extension of species by Commonwealth agencies and governmental approvals. Apparently, this power has now been removed. The action Minister is now a development Minister, as designated under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. Once the EIS is completed it is now up to Cabinet to make a decision to approve a proposal and attach conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage we can observe that we can have absolutely no faith in such a procedure. We have been given proof of this recently by no less a person than the member for fast-tracking, Mr Brereton, who, in describing the process for the establishment of a proposed gold mine near Katherine, said that the EIS will be submitted in January and the project will start&mdash;the project `will start'&mdash;in March. In other words, there was no suggestion that the EIS might be inadequate or unacceptable. Regardless of what the EIS might say, the project will proceed. The EIS is therefore just another page to turn; just another box to tick. It has no real opportunity to determine the progress of the project. What is it worth? Absolutely nothing. We can have no faith in such a procedure and no faith in its ability to protect what it is meant to protect. It is useless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's proposed legislation is far from an adequate model for species protection. The potential for economic considerations to dominate in the determination of the outcome of a Cabinet decision is very high. This is what industries wanted. This morning the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper reported that industry groups are still pushing for economic considerations to be included in the listing process. It is absolutely imperative that Cabinet refuses to bend to industry demands on this issue. The Government's Bill would become an absurdity if the listing process included economic caveats, as is being proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How on earth can economic considerations be brought into the actual listing, the identification, of a threatened species? It is either threatened or it is not. Economic considerations are irrelevant. If it is a species which is identified as being reduced in numbers and is threatened, what on earth has any other consideration to do with it? We are talking about a definition of whether something is threatened or not. I cannot understand how economic considerations can impinge on that definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrat Threatened Species Bill ensures that the Minister for the Environment is the action Minister and that that Minister has the right of final determination. That veto power guarantees the effectiveness of the legislation. The veto, of course, would be a last resort option, used only where a threatened species, population or ecological community was being threatened with extinction, and species recovery plans would be inadequate to safeguard survival. I imagine that the use of such a veto would be a rare occurrence and that it would certainly not be a decision made lightly. The opportunity to remove the chance of its being used depends entirely on the species recovery plans which, if suitable, would militate against the necessity of the veto being exercised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other marked differences between the Government's Endangered Species Bill and the Democrat's Threatened Species Bill. For example, assistance to developing countries is accorded much greater importance in the Democrat Bill and the expertise required on the scientific advisory panel is, in the case of the Democrat Bill, clearly defined. But the differences do not rest here. Funding to maintain biological diversity is given a much higher priority by the Democrats than it is by the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the last election the Australian Labor Party promised to give a major increase in funding for a comprehensive biological survey of Australia to be completed by the year 2000. Here, again, the ALP has failed to deliver. The allocation has been increased from $1.1m in 1990 to $1.5m in 1992. It has been estimated that at this rate of funding, the survey will take 1,000 years to complete, by which time we would have lost many species before they are discovered. The Democrats, as part of an integrated budget for species conservation, would increase funding of the survey immediately to $3.5m from the 1992 level. Only when we know the full range of Australian flora and fauna can we be certain how all species can be conserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response in part to an earlier interjection by Senator Panizza, I think it is important that we consider a matter which was presented to the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts when that Committee recently visited the Freshwater Research Institute at Wodonga as part of its inquiry into the management of Australia's water resources. I would imagine that all members of the Senate would consider this inquiry to be of tremendous importance, even if only because of the graphic illustrations late last summer of the incredibly devastating effects that the emergence of blue-green algae in the Murray-Darling river basin was having on the prospects for farming, and even the prospects of living, in the region. The water that was available in certain towns was totally unusable. Even just knowing that should identify this inquiry as being important to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When visiting the Freshwater Research Institute at Wodonga, members of the Committee were shown some zooplankton which were known to be grazers of blue-green algae&mdash;in other words, the little beasties that live in the water and eat up this material that can become toxic in our water courses. We were shown&mdash;and I am sure that Senator Crowley, if she were here, would remember it because it was particularly graphic&mdash;some zooplankton known as rotifers which engage in the process of grazing on blue-green algae. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These little beasties which live in the Australian freshwater system have not been sufficiently identified. Very little is known about their habits, their durability, their capacity to graze on blue-green algae, their breeding patterns, or how long they live. In fact, thousands of them have not been identified. These zooplankton have the capacity to contribute to the ecological balance in such a way that I would suggest there could be a direct financial value placed upon their very survival. If they do not survive, and if that is a cause of the blooming of blue-green algae, the immediate effect will be felt throughout Australia's inland farming communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest, Senator Panizza, that even though we do not know what they are, we know that they are important. They are so important that they are crucial to the survival of Australian agriculture. We are not spending enough money on identifying them. We are not putting enough effort into ensuring that they are identified and that their survival is guaranteed. That is precisely the sort of project and activity which Australians will ignore at their peril. It is precisely that sort of project for which increased funding is proposed under Senator Coulter's Threatened Species Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrat Bill sets the agenda for threatened species legislation. It provides the best possible safeguards for threatened species protection, whilst providing secure mechanisms to compensate any land-holder affected by orders made by the Minister. I challenge the Government to analyse this Bill carefully and to incorporate the key features of the Bill into its own endangered species legislation. It is time to stop the further extinction of Australia's native species. If Australia's shame is its record of extinction, Australia's pride must be its resolve to end the further loss. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The range of this Bill is extraordinarily wide. Its title really is a misnomer, not only because it deals with endangered species but also because it applies to ecological communities, defined as assemblages of flora and fauna that interact as identifiable functional and/or spatial units. We heard already tonight that, yes, it is a very broad Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other definitions are as broad and as vague. For instance, there is no attempt to define `endangered'. This Bill about endangered species does not define what `endangered' is. It does not define what the word `vulnerable' means. The basis for listing in schedules to the legislation species, populations and ecological communities, is to include any of these in a state of decline which is human induced, whether directly or not, and which could potentially result in extinction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This open-ended approach asks us to try to look hundreds of years into the future. It envisages the creation of a range of committees and advisory bodies&mdash;no doubt populated with failed Democrat political candidates&mdash;to implement the proposals. The main such body is the Commonwealth Threatened Species Advisory and Management Committee whose nine members comprise five&mdash;that is a majority&mdash;nominated by conservation groups; one by the Minister; the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service; the Director of the proposed Threatened Species Unit; and a sole&mdash;one, single, solitary&mdash;non-government, non-conservation representative from the National Farmers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no provision whatsoever here or anywhere else for representatives from key industries that would be affected by the Bill, such as forestry or fishing, yet consistently in this place we have the Democrats demanding that conservationists be appointed to boards or authorities where there may well be some kind of impact on conservation. We have once again the double standards, the special pleading, that are the hallmark of Democrat policies&mdash;I cannot even call them populist policies, because they are not all that popular&mdash;desperately seeking to appeal to a narrow edge of the Australian political spectrum. After all, I suppose they really only want to get the support of 14 per cent of the people so they can get a quota in a Senate election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scope of the Bill is simply unacceptably wide. While seeking to encourage the States and Territories to introduce similar legislation, it provides that the Minister may introduce overriding legislation, recommend to the Governor-General that he make regulations which override State or Territory laws and `take any appropriate administrative action'. The Coulter legislation would apply to every Commonwealth agency and would rely on the foreign affairs and corporations power in the Constitution to extend its reach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal, naturally, along with all Democrat proposals, would involve considerable outlays estimated by 1994-95 to be $100m annually for a threatened species program, $24m for an Australian biological resources survey, and $170m for land care. But we need not worry, it will all be paid by the higher taxes that the Australian Democrats want to impose on an Australia already suffering so severely from the combination of taxes and recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is real doubt about the ability of the various bodies to comply with the tasks given them under this legislation, particularly the practicality of making the assessments necessary to determine the status of species or communities. In administering the legislation the Minister is bound to consider only the objects of the Act. No reference is made to any consideration whatsoever of any other impact such as a social or an economic impact. This is one-eyed, one purpose legislation, and that one eye and that one purpose is set on getting the green vote to get back into parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It provides for unlimited third party access to either the Federal Court or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and requires that the Minister must provide legal aid to assist such people. There is one thing this Bill does promise: an area of significant natural growth. That natural growth is a bonanza for the legal profession and has the potential to add major extra delays to approvals processes, adding enormously to the cost and burden to be faced by those industries trying to get Australia out of its economic crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, all appeals, with the exception of those applying to compensate for interim and permanent conservation orders, and matters relating to one other form of agreement, can be based only on the grounds that decisions are not in accordance with the objects of the Act. This would seem to allow the overturning of a decision on the grounds that it was not stringent enough but not if it were excessive or unnecessary for the conservation of a particular species or ecosystem&mdash;an extraordinary situation where, again, there is this one-eyed approach which is simply unreasonable and unfair to the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has published a discussion paper on its own promised endangered species legislation, and there has been considerable discussion on it. I will not go into that at great length at the moment because we will have the opportunity to discuss it at a later stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the Coulter legislation is too broad and too vague and cannot be supported by the coalition. I should mention in concluding that there has obviously been a lot of heartburning in the Government about what the Coulter legislation is trying to do, because the Government is trying to recapture some of the lost Green and far left support that has drifted over to the Democrats which once was a middle-of-the-road party and now is a backtrack party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attempt by Mrs Kelly, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, to take on a veto power was clearly in response to that kind of pressure. It is interesting to see that her ambit claim&mdash;as I think it was called&mdash;in her draft legislation has sensibly been knocked back, I understand, by the Keating Cabinet. That ambit claim would have given her the most extraordinary, incredible power&mdash;almost the sort of power that this Bill is wrongly trying to give to the conservation movement by giving it a majority on the key committee that is part of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note the re-drafting of Mrs Kelly's environment Bill, which was, of course, a trying-to-buy-votes Bill. After a meeting between Prime Minister Keating, Mrs Kelly and industry Ministers, Mrs Kelly's veto power to stop projects if they threatened an endangered species was removed. Now, I understand&mdash;and we have yet to see it, of course&mdash;the revised endangered species legislation to come from the Government will enable Mrs Kelly only to issue an interim conservation order to stop such projects, but Cabinet will have the final say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That may, of course, be exactly what the Democrats want. Greenpeace spokesman Ian Fry said that bowing to business pressure and allowing industry Ministers to decide the future of Australia's endangered wildlife was:</PARA>

<PARA>He said of the legislation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was weak to start with and it's even weaker now.</PARA>
<PARA>No doubt that is why the Democrats are bringing this legislation on now. It was first brought in back in May of this year. Now it is being brought forward because the Government, of course, is coming up with its legislation. This is a clear political attempt to try to drag Green support away from this Government and, of course, to pre-empt those separate Green parties that have indicated that they intend to stand for the next election because they are dissatisfied with the efforts of existing political parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like industry leaders, the coalition was very concerned about Mrs Kelly's veto power, saying that it put investment in Australia at risk and attacked private property rights without compensation.

As has already been pointed out, this is clearly a central part of Senator Coulter's attempt to pick up the Green vote and put the Democrats in the Green position for the next election. This move by Senator Coulter and others in the Democrats has not started just recently. Going back at least 12 months ago, when I was in the company of Senator Spindler in Eastern Europe, he was introducing himself as a member of the Green Party. I took him aside and asked, `Aren't you a Democrat any more?'. He said, `We are attempting to move towards being Green'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I said Senator Spindler. Let him come into this place and deny that he told me those things. That is one of the first reasons that this legislation has come on now: because the Greens were given promises by the Government at the last election, the Government dropped the Greens like the proverbial as soon as the election was over, and the Democrats hope to pick that constituency up now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason it has been brought on now is that they are trying to gazump the Government, which will be bringing in its endangered species legislation any time now.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators would probably know that in the taxation Acts, and various other Acts, there is always a catch-all clause at the end so that, if everything else fails, people can be caught with that clause. Senator Tate would know that because he is a solicitor. That is what the Democrats are attempting to do in this case. As honourable senators have probably noticed in the last couple of months, there are a few mining developments that have gone past, say, the thirteenth report&mdash;Marandoo was the thirteenth and I believe that Yakabindie was the fifteenth report&mdash;and the Western Australian Government, which is about to fall in a couple of months time, has seen the light: that if it wants to get the Western Australian economy going again, it has to start some new developments. So it has let Marandoo and Yakabindie go. Now this Greens-Democrat party here is trying to put this catch-all clause in. Senator Chamarette can laugh as much as she likes. If she knew as much about mining development as I do, or had ever been to a mining development, she would not be smiling so much. That is what the Democrats are intending to do in this Bill. </PARA>

First, one cannot develop a mining site as a resource because of its beauty; secondly, it may be in a national park, or if it is not in a national park, try to make it one; thirdly, it may be a sacred site; and, fourthly, it may have Aboriginal heritage. If an industry can manage to get past those, the Democrats say that there must be a catch-all clause to knock it out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We may as well have a look at Senator Coulter's legislation and see what it is about. As Senator Baume pointed out, the title `Threatened Species Bill' is really a misnomer because the Bill deals with not only endangered species&mdash;and who knows what endangered species are because Senator Bell said that they are not even identified&mdash;but also ecological communities. The legislation defines `ecological community' as:</PARA>

<PARA>Other definitions are broad and vague. There has been no attempt, as Senator Baume said, to define what endangered or vulnerable species are.

Perhaps he could tell us whether he has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am most interested in about this legislation is that it envisages the setting up of more committees.

There was the silicon smelter development by the Barrack Group, now Simcoa. The cost of State delay amounted to $100m. For the Canning Resources project at Hill River, the exploration and feasibility studies cost $30m; the proposed investment was $1.5 billion. That is one-third of the amount that went into the gas project on the North West Shelf. The feasibility studies on the Yakabindie nickel mine have cost $10m to date. Delay costs have not yet been defined, but are probably in the vicinity of $100m. The Beenup mineral sands project was deferred for 12 months with the cost in deferred investment amounting to $135m. These are only some of the projects that are around the place. The list goes on. Nine hundred applications for exploration licences have been stopped or delayed. Of these, 497 were on private land, let alone public land. There are 173 applications on conservation estates and 235 on Aboriginal land or land considered to be environmentally sensitive which are currently delayed. Some applications have been pending for five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total cost in lost investment in Western Australia alone amounts to $2.5 billion. How many jobs would $2.5 billion worth of investment have created? We may not have had the one million unemployed in Australia or, worse still, 1.7 million under-employed. The total annual revenue lost is probably about $1 billion per year. I remind honourable senators that these are the figures for Western Australia alone. That is why this legislation is before us&mdash;to try to stop more and more of these projects. As I said, we are still living off the results of the development of the 1960s and the 1970s. But we are now seeing it going over the hill and on to the horizon. We have to get more developments going if we want to get out of the mess we are in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Baume pointed out, the legislation provides unlimited third party access to either the Federal Court or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It requires that the Minister provide legal aid. That is the bit I like. We are going to have another Aboriginal Legal Service. The only difference is that it will be called the `Green Legal Service'. Some unkind person in my office made a notation in my speech notes that this legislation is going to be a bonanza for the legal profession. I am not a legal profession basher at all. I do not look upon it as a boon for the legal service because it generally has enough to do as it is with all these royal commissions into corrupt governments around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that this legislation is going to be a bonanza for the radicals, educated on the public purse, who will do nothing but rip the public down by stopping projects from going ahead. The legislation will have the potential to add extra delays to the development approval process. As someone has already said, Senator Coulter's legislation is too broad and too vague, and I say it is too stupid as well. </PARA>

I went along to have a look and I thank him for the invitation. I was delighted to look at all the posters and paintings that were on display. The more I see of this legislation and the more I hear of it, the more it leaves me in no doubt that this is one almighty political stunt.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue was summed up to me when I was listening to Senator Panizza's speech. I could hear the snide remarks made by Senator Coulter about Senator Panizza's wealth. Senator Panizza made his money by working hard. He pays his taxes and those taxes go towards paying for social welfare. Do these greenies and conservationists who go around stopping all these projects in Australia pay any taxes to compensate the people who have lost money and who have gone broke because of the things that have happened?</PARA>

The Labor Party down there soon found out what the Greens were all about.

Senator Walsh is no friend of the greenies, as we all know. But he said, `You people in Tasmania are going to have to suffer these greenies and show the rest of Australia just what they're all about'.

<PARA>to the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, we have seen what has happened in Tasmania. I was most concerned to hear Senator Bell say that an important part of Senator Coulter's legislation was to allow the Commonwealth to take action over the States. If ever a State has suffered because of Commonwealth legislation, it is Tasmania. We have had our spy flights; we have had Senator Richardson coming in and overruling the State Government; and we now have the situation with Mrs Kelly and all these environment studies which just go on and on and on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted one article that related back to the days of Helsham where the State had had more than 10 inquiries over the past 15 years. But because the results of those inquiries did not suit the conservationists' agenda, they called for another one. This has happened in even more recent times with the Wesley Vale mill. Inquiries are still going on up there, and the process just goes on and on and on. The conservationists are never satisfied unless the information elicited at an inquiry suits their purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I well remember the day when Senator Walters brought a map into this place showing the areas of Tasmania which had been locked up. Well, more and more areas have been locked up. I do not argue with some of our more important areas being locked up and preserved, but it is now at the stage where they are inventing names and areas. I think the other week Senator Coulter was down at place so called the Tarkine. The Tarkine is Bob Brown's invention; he made up that word and invented that area. It is all supposed to be pristine wilderness when in fact we have the Savage River mine in the middle and the town of Corinna. There are a few areas of forest in there but a lot of agriculture too. Are we going to lock all that up as well? It just goes on and on and on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent effort down there was Bender's quarry at Ida Bay. I remember very well when Senator Bell first raised the matter here. There was a bit of press about it down home, and of course I said, `We're onto a good one here'. That has been continually bashed along. We have now got to the situation where closure of that mine will affect not only the last major industrial producer in Hobart, the Pasminco EZ, but all the local farmers and orchardists who rely on that particular source of limestone. It fits in with the conservationists' method of things. It is not a fertiliser; it is a natural soil conditioner which is essential to increasing production for horticulturalists, orchardists and local major industry in Hobart. But no thought is given to those aspects. It was a good idea at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That area is to be locked up and kept for posterity. I have not yet turned off the lights to check out Senator Bell, even though these caves are supposed to be radioactive. If that is the case following a statement by an eminent scientist that these limestone caves have radiation 800 times above what is considered normal, I think perhaps the industry has been doing people a favour by mining this limestone and putting it to good use rather than locking it up and getting people like Senator Bell radioactive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way this issue has been attacked would make one think that the mining industry in particular is the villain of the piece. Granted in the early days, and even as recently as a couple of decades ago, very little was done about rehabilitation and encouraging reafforestation and the regeneration of native flora and fauna. But I would recommend to Senator Coulter, if he has not already read them, a couple of magazines which were put out by the Mining Industry Council. One cannot fake photographs to the extent that they can been seen in this particular magazine. I think this magazine is a credit to the industry. It sets out in great detail, for instance, rehabilitation after bauxite mining at Weipa. In fact, I hope to have a look at that operation when in a few weeks' time I am up there with the Public Works Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a good article in the magazine about collecting native seed for mine rehabilitation; reconstruction of the wetlands after the mineral sands have been extracted; an article headed `From sands to ducks' about returning life to the Pilbara in an area that was once a waste dump. There certainly has been a big awakening in industry and mining in the area of flora and fauna. But do we really need to use the heavy hand of legislation to ensure that the right thing is being done?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my observation in the four or five years I have been in this place and from my involvement in what was formerly the Select Committee on Animal Welfare and what is now the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs&mdash;and on many occasions Senator Bell has accompanied me&mdash;I believe the fauna of Australia are under much greater threat from feral animals than from mining industries and developers. The fact that the bilby is disappearing from large areas of Australia is not because of mining. It is because of the competition it is getting from feral horses, feral donkeys, foxes and the like. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are putting forward this legislation in order to curry favour with the conservationists and give them power. The Government, and in particular the Minister for Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly), has decided that it cannot let the Democrats have it all to themselves and has brought in its own legislation. Now we have two sets of legislation and, at the end of the day, if the Democrats do not get their legislation through, they will turn around and support the Government's legislation. As a result the Commonwealth Government will ride roughshod over the States and we will return to the position of confrontation that we have come to know so well in this country. </PARA>

They had five years to raise this matter, but after fighting the conservationists and carrying out environmental impact studies which went on for years, they were ready to breathe a sigh of relief and get the scheme moving. It was a nice non-polluting, hydro-electricity producing scheme, but they found so-called sacred sites there.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for giving the chamber an opportunity to conclude discussion of the second reading of this particular Bill. As I was saying, the Government is very strongly committed to taking action to protect endangered species. If this were just a rhetorical flourish, then I guess it could be dismissed, but in fact there is real substance to that claim already. The endangered species program has current spending of $4.3m for this financial year and there is an additional $1.5m allocated for feral animal control, which will assist in the protection of endangered species. I think Senator Calvert was right to emphasise that as a most important strategy&mdash;part of any attempt in Australia to protect our indigenous, endangered species.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Endangered Species Advisory Committee has developed a national strategy which will be used as a basis for development of a national approach by the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council. This is totally in harmony with the intergovernmental agreement on the environment. So I believe that there is already a sound basis and foundation for an acknowledgment of the good faith of the Federal Government in this area of national importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need for legislative action. That can be conceded and, indeed, the Commonwealth is involved in devising such legislation in order to have a statutory foundation for the strategies necessary to ensure the long term survival of Australia's endangered species. There are many objectives of the legislation, but amongst them ought to be emphasised the promoting of the recovery of species and ecological communities that are endangered or vulnerable, preventing other species and ecological communities from becoming endangered, reducing conflicting land management through readily understood mechanisms relating to the conservation of listed species and ecological communities, and providing for public involvement in and public understanding of the conservation of such species and ecological communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, I think Senator Calvert made a very important contribution in emphasising the need for such education to promote public understanding of the need to conserve such species, to enable people to consider, in a less emotional way, the very real vulnerability of some of these species and ecological communities and to acknowledge that there will be occasions when economic development cannot be the idol which takes as its sacrifice these particular species. Of course, there will be a need to encourage cooperative management for the conservation of such species and ecological communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cooperative approach will be the underlying theme of the Federal Government's legislation when it is brought before the Parliament. The Government believes that that will be a more balanced Bill. There is a common objective, but we do not believe that the Democrats' Bill will actually achieve this in a lasting way, in a way which engenders the full cooperation of all those constituents of the Australian community who have an interest&mdash;from individuals to those who may be interested in the development of a particular project, those who have a particular concern for the protection of an endangered species, or the local authorities and State governments in whose jurisdictions strategies will have to be put into place and whose cooperation will be absolutely vital. All of these persons and bodies have a real interest which we believe ought to be harnessed to meet the desired objective in a cooperative rather than in a punitive, antagonistic and adversarial way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the legislation which the Federal Government is developing will commend itself to the Parliament in a way which this legislation cannot.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;Let me begin where Senator Tate has just left off because it seems from what I have heard tonight that there has been quite a lot of confusion about both the contents of this Bill and the processes which have got it to this stage. Senator Tate has just charged that the Threatened Species Bill is not one which has resulted from or will engender a great degree of cooperation and consultation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill was first drafted last year, and it was introduced into this Senate as a draft Bill in September of last year so that not only honourable senators but also people more widely in the community could have a look at this legislation, make criticism of it and, as a consequence of that, allow the draft legislation to be amended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That draft legislation was sent out to over 2,000 groups, and not just conservation groups, let me remind Senator Panizza and others, but to mining interests, forestry interests and farming interests. It was distributed very widely in the community, as a result of which submissions were made about suggested amendments. Those suggested amendments were taken up specifically in that the NFF was included on the committee to which Senator Panizza referred and compensation would be payable should land need to be acquired or should the use to which land can be put need to be changed to defend a threatened species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation envisages far wider cooperation than we have seen in the Government's draft legislation in that the community is able to submit the names of species for inclusion on threatened species lists. This is something the draft of the Government's legislation does not allow for. Of course, a submission to that effect would not necessarily include the species on the list. The Scientific Advisory Committee would then review those suggestions to see whether they should be included. Quite contrary to what both the Government and the Opposition have maintained, a long history of consultation has gone into the preparation and the presentation of this Bill to the Senate and the Bill envisages a continuation of that consultation and cooperation in the operation of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tate indicated that the Bill is confrontationist with respect to the States. It is exactly similar to legislation which is frequently passed in this place at the instigation of the Government, in that it places a backstop behind the States if the States refuse to pass adequate legislation to protect threatened species or, having passed legislation, fail to activate that legislation to defend the species which are under their control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would hope that all of the States would pass adequate legislation, and then this legislation would not be necessary, except in so far as this legislation does allow the Commonwealth to give assistance to threatened species overseas&mdash;because we have experts in this country who can assist in that capacity&mdash;and the powers of the Commonwealth extend, through the external affairs powers, in ways the powers of the States do not. So there is a complementarity of the powers of the Government which would be granted under this legislation and the powers of the States which we do not find in the draft of the Government's own legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been charged by Senator Panizza and Senator Baume that this legislation would result in confrontation with industry. This legislation is designed to avoid precisely that sort of confrontation. We have seen&mdash;I would have to agree with Senator Panizza in this respect&mdash;in many decades recently occasions when considerable sums of money have been expended on plans to develop various things, whether they be forestry, mining or urban developments, perhaps EISs prepared, various studies done, and somewhere down the track a concern is raised on conservation grounds, as a consequence of which there is a Mexican stand-off; there is an argument which perhaps gets into the courts or which perhaps gets before a committee. The stand-off takes a long time to resolve and is never resolved to anybody's satisfaction. Either the proposal does not proceed and perhaps millions of dollars are wasted or the proposal does proceed and environmental damage that might have been avoided is caused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is designed to put in place a series of management plans which would avoid that. So those who would want to mine, conduct forestry or carry out some other development in an area would know beforehand, for example, that they can go into area A, they cannot go into area B or they can go into area C under certain specified conditions. Surely that is a far more productive way of approaching the proper sustainable development of this country. That is exactly what this legislation is designed to do. Quite the reverse of what Senator Panizza and Senator Baume were arguing, this legislation is designed specifically to avoid those very problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to hear Senator Calvert quote P.P. McGuinness, who is a marvellous expert on the environment, my gosh! It was interesting that he quoted him as saying that the environmentalists should pay the foresters if they stop them chopping down the trees. Senator Calvert should jolly well know that, with the exception of South Australia, every forestry commission in this country has run up enormous debts running into billions of dollars. In his own State of Tasmania, the Forestry Commission ran up a debt of $400m, which was written off by the Field Government. The community at large has paid the price very dearly for the foresters. It has been subsidising the foresters to go in and chop down the trees. So it is a pity that neither P.P. McGuinness nor Senator Calvert knows the facts in relation to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also refer Senator Calvert to the Public Accounts Committee in New South Wales, which identified the billions of dollars of debt which had been run up by the State Forestry Commission due to the fact that it had never properly charged for the infrastructure of roads and various other things. I also remind him that my State of South Australia is the only State which has a forestry operation that is not in debt. Because we chopped down all our forests so many years ago, the forestry is entirely based on plantations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Calvert also pointed to the rehabilitation which is being carried out by mining companies. He said that he had a photograph of the rehabilitation of Weipa in front of him. I have been to Weipa and seen the rehabilitation, and I have been with the Aboriginal people who have been there collecting the seeds. The fact remains that the company there can rehabilitate the ground cover and the middle storey extremely well. But after the bauxite has been removed and the top soil is put back without that bauxite layer, none of the tall trees grow back. So the ecology after mining is totally different. Sure, the mining companies can get some cover on there, but they do not get back what was there before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to sandmining in Senator Panizza's own State, the fact remains that if 10 per cent of the species of plants can be put back into a sand mined area, that is regarded as adequate rehabilitation of the area. To the untrained eye&mdash;and I hate to reflect on Senator Calvert's botanical ability&mdash;that might look very good. It might make a very nice photograph, but it is not returning the area to the state that it was in or returning the indigenous species to where they once were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Calvert made the point that the mining companies are behaving better. That is certainly true; they are behaving a lot better than they were 20 years or 30 years ago. But why are they behaving better? They are behaving better precisely because the conservation movement has been very active in pointing to their very poor record in the past. Thank goodness they are behaving better and that we now have some better restitution than we had in former times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to what we are talking about here, which is building an essential element in the plank towards a sustainable civilisation in this country. It is an approach, an attitude and a change to which the Government itself has assented. Under Prime Minister Hawke, the Government set up nine ESD committees to attempt to define the way in which this country might move forward towards sustainability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does that mean? The International Union for the Conservation of Nature has said that we need to adopt these principles for sustainable living:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An ethic based on respect and care for each other and the Earth is the foundation for sustainable living. Development ought not to be at the expense of other groups or later generations, nor threaten the survival of other species.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits and costs of resource use and environmental conservation should be shared fairly among different communities . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, it is referring there not just to human communities but to the wider community&mdash;the living community. The IUCN continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">among people who are poor and those who are affluent and between our generation and those who will come after us.</PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the significant points of conflict which has now arisen over the Government's own legislation. The emphasis by the so-called development interests are on the demands of this generation at the expense of the future. The conservation movement is saying that we must emphasise more strongly the rights and demands which future generations have on the resources of this planet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IUCN also points to the need for change in personal attitudes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To adopt the ethic for living sustainably, people must re-examine their values and alter their behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA>We are indeed in a period of very significant cultural change. As some authors have suggested, we are in a change no less profound than that which marked the agricultural revolution of 10,000 years ago or the industrial revolution of two centuries ago. We need to change yet again and adopt different values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IUCN says that we need to adopt an ethic for living sustainably. People must re-examine their values and alter their behaviour. There is little sign of that in what we have heard from the Opposition tonight. The organisation continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Society must promote values that support the ethic and discourage those that are incompatible with the sustainable way of life. Information must be disseminated through formal and informal education so that needed actions are widely understood.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The IUCN goes on to define what it means by ecological sustainability. Again, I stress that this is something to which the Government has paid a considerable amount of attention and on which it has expended a great deal of money. The IUCN says of ecological sustainability:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A society is ecologically sustainable when it:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">keeps within the carrying capacity of supporting ecosystems.</PARA>
<PARA>As long as seven years ago, the Government made a promise that it would introduce legislation to protect threatened species. At each election we have heard that promise repeated. The Government has simply failed to deliver. In 1990, it made a very specific promise to the conservation groups when, in answer to a questionnaire which was put together by the ACF and several other national conservation groups, it specifically said that it would introduce legislation into Parliament during this term and invoke the use of the corporations power to ensure that there was comprehensive national legislation which had teeth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition objects to the use of section 51(xx) of the Constitution, but we should note that it is very willing&mdash;this is on the record repeatedly in recent weeks&mdash;to use that corporations power to screw the workers of this country as hard as it possibly can to the boards. It has specifically said it will use that corporations power in relation to industrial relations. It is not that it is not prepared to exercise that Federal power, that power in the Constitution&mdash;it is prepared to use it for economic ends&mdash;but it is not prepared to use it to protect the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in Australia live in a continent which for 40 to 50 million years has been floating across the Southern Ocean developing an absolutely unique flora and fauna. We have a responsibility in Australia to ensure that that unique flora and fauna is there not just for our own use and enjoyment, not just for the use and enjoyment of our children, grandchildren and succeeding generations of Australians and not just for the enjoyment of people in other countries in later generations, but that that unique collection of animals and plants will be able to go on evolving and remaining in a biologically intact state into the indefinite future for its own sake. Nigel Calder, who at one time was the Editor of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Scientist</EMPHASIS>, a very respected scientific journal, said of conservation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the primary aim is to sustain diverse and active living communities, in which non-human life can resume in comparative tranquillity the ponderous process of evolution which has been so disrupted and confused by the irruption of man.</PARA>
<PARA>That lies at the essence of the new ethic. It contrasted very markedly with what we heard from the Opposition tonight. We have an absolutely disastrous record in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Calvert mentioned the bilby. If we look at the record, we find that the author of that very well-respected tome, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mammals of South Australia</EMPHASIS>, which was published in 1923, said that 30 years ago&mdash;in other words, he was referring to roughly 100 years before today&mdash;rabbit trappers in the Adelaide hills were catching more bilbies than they were catching rabbits. If I go into a classroom today anywhere in this country and show children a photograph of a bilby, they do not know what a bilby is. Most Australian adults do not know what a bilby is. We have an absolutely atrocious record. We have the worst record in the world when it comes to extinction of species. We have lost large numbers of species and the rate at which we are losing species is in no sense declining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with Senator Calvert: it is not just things such as land clearance and so on which have threatened species of animals; the introduction of feral animals has played a very significant part. The control of those feral animals&mdash;the feral cats which are destroying the bilby populations&mdash;must be an essential part of the process of preserving those species into the indefinite future. My legislation makes no prejudgment whatsoever about what protective measures would be put in place. That is left, as it should be, with the scientific committee to advise on and with the management committee to recommend to government the appropriate processes to use. It might be that it involves going out and shooting feral donkeys, horses or cats, as the Army did in south-west Queensland recently. That might be the best method of doing it. In other cases it might be fencing. In other cases it might be protecting whole areas. It might mean a whole lot of things. It might mean, in an extreme case, bringing animals in and having protective breeding programs before they can be reintroduced into the wild. Those things are all on the possible list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before we even get to that point, we need to very significantly increase the rate at which we are carrying out the biological survey. Senator Bell has indicated that at the rate at which we are currently carrying out the survey, it is likely to be the year 3000 before we even know what we have in this country. For the Opposition to guffaw and joke at the suggestion that we need to spend more money to find out what we have here, I find quite despicable. We are the custodians of these animals and plants. Nobody else can look after them. They will be gone if they disappear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a responsibility. We are taking the wealth out of this country. We have a responsibility to put some of that wealth back into finding out what is here and properly looking after it. One of the first requirements is to substantially increase the rate of that survey so at least we will know what we are trying to look after. We need to know something about the relationships&mdash;that is what the word `ecology' is about&mdash;between the animals and plants so that we know better how to protect them. We are quite incapable of protecting an isolated species. We need to protect whole ecologies. I found it quite depressing to hear Senator Panizza go on in the way that he did, indicating that he has little knowledge of the biological processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly true that we have been running a very active campaign in the Democrats to encourage support for this legislation. In the last few days we have presented petitions signed by over 4,000 Australians, including about 450 individual letters which I tabled today. There is widespread concern for threatened species. As Senator Bell said, in the recent survey for which the Australian taxpayer paid a quarter of a million dollars&mdash;the survey conducted by the Minister&mdash;68 per cent of Australians expressed great concern about threatened species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were fortunate in having a large number of very prominent Australian painters present to us a collection of paintings on threatened species so that we could run an art exhibition around Australia. I would like to put on the record our appreciation of Shane Pickett, Michael Leunig, Neville Weston, Ken Done, Julie Vivas, and Tjyllyungoo, and of Brett Whiteley, who unfortunately died after the exhibition was mounted. That exhibition went to every capital city in Australia. It was seen by many thousands of people. Senator Calvert was at the launch of that exhibition in Hobart. That exhibition has done a great deal to raise the awareness of Australians about the plight of our threatened species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make one point that I should have made earlier in relation to mining, because that seems to be a particular concern of Senator Panizza's. Mining of itself does not create wealth. I repeat: mining of itself does not create wealth. Senator Panizza will know, as a very wealthy businessman, that if he owns a truck or a bulldozer and he sells the truck or the bulldozer he does not become more wealthy. He simply shows in his accounts that he has shifted a capital amount from the capital account to the cash flow account. That is exactly what we are doing when we are mining and sending our minerals overseas without value adding. There is little advantage to Australia in the long run in a sustainable sense for mining iron ore in the Pilbara, as Senator Panizza mentioned last night. The value of that operation to Australians comes from carrying out that operation and then value adding. It is in the value adding that we add real wealth to this country. That is why I have strongly supported the proposal which Compact Steel in Western Australia is trying to promote, precisely because it is a very good value adding project. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I can only repeat that this legislation, unlike the Government's legislation, is comprehensive and national. It has involved a great deal of consultation. The processes which the legislation envisages are ongoing in the area of consultation. The legislation involves the public generally. It does precisely what the Government has promised to do. In view of the promise that the Government made to electors in 1990, I am very disappointed to learn that it cannot find it within itself to support this legislation. This is exactly what it promised it would do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to address a matter of serious public concern which I regard as having assumed the proportions of a first-class scandal. I refer to the activities of one Mr Fred Gazal and the former employees of Caldaden Pty Ltd and Zallag Holdings within the textiles, clothing and footwear industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the events earlier today when over 100 unemployed textile workers came to Canberra along with representation from their union&mdash;with Anna Booth, the General Secretary of the TCF union, and Kevin Boyd, the New South Wales Secretary of the union&mdash;to put their case to the Government. These are people who have seen the factories which employed them close in circumstances which can only give rise to concern. They have been cheated of all their entitlements relating to leave, superannuation, redundancy payments and the like. In total, some 200 workers have been cheated of the best part of $800,000 in entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A campaign is being waged not only by the TCF union but also by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Labour Council of New South Wales, the parliamentary Labor Party in New South Wales, and now I believe the Federal parliamentary Labor Party and, I hope, after this address tonight, by the Parliament. The circumstances are that we have seen paper shuffling on a scale not witnessed since the bottom of the harbour scandals of the late 1970s and early 1980s. In one case, the Caldaden shuffle, in another case, the Midford shuffle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the Caldaden shuffle, beginning with Ideal Products, the company passed through Gazal Industries, Crystal Clothing International to Kent Productions. We see F.S. Gazal Pty Ltd enter, and the company ends at the point of Caldaden Pty Ltd. I will make a point about those transactions in a moment after I have referred to the Midford shuffle beginning with Midford Paramount, passing through Gazal Apparel to Zallag Holdings and again to one Mr Fred Gazal. In this circumstance also, as with the Caldaden shuffle, the Midford shuffle produces the extraordinary result by which the assets go off in one direction and the obligations to the employees in another direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this chamber is aware, the bottom of the harbour scandals of the 1980s resulted in the Commonwealth being defrauded, cheated and denuded of revenue to which the Commonwealth had an entitlement. The Midford shuffle and the Caldaden shuffle result in the employees being defrauded and cheated of their entitlements. We are talking about ordinary working Australians, some of whom have given more than two decades of dedicated service to their employers, working in the textile industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw today the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Peter Cook, and Parliamentary Secretary Peter Duncan, speak directly with the union and the unionists. It was a first-class dialogue and it was needed to draw the attention of the Government directly to this problem. Minister Cook made it clear that he had discussed this matter with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) personally, he viewed it so seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that the response of the Government will be both appropriate and effective in terms of a review of the Crown's priority in matters of tax and a review of the corporations law, and in terms of making certain that the Australian Securities Commission and other appropriate agencies, including the relevant law enforcement agencies, look at the events surrounding the closures of these companies, one of which also, curiously, had a fire at one point involving a substantial insurance pay-out to Mr Fred Gazal. The pay-out is now nowhere to be located. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Government response will be very timely. Mr Duncan made it clear that he was looking to a decision on some complicated matters of law prior to the end of the year. I know that Minister Cook wants to see action taken even more urgently on the industrial relations questions. Of course, one of the issues that needs to be looked at is the whereabouts of Mr Fred Gazal, now believed to be located in Lebanon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What also needs to be determined, of course, is just where all the money has gone&mdash;money which supposedly was set aside to cover workers' entitlements such as long service leave, superannuation and the like. This was money which was supposedly set aside in order to provide for just this kind of eventuality with the respective companies going out of business. Of course, there is also the question of the insurance payout related to the fire which affected Caldaden in 1990. One thing that we can say with absolute certainty is that the workers have not seen that money. In some cases workers are owed in excess of $10,000 for years and years of faithful service. No-one has suggested that they have been at fault in any way. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BS4">Senator LOOSLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Individuals are owed in excess of $10,000. That is conceded. There is a track record involved here, as Senator Bell knows. There is an incident involving a Tasmanian company which may well be related to these kinds of circumstances. Certainly, we can say, again without fear of contradiction, that the common point in the beginning of these matters is the Gazal corporation's purchase of companies. Other matters seem to flow in ensuing years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a grave injustice done to 200 working Australians. I have no doubt that every senator would share my concern and that the Parliament would share my concern. Certainly, the trade unions have waged a campaign of vigour and determination. But I think that it goes beyond that. I have no doubt that every Australian, including people in the business community, would be outraged at the behaviour of Mr Fred Gazal, now somewhere in Lebanon. The injustice and the disservice done to working people really needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. It can certainly never be allowed to recur. We really need to change the law as a matter of urgency to make certain that this kind of shuffle cannot result in this manner of theft again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A number of questions need to be answered.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">WHERE'S THE MONEY FREDDIE?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SOME QUESTIONS THAT DEMAND ANSWERS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACTU; the Labor Council of NSW; the Textile, Footwear and Clothing Union; and the Labor Opposition in State Parliament have all called for the Caldaden and Zallag cases to be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Australian Securities Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many unanswered questions that can only be resolved by formal investigations into these company closures and the behaviour of the companies' Directors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of these questions go beyond `Where's the money, Freddie?', however in the course of trying to recover the outstanding entitlements for their members it has become obvious to the Textile, Footwear and Clothing Union that there were other important issues worthy of urgent investigation. The Union is preparing a full dossier which will be submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Australian Securities Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1987-88 onwards the workers were employed by Caldaden Pty Ltd, a company in which Freddie Gazal is a Director and major shareholder.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears that Caldaden Pty Ltd was a company with very considerable liabilities but few, if any, assets. For example, Caldaden Pty Ltd was supposed to provide workers compensation cover for the Kingsford workers, but it would appear that the company did not keep up-to-date in paying the premiums.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question: Did Freddie Gazal's company, Caldaden Pty Ltd, provide workers compensation cover for its Kingsford workers as required by law?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1988, another of Freddie's companies, F. S. Gazal Pty Ltd, had taken over the lease of the Kingsford factory site. F. S. Gazal Pty Ltd was established in September 1975 as a clothing manufacturer; the two shareholders were Freddie and Hyatt Gazal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">F. S. Gazal Pty Ltd is Freddie's family company. In the past it has made large unsecured loans to Freddie and his family. At one time Freddie and his wife were loaned more than $170,000 by F. S. Gazal Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question: Where did the money come from to pay for Freddie's house in Bellevue Hill?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears that all the business's valuable assets were transferred into F. S. Gazal Pty Ltd, Freddie's family company. Those assets are likely to have included the stock, the machinery and the insurance policy covering the businesses that eventually ended up being based at St Peters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1990 the workers were transferred from Kingsford to St Peters and shortly afterwards fire burnt down the factory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question: Exactly when were all the company records damaged by fire and how many times were they burnt?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time of the fire the land and buildings at the St Peters site were owned by Londonaire Pty Ltd., a company whose shares were owned by Freddie, his wife Hayat Gazal and the family company F. S. Gazal Pty Ltd. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were paid out by insurance companies to compensate for the fire damage to the building.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question: What happened to the fire damage insurance pay-out?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The insurance policies which were paid out included a component to cover the workers' legal entitlements such as redundancy pay and long service leave. Freddie Gazal or any of his companies have never paid the workers any of the termination entitlements to which they are legally entitled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question: Where's the money for the workers' termination entitlements?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Zallag Holdings Pty Ltd, another of Freddie Gazal's companies, also failed to pay termination entitlements to 75 Wollongong clothing workers sacked in July 1992. These workers are still owed more than $220,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However other money remains unaccounted for by Zallag Holdings. Many workers had payroll deductions for a local charity and health funds. Those deductions never reached their destinations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question: What happened to the workers' money deducted for local charity and their health funds?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the months before Zallag Holdings closed its Unanderra factory various machines were sold. It appears that some of these transactions happened at night or at the weekend.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question: Where are the records of those machinery sales?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many important questions remain unanswered in the chequered history of F. S. Gazal Pty Ltd, Caldaden Pty Ltd, Londonaire Pty Ltd and Zallag Holdings. It is difficult to ascertain:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Which companies owned which assets and at which times?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the workers were transferred from one business to another did any other assets go with them?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only full investigations by the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Australian Securities Commission can resolve these matters.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BS4">Senator LOOSLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I conclude by asking these very specific questions. Why should Fred Gazal live in luxurious circumstances in Bellevue Hill and elsewhere when his workers have been the victims of fraud? Where did the money finish and with whom? When will Mr Fred Gazal face his former employees and explain to them precisely what happened? When will restitution be made to the former employees of Caldaden and of Zallag? When will justice be done for them? As a final note, why did this scandal appear to begin&mdash;in both the circumstances I have mentioned tonight&mdash;with the purchase of companies by the Gazal corporation?</PARA></TALK.START>
