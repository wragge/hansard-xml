<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Is it part of the Prime Minister's One Nation policy that we tug the forelock in Asia and apologise for our Constitution, our flag and our values?  What does the Government believe it will achieve in Mr Keating demeaning our heritage and in demonstrating his prejudices in terms of the Australian identity and abandoning the right to take account of human rights behaviour in disbursing Australian taxpayers' money as aid?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1629" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister has nothing at all to apologise for for the way in which he conducted himself on behalf of the Australian Government and the Australian nation when he was overseas. His trip was an admirably successful one and demonstrated in a very dignified and very effective way the kind of contribution that Australia can be expected to make to the region in the future as, indeed, it has done in recent years. It did a great deal to cement the bilateral relationships between Australia and Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. From all the feedback that I have had, that was exactly the way in which the trip was regarded by all the key people in those countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question of diminishing Australia's stature by raising, as Mr Keating did, the question of Australia's identity in the region. This is an issue that many Australian Ministers, including myself, have raised on a number of occasions in a number of forums right around the Asian region because it is crucial to our future&mdash;one directed towards securing effective engagement with Asia&mdash;that we both perceive ourselves to be part of this region and we be perceived by others to be part of this region. It is an entirely legitimate issue to raise in that particular context of how we present ourselves to the region and what kind of identity and what kind of image we present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a matter of washing dirty domestic political linen in an overseas context, which is something for which the Opposition parties were absolutely notorious when in government. It was not a matter of Mr Keating doing anything as crude as Dr Hewson in Papua New Guinea&mdash;formally presenting an Australian flag to Mr Namaliu with an accompanying comment that he was not going to be doing anything thereby to diminish Australian authority and responsibility. That was a crude and undignified incursion of squalid domestic politics into an international sphere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Mr Keating did was raise the issue a couple of times quietly in his discussion with officials. He did not raise the issue of the flag publicly, except in answer to a question at a forum of people in Indonesia when, in response to a specific question, he gave a specific and frank answer&mdash;no different to the kind of answer that he has given on a dozen occasions on this issue in Australia. There was nothing new in what he said. That answer was greeted with fascinated attention by his audience and, indeed, a storm of applause when he had completed it. He made the point very effectively indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of aid and human rights, we had a pathetic attempt a little while ago by the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, to try to carve out some separate high moral ground distinct from the Australian Government by suggesting that so far as the Opposition was concerned human rights should be the fundamental criterion which applied in determining whether aid was directed to particular countries. When we look at his text further, it becomes absolutely apparent that Dr Hewson's position on this issue is no different from that of the Australia Government, which is that this issue about the conditionality of aid needs to be treated on a case by case basis, having regard to the nature of the human rights incursions that are involved and whether or not they represent a deliberate act of the executive government concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very obvious difference, for example, between the Tiananmen situation, which was a deliberate act of state policy which justified a withdrawal of Australian aid; the situation in Burma, which represents, again, a deliberate act of state policy at the highest levels and which again justified a withdrawal of aid; and the situation of the Dili massacre last November which on nobody's analysis involved a deliberate act of high state policy directed from Jakarta. That is the kind of case by case judgment we make. There are many other examples that one can offer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course it is the case that in other aspects of aid delivery we do take human rights questions very closely into account. In the design and the construction of particular programs and projects we take human rights issues, like the role of women, into account in the formulation of policy. We take very much into account the effectiveness of aid in aiding and abetting the victims of human rights discrimination in the way in which aid is delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there are many ways in which human rights principles, foreign policy and the policy of aid do intersect. It is just a squalid, politically motivated nonsense to claim that there is some significant difference in the way in which the Government and Opposition respectively approach these issues. So, if the Opposition were a little bit more honest and a little bit more consistent about these matters, it would have a lot more credibility in the eyes of the community of Australia than it does at the moment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a supplementary question.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a matter of anybody apologising to anyone about anything. It is a matter of making the point that we would better project ourselves, arguably, were we to present a different set of images to the world than a set of images that are directly and immediately associated with our colonial past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I say that from my own experience of many discussions on these sorts of issues around the region, both in years past and more recently since this issue has been raised, I am in no doubt whatsoever of the absolute accuracy of Mr Keating's perceptions about the utility of such a change in terms of the way in which we would be regarded around the region. It is not a matter of anyone, in the absence of the issue being raised, having any particularly strong views about it. But it is certainly a matter of people responding very favourably, very warmly, very positively and very understandingly to the kind of policy change that Mr Keating is suggesting, which may present to the region a very different face of Australia from that which we have had in the past with assistance from the forelock tugging grovellers who are lined up opposite.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. Is the Minister aware of concerns raised at yesterday's annual general meeting of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries about the threat to Australia's car industry from second-hand Japanese imports? Is the Minister aware of figures showing a dramatic fall in new vehicle registrations in New Zealand as a result of imported second-hand cars from Japan?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I made an announcement to the Senate about this matter on 3 December last year. Since that time there has been some lobbying about the issue. Let me set the matter in its proper perspective. Senator Foreman has asked me about the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries. The Federal Chamber did meet here in Canberra yesterday. I met with it, together with the Treasurer. I think four Opposition spokesmen, including Dr Hewson, also met with the Federal Chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chamber and the industry are united in the view that imported second-hand cars threaten the future of the automotive industry in this country. The crucial question about the automotive industry in this country relates to the issue of tariffs generally. The Government's policy, which was announced in March 1991, was based on a report of the Industry Commission after a complete inquiry which recommended phasing down to a 15 per cent tariff by the year 2000. It is only the Opposition that sees fit to depart from a recommendation of the Industry Commission in respect of this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Chamber is also aware of the Opposition's blind allegiance to the dogma of zero tariffs and the fact that it would spell an end to car manufacturing in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has to ask itself that question; we will come to that in a minute. The Opposition claims that zero tariffs will not be a problem because Dr Hewson will wave a set of magic wands and wipe out the structural impediments to international competitiveness overnight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston has been vocal about Mr Jac Nasser, the President of Ford. Mr Nasser has to live in the real world and he says that that is plain wrong. He told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Business</EMPHASIS> magazine this month that the car manufacturers would still be uncompetitive if Dr Hewson could fix all the things that are within this country's control. The supplementary question about that is `Why?'. The answer to that question is that automotive industries around the world depend on volume and we do not have sufficient volumes in this country to have a fully competitive automotive industry. We may get there, but we are not there yet. That is something which I think the Opposition ought to take account of. The Opposition has to find its model for this zero tariff proposal somewhere and it cannot find it anywhere in the manufacturing world in respect of automotive manufacturers. The Opposition is a special breed all of its own.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Alston is a special case all right. We know where he ought to be: in a straightjacket. Dr Hewson will have nothing of the real world. Speaking on television, he said that zero tariffs would lead to a bigger and more dynamic car industry. That is a statement which emanates probably from some academic tutorial room and has nothing to do with the real world. The Opposition's views on these subjects come from an academic tutorial room or from a woolshed economics book in the hands of somebody like Ian McLachlan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if the Opposition's policy would lead to a bigger car industry, it would not be in Australia: it would be in some other country. The reason for that is that investment decisions in Australia in respect of the automotive industry are dictated in Detroit and Tokyo, and those investment decisions will not be made if there is not an appropriate regime for the automotive industry in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March last year the Government announced tariff arrangements for the industry which will see a phase down in protection to the year 2000. It accepted the recommendations of the Industry Commission report. It is a real challenge to the industry to meet the additional competition from imports which it will now face as a result of reduced tariffs. The phase down in tariffs was decided at a time when the Government did not envisage large scale imports of second-hand vehicles from Japan.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just as they do in the United Kingdom. At least we are up-front about this. A flood of these imports would be an intolerable additional competitive pressure. Those who advocate such imports&mdash;and there have been some pathetic attempts to do that&mdash;say they would create work for Australians fitting new tyres and new seat belts in second-hand imported Japanese cars. That company will spend $37,000 a month on fitting seat belts and tyres to these cars. That is what is said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, because it has been adopted by interjection, that is the Opposition's view of what industry policy in this country ought to be about&mdash;a few Australians in screwdriver industries working for overseas industries in this country. That is not what it is about.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This Government is committed to a manufacturing base for the automotive industry and the components industry. That industry is now exporting from Australia for the first time in 30 years. Last year its exports were worth $1.1 billion. It is not an industry based on changing tyres and adding seat belts.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is how much Senator Panizza knows about dumping. New Zealand faced this problem earlier than we did. In 1986, before second-hand Japanese car imports took off, new cars accounted for 94.95 per cent of registrations in New Zealand. In 1991 that figure had dropped to 48.5 per cent and in a big overall market new car sales were down by 20,000 in 1991 when compared to 1986.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Government will not let second-hand imports jeopardise employment in the Australian car industry. As I said on 3 December, we will impose a tariff on second-hand cars brought into Australia at high volume and, if that tariff is not sufficient, then further action will be taken by the Government in due course.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Has the Minister seen reports of statements by the Leader of the Opposition that the coalition is investigating the New Zealand system of replacing awards with individually negotiated employment contracts because `that type of approach is worth considering'?  Has he seen later reports that Mr Howard is backing away from his Leader's policy in favour of one in which employers and workers can agree to remain within the award system?  Is the Government considering either option in its forthcoming reform of the system? Further, what protection from exploitation would either option give to individual workers?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not considering any policy moves of that nature. We do not share the Liberal Party vision of turning Australian workers and Australian wages policy into the poor white trash of Asia. We believe in a wages policy which is based on high skill, flexible workplaces and training and which will lead as a basis of that to a highly skilled manufacturing sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen the remarks of Dr Hewson in New Zealand and the qualifying remarks of Mr Howard&mdash;who is these days increasingly, I must say, a bitter man&mdash;which are scrambling to try to put a human face on the stark realities that Dr Hewson is talking about for Australia: the stark reality that he intends, if he gets the chance&mdash;and I do not suspect he will&mdash;to introduce into this country the New Zealand system of employment contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What that means is that the Industrial Relations Commission is abandoned. What that means is that the award system that has served Australians well in having an independent umpire determine minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment for Australian workers is abandoned and set aside. What this system means is that the national wage case, which corrects wages for economic adjustments over time, is set aside, abandoned and no longer occurs. What this system, the Hewson system, means is that once again we would see the spectacle in this country, as we did during the Fraser years, of a government making war on that section of the Australian community that happens to be members of trade unions. We do not intend to support any of those changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Mr Howard has said is disingenuous in the extreme. He has said that the Opposition would retain the arbitration commission where both parties agree to do so. That means that where an unscrupulous employer agrees not to do so, that unscrupulous employer has the power of veto and, therefore, the worker in that situation has no access to the Commission. That is disingenuous. It pretends that somehow or other the Opposition supports the Commission system by the use of smart lawyer-like language, but the intent is to encourage employers to veto access to the Commission, veto access to the umpire, and prevent there being fair determinations made in particular circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the remarks of Mr Howard have to stand exposed for what they are. While he has tried not to endorse the policy of his Leader, Dr Hewson, nonetheless he is pursuing under the clothes of a more human face the same pernicious policy in industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is all in stark contrast to what the Premier of Tasmania has been saying over recent days. Over recent days Ray Groom, the Liberal Premier of Tasmania, has indicated that he supports working with and through trade unionists to resolve industrial disputes. He supports the Industrial Relations Commission. What he has also said is that he does not intend to drag Tasmania down the New Zealand road; he does not intend to drag Tasmania down the New South Wales confrontationist road; and that he intends to encourage APPM in that particular dispute to come to the bargaining table and negotiate properly and fairly with its workers against whom it has taken unilateral action. For his pains, Premier Groom has been attacked by the H.R. Nicholls Society and asked to desist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks by calling on Dr Hewson and Mr Howard to support Premier Groom; to tell the H.R. Nicholls Society to butt off out of industrial relations, to get out of the scene; to renounce their ideological driven agenda; to get off the New Zealand road; to get off emulating the confrontation of New South Wales; and to support the pragmatic, realistic approach of Premier Groom and help him solve a practical industrial relations problem which has economic implications for this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question would be more appropriately addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I shall refer to a couple of the points raised by Senator Coulter. The Government has strongly expressed its concerns about events in East Timor. I believe that the Prime Minister had very constructive and positive discussions with the Indonesian Government about some of the long term problems of East Timor which in part may have led to the massacre which occurred in Dili last year.</PARA></TALK.START>

I was in Indonesia a little before Senator Evans and discussed these issues with representatives of the Indonesian Government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the Prime Minister's visit to Indonesia. The Prime Minister raised with the Indonesian Government not only Australia's abhorrence about the events in Dili last year but also issues relating to poverty in East Timor, the role of the Indonesian army in East Timor and the question of whether there could be some mutual consideration between Australia and Indonesia of poverty alleviating programs in East Timor which would help the population in the longer term.</PARA>

I understand the debating point in Senator Coulter's question, but I am not sure whether there is an appropriate analogy between the United Nations Security Council resolution against Libya in respect of terrorism internationally, leading to the Lockerbie disaster amongst other things, and events which took place in East Timor.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A. REPORT ON THE INCIDENT AT THE IRANIAN EMBASSY ON 6 APRIL, 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government was seriously concerned at inadequacies in the official response to threats to the Iranian Embassy in Canberra on Monday 6 April 1992 which led to a violent incident involving injury to persons and considerable damage to property. Ministers, as a consequence, directed departments and agencies to prepare a full report on the incident in the context of Australia's obligations to protect its diplomatic community and the protective security measures which are maintained to provide that protection. This report contains the conclusions reached by officials in reporting to Ministers about the incident.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's International Obligations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The international legal regime obliges Australia to take all appropriate steps to give special protection to diplomatic and consular representatives and missions in Australia</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. These obligations arise from the&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Vienna Convention on Consular Relations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Convention of the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes Against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. These obligations include the requirements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. to take appropriate measures to prevent any attack on the personal freedom or dignity of diplomatic agents while in Australia for the purposes of performing their functions;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. to take appropriate measures to protect the premises of a diplomatic or consular mission and the private residences of diplomatic officers and administrative and technical staff of a diplomatic mission against any intrusion or damage and to prevent any disturbance of the peace or impairment of the dignity of such premises; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.should protective measures fail, to apply the full force of the law to obtain the arrest and bring to trial offenders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. Australia has enacted legislation establishing a statutory basis for the provision and enforcement of this special protection. This legislation creates particular offences in relation to offences against missions and members of missions. Moreover, Australia maintains special protective measures for the diplomatic community in the form of the guarding and patrolling of premises of missions and other buildings, and (for members of missions who are at high risk) police escorts. These are important special measures which supplement the general protection the diplomatic community enjoys through the existence and enforcement of the general criminal laws within each jurisdiction in Australia, and the general preventive measures such as immigration barrier controls which are maintained to protect Australia from acts of politically motivated violence. Certain diplomatic missions maintain their own security arrangements, eg United States, Saudi Arabia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. Around 1500 offices and residences within Australia are occupied by diplomatic and consular staff, including honorary representatives and trade and other officials. Of this total there are 725 premises in the ACT, 397 in New South Wales, 117 in Victoria, 42 in South Australia, 60 in Western Australia, 59 in Queensland, 17 in the Northern Territory and 22 in Tasmania. Particular measures have been implemented for high-risk missions: Israel, Turkey, and (since the 6 April incident) Iran.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. General and specific threats against diplomatic and consular representation in Australia are constantly assessed and responded to. The APS, over the last eighteen months, has responded to some 300 demonstrations and other significant security incidents involving the diplomatic community. The PSCC has, over the last twelve months, formally requested and received about twenty five threat assessments from ASIO about diplomatic security in addition to information provided during day-to-day consultations and during regular and special coordination meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. The cost of the protective arrangements funded by DFAT amounted to $6.34m in 1991; $4.34m has been budgeted for 1991-92, but this will be exceeded. Substantial additional costs are incurred by other agencies including the AFP, State and Territory police forces and intelligence bodies in meeting the Government's diplomatic security obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Responsibility for Security of Diplomatic and Consular Missions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9. The responsibilities of departments and agencies for diplomatic and consular security under current arrangements are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) is responsible for the security of diplomatic and consular missions, in accordance with Australia's international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The Protective Services Co-ordination Centre (PSCC), a branch of The Federal Justice Office within the Attorney-General's Department, is responsible for inter-agency coordination of responses to threats or incidents and for the development of appropriate consultative machinery and the provision of coordinated advice to Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The Australian Protective Service (APS) is tasked by DFAT on a fee for service basis to provide static guarding and mobile patrols for the protective security of diplomatic premises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.State Territory police are responsible for community policing: in the ACT this responsibility is met by the Australian Federal Police (AFP). ASIO is responsible for the provision of threat assessments.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Events of 6 April: Conclusions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11. Ministers directed senior officials of responsible departments and agencies to investigate what went wrong and report to them. Mr Peter Kennedy, Deputy Public Service Commissioner, assisted with aspects of this process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12. Officials found that the major reason for the failure of protective procedures was that critical information was not communicated promptly enough or in sufficient detail to the right people to trigger appropriate responses, and that as a result the decisions made and actions taken by those to whom information was provided, in the event, were either insufficient or inappropriate. Particular conclusions were that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. The Iranian Embassy gave timely advice by speaking to the APS at 2.54 am on 6 April, in accordance with standing guidelines to diplomatic missions, of a possible threat to their security. The APS responded to this advice by increasing patrols and by advising the AFP at 3.33 a.m. They did not advise DFAT until 8.40 am, nor did they advise the PSCC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. The AFP responded by increasing patrols from 3.50 am. They did not advise ASIO until 8.30 am nor did they advise the PSCC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. News accessible by 2.44 am from the international wire service AAP (subscribed to by DFAT, ASIO, and AFP) included information that Iranian embassies in a number of western countries had been attacked. This, coupled with the initial Iranian Embassy request for additional security at 2.54 am, suggested the possibility of a coordinated campaign worldwide against Iranian diplomatic representation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Officers in some agencies became aware during the morning of media reports of attacks on Iranian Embassies. Nobody in any of four agencies aware of the request from the Iranian Embassy (APS, AFP, DFAT and ASIO) advised the PSCC, and thus initiated the process of coordinated consultation on the need for increased security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. The AFP contacted ASIO about the advice from the Embassy and about a media report of attacks on Iranian embassies overseas, but spoke to the ACT Regional Office rather than Central Office. Although the Regional Office took action on the information it was not passed on for some considerable time to Central Office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. In spite of the contact with the AFP, ASIO did not recognise, either by internal decision or outside request, the possible need for advice to other agencies and departments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. The APS, while it did fully pass on to the AFP the information it had received from the Iranian Embassy, did not provide DFAT with all relevant information in its possession.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. DFAT did not give sufficient weight to the information and advice provided by APS suggesting a static guard. In this context, DFAT did not have information from its own sources nor had it accessed information from any public sources on the gravity of the threat.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Nobody in possession of the information about the request from the Iranian Embassy made a written report on the content of that information to any other agency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13. The officers involved have been counselled concerning the deficiencies in the handling of the threat information. Any question of disciplinary proceedings is a matter for the relevant Secretaries and Agency Heads.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Action in Response to the Incident</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14. The AFP and APS responded immediately to the incident and follow-up action included upgrading protection of Iranian Embassy personnel and property including the residences of Embassy staff. The AFP and ASIO initiated prompt investigatory action (10 arrests have been made).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15. The acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Kerin, issued a statement in which he condemned the attack and expressed the Government's sincere regrets to the Iranian Government and the Iranian Embassy. He said that the Government would ensure that all necessary action would be taken to prosecute the perpetrators and would pay for the damage in accordance with Australia's obligations relating to the protection of diplomatic premises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16. In response to officials' conclusions about the events of 6 April, Ministers directed departments and agencies to take steps immediately to correct the deficiencies identified in the arrangements and procedures relating to the security of diplomatic and consular missions. The measures which departments and agencies adopted to correct the deficiencies are set out in Document B.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">B. PROCEDURES FOR DIPLOMATIC SECURITY</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Departments and agencies have reviewed their arrangements and implemented changes designed to overcome deficiencies identified in the light of the 6 April incident. These changes include action to define more clearly the roles of agencies as they relate particularly to diplomatic and consular protection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pre-existing Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The essential features of the arrangements in place before 6 April have been:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. With respect to information and intelligence handling, all Commonwealth agencies inform ASIO, and State/ Territory police forces where appropriate, of information relating to known or possible acts of politically motivated violence. ASIO in turn advises appropriate agencies of any information relevant to them. The PSCC advises relevant agencies both Federal and State of changes in the counter-terrorism level of alert.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. With respect to the notification of terrorist incidents, the relevant police forces advise PSCC and ASIO. The PSCC begins the coordination process by advising members of the Special Interdepartmental Committee on Protection Against Violence (SIDC-PAV) and appropriate members of the Standing Advisory Committee on Commonwealth/State Co-ordination for Protection Against Violence (SAC-PAV).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.With respect to the security of diplomatic missions, missions notify either the AFP or the APS of any immediate threat to their safety requiring urgent response. In the case of less immediate threats, missions address their concerns to DFAT. (Missions, including that of Iran, were briefed in 1990, and again in 1991, on these arrangements.)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerning immediate threats, the AFP and APS advise DFAT as soon as possible, as well as ASIO. The AFP determines the appropriate community policing response and DFAT assesses whether or not additional APS protection might be necessary and if so authorises additional measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All SIDC-PAV members consult with PSCC on the need for a coordinated response, and the PSCC where appropriate commissions a threat assessment from ASIO. PSCC may also convene a special meeting of relevant agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. A number of missions supplement the protection provided under these arrangements with their own guarding arrangements and by installing security systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Improvements to Procedures</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. Changes which agencies have introduced to make these procedures more effective include the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PSCC</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Additional training and development activities will be introduced for all departments and agencies to ensure that all officers involved in the coordination process maintain their familiarity with national security arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Responsible departments and agencies have been reminded of the requirement for them to notify the PSCC of any information which suggests that a threat to a diplomatic mission's security may occur and the National Anti-Terrorist Plan and supporting documentation is being amended to clarify procedures and responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">APS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Procedures have been revised to ensure that APS regional offices quickly pass information concerning potential threats not only to relevant police (State/AFP) but also to DFAT, ASIO and the PSCC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Improvements have been made in internal methods for recording information concerning potential threats to missions and for distributing written advice by facsimile to other agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Should there be a disagreement over the adequacy of measures taken in response to a threat, officers who are more senior will be consulted at any time and, if required, the established consultative arrangements will be activated through PSCC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.A review has been initiated with DFAT as to the need for possible additional security measures at particular missions and residences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AFP</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Procedures have been revised, including those which ensure that the national office of ASIO, rather than the ACT Regional Office, and the PSCC are advised of incidents or potential incidents concerning missions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DFAT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Improved internal consultative arrangements have been established to ensure wider and more timely consideration and action in response to a threat to a mission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The need to maintain contact with diplomatic missions to obtain access to any further advice and to advise of decisions taken has been stressed in the revised procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Procedures for the recording of information received and action taken have been improved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Improved arrangements have been made to ensure 24 hour contact in Canberra on issues relating to diplomatic security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Closer monitoring of the inward wire service has been instituted to ensure that responsible areas of the Department are alerted to overseas events which may lead to threats to diplomatic missions in Australia</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Issues arising from the 6 April incident have been drawn to the attention of overseas posts, which have been reminded of the particular need to be alert to developments overseas which may have implications for the security of diplomatic and consular missions in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ASIO</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Arrangements have been made to accelerate the communication of information from regional offices to the appropriate intelligence branch in ASIO's Central Office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Procedures for the monitoring of media reports of terrorist incidents have been changed to speed up the passage of reports to intelligence branch desk officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Procedures have been revised to ensure that advice of a threat to a mission, and where appropriate an assessment of the threat, is routinely distributed to other agencies. In particular, procedures will ensure that PSCC is advised of all threats to diplomats and diplomatic missions.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that the inadequacies revealed by the incident at the Iranian Embassy constitute grounds for examining existing plans and arrangements in relation to counter-terrorism, based upon a detailed review by all relevant agencies of their procedures.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed it was. The Government's position on the use of drugs in sport has not changed. The Government remains strongly opposed to the use of drugs in sport. The drug testing regime of the Australian Sports Drug Agency, ASDA, is probably the most thorough in the world by virtue of its comprehensive procedures and its recognition of the importance of human rights, natural justice and privacy matters. In fact, its requirements are stricter than those of the International Olympic Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as Mr Vinnicombe is concerned, let there be no doubt about the results of his tests&mdash;they were positive. The sample was collected in accordance with International Olympic Committee standards and was tested at an IOC accredited laboratory. However, the test did not meet the stricter requirements of the ASDA legislation which formed the basis of the recent court action by Mr Vinnicombe. This, I understand, is what led to the recent problems in the Vinnicombe case. That is why the Minister for Sport, Mrs Kelly, approved drafting instructions on 12 April to amend the ASDA Act so that ASDA can officially recognise the results of tests conducted by other agencies when those tests are conducted in accordance with internationally accepted protocols.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will, and I am delighted to say that it will. Any efforts that can be made and directions that can be adopted which will focus further attention on northern Australia are very welcome so far as I am concerned. ASTEC is the Commonwealth Government's principal source of policy advice on scientific and technical matters. This particular reference came directly from its report last year entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Research and Technology: Future Directions</EMPHASIS>. The report underlines the importance of tropical zone research and technology as a critical area of economic and social benefit to Australia, the only economically advanced nation in the world that has a very high proportion of its land mass in the tropics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is increasing interest in tropical science technology and development, and ASTEC believes that Australia has the potential to become a world and regional leader in tropical zone products and processes. Australia possesses expertise in areas such as biotechnology, especially in agricultural and forestry applications, medicine, including pharmaceutical products, and food processing. The challenge is to apply this expertise more effectively in tropical areas and to realise the potential for significant economic returns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ASTEC concluded in its report last year that this unique opportunity for Australia to exploit its natural competitive advantage in tropical agriculture, medicine and technobiology has been neglected. The Government took this advice and commissioned the study. Preliminary consultation suggests that this study is timely, and I already know from personal experience&mdash;having been approached by a number of people already in the Northern Territory&mdash;that this matter has become a matter of wide interest to the scientific and research community in northern Australia, which has already approached me about making submissions to the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Federal Opposition has attacked the study. The shadow spokesperson for northern development, Senator Tambling, issued a press statement claiming that the Federal Government was neglecting development in favour of such studies.

I had long since forgotten that particular sally. My position on this matter is essentially the same as that of Mr Keating. I agree that there are difficulties in presenting and projecting Australia abroad with the present symbolism.

Is the Minister aware of the recent study commissioned by the Victorian Industrial Supplies Office, and reported on in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, which indicates that each $1m of imports saved creates 30 person years of employment, $280,000 in taxes and charges for all levels of government, $255,000 in direct consumer spending and $231,000 in welfare expenditure savings? In light of these figures, is the Minister prepared to stop all further tariff cuts, including the proposed tariff reduction for sugar, and to use tariffs strategically, that is, to provide time and resources to boost our import replacement capacity through specific incentives, to protect regional industries and to protect workers and their families, even when it becomes necessary to phase out over time certain industries and to redirect resources?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not read the particular study done by the Victorian Industrial Supplies Office. After several years as a Minister, I have read a number of reports of that kind. There is no doubt that calculations which may or may not be right can be made to present that particular picture. While I accept that they may be partially true, I disagree with many of the premises on which those studies are based.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler essentially asked whether this Government will not proceed with its announced tariff reduction for sugar in July of this year. The answer to that question is no. He asked about a wide range of other tariff reductions and whether we can somehow strategically use the tariff system to advance the special sectoral interests of the Australian industrial community and so on. I do not believe that we can do that. I do not believe that there are valid intellectual reasons for seeking to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assumption in the question is that tariff protection&mdash;the question contains the word `protection'&mdash;protects jobs. The fundamental flaw in that argument in a contemporary world is that the thing which reduces jobs in particular industries and diverts them into other industries is changes in technology, not artificial tariff protection. If we look at the major changes in job and employment patterns which have taken place in Australia in the last few years, they are essentially due to changes in technology, not to changes in tariff protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For years of high tariff protection in this country industries such as the motor vehicle industry kept losing jobs. The industry lost more jobs under the Liberal Government, which had enormously high tariffs in the motor vehicle industry, than it has lost under this Government's motor vehicle plan. There are reasons for that: it has become inherently uncompetitive and lazy. A whole range of behavioural considerations follow for industries which are protected by high tariffs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the same with the textiles, clothing and footwear industry. We cannot establish industries in this country which can compete in labour intensive activities with the countries to our north. We cannot compete with $8 a week wages without tariffs. That would send the average worker, the average employee, in this country broke. But with a system of tariffs which help direct industry into areas in which it can compete by quality, fashion, design or particular characteristics related to raw materials and so on we can achieve positive results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer to Senator Spindler's question is that tariffs are not a solution to regional policies or any of the other things he mentioned. There may be other things which are and ought to be solutions, but not tariffs.</PARA>

At that stage I submitted the resignation to, I think, the secretary of the Party for forwarding to 2HD.

The article makes a number of observations about the way in which the so-called raid was conducted, including that police allegedly refused to provide any reason for the raid and an allegation that the operation was regarded by police as a fishing expedition. Not to put too fine a point on it, the article seeks to leave the impression that the operation was a vindictive, politically inspired act taken without good cause.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Land Transport has supplied the following answer to the Honourable Senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Western Australian Government has submitted its 1991/92 program of black spots for consideration. However, the Minister for Land Transport has indicated to the Western Australian Minister for Transport that the program will not be approved until Western Australia has met the requirements of an agreement reached with it in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Black Spot Program introduced in 1990 was conditional upon States and Territories agreeing to introduce a range of road safety measures. The same conditions were negotiated with all States and Territories. Although the Western Australian Government agreed to do this, a number of important measures have yet to be passed by the Western Australian Parliament. In particular these include:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislation has been before the Western Australian Parliament on some of these issues now for almost two years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Land Transport has indicated to the Western Australian Government that he will not approve the 1991/92 program until the requirements of the agreement are met. These are extremely important initiatives which will help improve the safety on Western Australia's roads. They will also bring Western Australia into line with traffic rules in all other States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1991 road fatalities in Western Australia rose by 5.6 per cent against a national reduction of 9.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his "One Nation" statement the Prime Minister announced that an additional $70 million would be made available for black spots in 1991/92 and 1992/93. $25 million of this will be allocated during the current financial year. Western Australia's allocation from these funds is $7.7 million, of which $2.5 million is to be allocated in 1991/92.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Land Transport requested the Western Australian Minister for Transport to submit projects for this "One Nation" Program by 31 March 1992. No projects have yet been nominated by Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 2 April 1992, Senator Lees asked me a question about the number of hours of part time voluntary work that could be undertaken by unemployed people who met their obligations under the job search activity test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I said I would make inquiries from the Minister for Social Security, Dr Blewett, and provide an answer when the Senate resumed in 2 weeks.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Job Search and Newstart Allowances are usually paid to unemployed persons who are available for and actively seeking full-time employment.

<PARA>It is absolutely essential that the Senate has the opportunity today to reaffirm its support for the existing national flag in view of the appalling behaviour of the Australian Prime Minister, Mr Keating.

Never before has an Australian Prime Minister behaved in that way: gone to a foreign country and talked down our Constitution and those symbols of Australia that are important to so many Australians and under which Australians have died. The Prime Minister did this for his own domestic political purposes. In some way&mdash;and beyond the competence of most&mdash;he believes, in Senator Evans's terms, that that is the way to cement our relationships within this region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, can you imagine former Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew coming down here and talking down his national symbols?

Can you imagine Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia coming here and talking down the Malaysian heritage? Of course we cannot imagine that, because no prime minister would do that. No prime minister worth his salt would embarrass his country in that way. But Mr Keating did so, as I said, because he thought there would be some benefit for him back home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating believes in some way that the identity of Australia is confused and that the way to clarify that identity is to change and rewrite our history in many ways, to change our heritage, to change our flag, to change our constitution, and that then, somehow or another, we will have a different Australia.

Mr Keating has not only embarrassed Australia; he has ridiculed us in front of the nations with which we should be building real relations for the future.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue was raised, in equally interesting terms, in Canada in the mid-1960s. It generated an equally strident debate, spread over several years, involving very rowdy Party discussions and very comprehensive assaults on the integrity of the Government of the kind that we have heard today. In the result, a new flag was adopted by Canada in 1964 which has done immense things to generate a sense of national unity and national pride in that country. It has given that country an extraordinarily strong identity in the world at large.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The word that keeps emerging is `identity'. The Australian people have to determine what sort of identity they want and what sort of symbols they want to represent that identity. That will require quite a long and detailed process of consultation and participation by the public.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it will require legislative change to alter the flag, it will require at least two referenda.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nor should we stop with the flag as a symbol of our national identity. When one looks at the words of our national anthem, one finds that they do not reflect, in many respects, the national identity that I think is important. For instance, they totally disregard the Aboriginal heritage of this country. We talk about a young country, but we ignore the fact that Aboriginal people have been here for 40,000 or 60,000 years. That is a symbol that we could well change. That would also go very much to the heart of what sort of identity we want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Prime Minister's raising this matter at this time is very much a diversionary tactic. There are far more important things to be debated and decided by this Parliament at this time than whether we should change the symbols of our national identity, including the flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me back fairly and squarely to the remarks made by the Prime Minister in Indonesia. It is totally inappropriate for the Prime Minister to parade&mdash;in fact, I would use the word `flaunt'&mdash;his insecurity regarding his identity as an Australian before foreigners. If the Prime Minister has some concern about his identity as an Australian, it is appropriate to discuss that in Australia and to involve himself in that debate, but it is quite inappropriate&mdash;and I agree entirely with Senator Hill on this point&mdash;for him to go to Indonesia and discuss those matters before other people. That should only occur, if it occurs at all, long after the Australian people have decided what sort of identity and symbols they want to reflect that identity. </PARA>

There is probably more difference between the Asian nations than there is between the nations of Europe. To replace, as he appears to be doing, the tugging of the forelock to Great Britain with the tugging of the forelock to `Asia' again seems to misunderstand entirely the way in which Australia will relate later to those many nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply conclude by saying that we support the notion of a wide-ranging and long term debate on these issues of national identity and national symbols, but it is not appropriate at this time.

The Union Jack represents the three flags of St George, St Andrew and St Patrick. So apart from its long historic traditions, the flag also represents to some degree some religious connotations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think anybody should attempt to trivialise this debate about the flag, as Senator Parer and Senator Hill attempted to do, by trying to link a very natural desire to have our own individual symbol with an attempt to rewrite history, or with the fact that servicemen who gave their lives in previous military campaigns for this country fought under that particular flag, as Canadian servicemen did and, indeed, as did United States servicemen&mdash;a former British colony&mdash;when it was part of the British Empire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to trivialise the debate because it is an important debate and because the flag is the pre-eminent national symbol of this country, and national symbols are important. I would like to contribute briefly to this debate because I, along with Senator Tambling, come from the one part of Australia where we do have a symbol. If I could be forgiven at this point for referring to the Northern Territory as a State&mdash;or at least equating it with a State, as it will certainly one day become&mdash;we have a State flag in the Northern Territory which is the only flag in Australia that does not have the Union Jack on it, and a very attractive symbol it has become. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision deliberately not to have a Union Jack on it was taken, to his credit, by the now President of the Queensland Liberal Party, Paul Everingham, when he was Chief Minister of the Northern Territory.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put the fundamental view&mdash;and I do not think it is an unreasonable one&mdash;that since the flag is our pre-eminent national symbol, then 90-plus years after officially becoming an independent nation it is about time we had a flag which was a truly independent, pre-eminent national symbol. It is an irritant to me&mdash;and I freely confess it&mdash;that 90 years after gaining so-called independence from Great Britain we still, as the most prominent feature of our own flag, fly the flag of another nation. That would irritate me if it were the flag of Canada or New Zealand or Yugoslavia or anywhere else; it just happens to be Great Britain's flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Question Time, by way of interjection&mdash;indeed, with my tongue in my cheek, and as a little jest, if I could be forgiven for that&mdash;I said that we do need our own flag; either we should have our own flag or the Poms should stop using the corner out of ours. That was said only slightly tongue in cheek because I think it is important that we have a distinct national symbol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proud of the Northern Territory's flag. I commend Paul Everingham. Indeed when I was the Leader of the Opposition in the Northern Territory at the time I publicly supported him for having a flag that did not have&mdash;and it is the only State flag that does not have&mdash;the Union Jack on it. We did not have a competition to design the flag. The Northern Territory Government simply employed a very prominent Australian, Robert Ingpen, to design it, and there was our flag&mdash;black, white and ochre with, I am pleased to say, the Southern Cross still on it. I support Senator Parer there; the one thing I want to see remain on our flag is the Southern Cross, which is so distinctive and internationally designates this country and New Zealand. We retained that on the Northern Territory flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To express a personal preference, I do not think we should have international or national competitions to design a new flag because, like a lot of other people in this country, I have my own views about what it should be. I am horrified by suggestions that we should cover it in boomerangs, kangaroos, emus, echidnas and various other symbols. I personally favour the suggestion by the National Flag Committee of removing the Union Jack from our Flag and lifting the Commonwealth Star into a central position and then leaving it as it is. It would then be a matter for debate as to whether it remains the existing blue and white&mdash;which I would not worry about personally; I think they are quite appropriate colours&mdash;or whether we should have the green and gold which in recent years have come to symbolise Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We did it for our mates and never has the mournful sound of the Last Post (played against the backdrop of a small flag hanging limp under rain and thick canopy) been more soul-stirring.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He will find it very difficult to convince those 16 diggers that the flag they saluted on that dismal afternoon is flawed and should be changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Alcorta has expressed very eloquently the feeling that so many Australians felt on ANZAC Day as thousands of Australians marched through the streets, proudly bearing the Australian national flag, and proud to say that it is the flag for which comrades have died. This is the same flag that was tenderly created by inmates of the Changi prisoner-of-war camp on the pain and penalty of punishment and death. They stitched together with bamboo needles from the pieces of rag that they managed to gather a replica of the national flag, a flag of which they can be proud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry for members of the Labor Party who have no identity, who feel that they are wandering lost souls. I am sorry that we have sent the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;a boy on a man's errand&mdash;to try to negotiate and strengthen our ties in our own region. I am ashamed of this boy on a man's errand who does not know the difference between diplomacy and being able to speak with the voice of authority of a nation that respects him. I do not respect the Prime Minister for what he has done, and thousands upon thousands of other Australians feel angered, as I feel angered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say in all sincerity that the Labor Party has made a bad error of judgment, for very political purposes, to try to camouflage the fact that this is the lot who brought us the recession we had to have, who gave us a million unemployed, who single-handedly lowered the standard of living of ordinary Australians, and who now want to change the flag. Why? Do not change the flag; change the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are a proud people. I know I am Australian; other Australians know that they are Australian. There is no conflict.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the request of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senate Hill) and pursuant to contigent notice, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Hill moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely, a motion to give precedence to General Business order of the day no. 40 standing in the name of Senator Parer relating to the Flags Amendment Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition is taking this further step in relation to the preservation of the existing national flag because it is deeply concerned about the situation that the Government, in particular the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), has created about the future of the Australian national flag and what the Government has in mind in relation to the flag over the next year or two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short space of time that the Prime Minister has held office, he has raised the issues of Australian nationalism and the monarchy and he has now raised the future of the Australian national flag. Apart from the extraordinary and despicable way in which he has raised it in the last few days&mdash;namely, in the course of a visit to a foreign country&mdash;he has definitely placed on the agenda for the immediate concern of the Australian people and also, I would have thought, of this Senate, what the Government's intentions are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This afternoon we endeavoured in the Senate to find out the order of the Government's program in relation to the future of the flag. We have clear evidence of that from not only the Prime Minister but also from the behaviour and comments of a number of Government senators, including the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button). The Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, and Senator Collins have both indicated clearly that the Government has an agenda to change the national flag, and to do so without necessarily having a referendum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any change to the flag would require, of course, an amendment to the Australian National Flags Act. This Parliament would have to make a decision before the flag could be changed. The flag can be changed by this Parliament and such a decision would not require a referendum of the Australian people. Senator Parer's Bill is designed to ensure that a referendum would be required before the Australian national flag could be changed in any respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very important matter. It is important that this principle be established. Senator Collins has agreed that the flag is our principal national symbol. The flag is not, in effect, part of our written Constitution. But it is clearly part and parcel of our Constitution and any changes to it should be treated in the same way as are changes to the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We endeavoured today to obtain an undertaking from Senator Button, the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Senator Evans made clear in answer to a question from Senator Hill how he sees this process proceeding. As I have said, Senator Collins, who has spoken on this matter in an earlier debate, indicated that the Government is engaged in a process of changing the flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incidentally, I asked Senator Robert Ray, the Minister for Defence, whether he would affirm support for the flag. He gave a very delphic answer in which he referred me to the Australian Labor Party constitution. It seems to me that this is a very roundabout way of saying that the flag would be part of a process which would culminate by the year 2001 in a new Constitution for Australia. However, I am not clear what in fact Senator Evans has in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this chamber and the nation are left in a complete state of limbo. We know from past polling that a clear majority of Australian people are at present opposed to changing the flag. The Government is equivocating on the way in which the Australian people will be consulted on this most important matter. It is vital and urgent that Senator Parer's Bill, which clarifies this matter, should be brought on for debate forthwith. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will be opposing this second motion to suspend Standing Orders for the reasons that I thought were put very succinctly by Senator Coulter, the Leader of the Australian Democrats. This is an important debate. I think I clearly affirmed that when I spoke in an earlier debate on the suspension of Standing Orders. It is going to be a long debate. I hope that as many citizens of this country as possible will participate in this debate which I believe will continue for a significant time. This is what happened in the case of the citizens of Canada. It is instructive to look at the public record of the debate in that country. In 1964 Canada moved to adopt a flag which I personally think is one of the more attractive and distinctive national symbols that exist today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter is quite right&mdash;it is going to be a long debate. There will be endless opportunities to debate this matter in the Senate and I dare say that every one of them will be taken up. But this matter does not need to be debated this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, I would like to correct a number of assertions we have heard that are quite wrong. Just a moment ago Senator Durack said that I had indicated some government agenda to change the flag. Of course, I did nothing of the sort. I could hardly have made it more clear that I was simply speaking personally, as I hope most Australians will, on this issue. I was indicating a personal preference for a flag. I thought it was appropriate to point out that in a debate which, I must say, was not fiery at all, we adopted a flag for the Northern Territory. For the first time in Australia the flag of a political entity in this country did not contain the Union Jack. That flag is a very attractive and appropriate national symbol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard the nonsense put forward in this debate&mdash;and it will continue to be put forward&mdash;that nations, for some strange reason, are fixed in time and place. We are told that things never change. This is nonsense. Honourable senators who want to dispute that should refer to the development of the Union Jack itself. They should look at why it came to be called the Union Jack. The same sort of debate&mdash;if one likes to call it that&mdash;took place when that flag was being put together. They should look at the historical facts. It is nonsense to seriously suggest that an attempt is being made to rewrite Australian history by changing the flag to a more appropriate national symbol. It is also nonsense to suggest that this is some kind of betrayal. I must say that this is one of the cheapest&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, I may be pathetic but the honourable senator is Ian Macdonald, and that is infinitely worse. It is a piece of utter nonsense to cheapen the debate and reduce it to the lowest common denominator&mdash;and this has been done here again this afternoon&mdash;by suggesting that this is some kind of betrayal of the service men and women who died while serving under the present flag. Of course, the symbolism contained in the current flag will not be altered. The symbolism will not be removed from the historical record because people think that a change in the flag is more appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat, for what it is worth: I think it is a significant irritant to a great many Australians&mdash;and I am one of them&mdash;that 90 years after we became independent we still have as the most prominent feature on our own flag the flag of another nation. It is absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to correct the record in respect of one other matter. In his opening remarks to this debate, Senator Hill made the point&mdash;and obviously Senator Hill has not availed himself of the work that has been done in recent years&mdash;that we should not be ashamed that this country began as a British colony. I want to point out that, of course, is an absurd piece of nonsense. That, in one sweep of the brush, omits 40,000 years of recorded human occupation of this continent by Aboriginal people. This record can be set against the mere 200 years of European occupation of this country. Indeed, as anyone who has taken the trouble to have a look will know, we are talking about a complex and sophisticated community involving interrelationships, extremely complex languages and ceremonial customs that have existed for thousands of years prior to European occupation of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply conclude by saying again: I am glad that this debate is continuing in Australia. It is going to be a long process. I hope that everyone will have a contribution to make. But no case has been made out that it needs to be dealt with this afternoon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If there were one reason why it is urgent to bring forward Senator Parer's Flag Amendment Bill for debate, that reason was contained in the answer given today by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, to a question asked by Senator Parer. Senator Button was asked to give an unequivocal commitment that the Australian flag would not be changed without there being a referendum held of the Australian people. He was given the opportunity twice to commit the Government to that course of action. He deliberately and very obviously refused on both occasions to give such a commitment. That is what the core of Senator Parer's Bill goes to. The purpose of the Bill is to prevent changes to Australia's national flag occurring without the prior consent of the Australian people through a referendum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that an identical Bill was passed by the Senate in 1984. It was a Bill introduced by Senator Durack. Its passage through the House of Representatives, of course, was frustrated by the then Hawke Government. It did not want to have a bar of the Bill but this Senate did pass that Bill in 1984. I introduced an identical Bill in 1987 which lay on the table until after the 1990 election. Senator Parer's Bill is the third, if you like, of the trio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are doing here is not introducing a new piece of legislation; what we want is the Senate to reaffirm the very strong endorsement it gave in 1984 to the simple fact and request that the Australian flag, the primary national symbol of this nation, should not in any way be changed without the will of the Australian people being registered through a referendum. I find it beyond comprehension that a government of this country could even contemplate changing the national flag without putting the suggestion and proposal for change to the Australian people in the form of a referendum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to ask why the Government is refusing to allow such a course of action; why it is refusing to allow debate on a Bill to do just that at this time. The reason appears to be tied up very much with the actions of the new Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in terms of the way he seems to want to run his government and the directions in which he wants to lead this country because what he is doing, almost every time he gets to his feet&mdash;be it in Australia or in foreign places&mdash;is raising issues which divide this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating, in the three or four months he has been Prime Minister, has been the most divisive Prime Minister we have had in this nation in many decades, if not ever. Why he wants to divide the nation is beyond me. Whether he thinks that for cheap, populist, political reasons he can use tactics like that to divert the attention of this country away from the misery and the hardship his economic policies have caused and whether he thinks he can hide the underemployment and unemployment of two million Australians behind such divisive diversionary tactics I do not know. This is regardless of what one thinks about the Australian flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a great supporter of the Australian flag the way it is. I believe it reflects properly a history and heritage I am intentionally and deeply proud of. The one thing I would have thought all Australians would agree on, whether they like the existing flag or whether they do not, is that they would not be prepared to see the primary symbol of Australia's nationhood changed without the reflection of the will of the people obtained through a referendum. That is precisely what this Bill is about. That is why it is urgent that it be debated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to oppose the suspension of Standing <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>Orders. I agree with the remarks Senator Collins made in this debate half an hour ago. I must say that his description of what would be a very good flag for Australia is one I almost entirely agree with: the Southern Cross, the Star of Federation, replacing the Union Jack.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to remind senators opposite about the present flag. First of all, this myth that every Australian soldier from 1901 died under the present flag is an absolute furphy, an absolute fraud. If the soldiers in the First World War had a flag when they stormed Gallipoli, it was purely the Union Jack. It was not the flag of Australia. If they had another flag, it would overwhelmingly have been the red ensign&mdash;not the flag with a blue background. Through most of the First World War it was very seldom, if at all, that Australians fought under the present flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Second World War, the blue ensign flew on a few occasions. I must say that Sir Robert Menzies, when he was Prime Minister, did give an indication that he thought it would be appropriate. But, overwhelmingly, Australian servicemen in the Second World War fought under a different flag from the one we have today. They were under the red ensign or the Union Jack again. So it has only been since 1953 that the flag those opposite all want to die in the ditch for has been the official flag of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to point out to honourable members opposite the design of the present flag with its structure of the Union Jack in the top left-hand corner. This was a condition of the competition for the design of the present flag in 1901 which every competitor had to take note of. The rules of the competition stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The flag should be based on the British ensign, as the flags of the countries added to its folds, signalling to the beholder that it is an imperial union ensign of the British Empire.</PARA>
<PARA>Of the British Empire! The Opposition is supporting a flag of an empire that no longer exists. They were the rules that were given. They were the competition rules that had to be applied in 1901. Not even the British Commonwealth exists any more; just the `Commonwealth' exists. Those opposite are going back to the nineteenth century to being people of the British Empire. Those are the people they are hankering to. Six weeks ago John Howard said, `Let's go back to the `50s, to the golden age'. Now the Opposition wants to go back to the nineteenth century. Talk about a party that is out of date and nowhere near the aspirations of modern Australia! Those opposite are it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting things I have noted in recent times is that at sporting events when Australians want to hold up a symbol of Australia, we end up with all sorts of other symbols&mdash;not the Australian flag. For the America's Cup in 1983, it was a kangaroo on a green background. That was shown all over the world as Australia's flag. Even in the recent cricket World Cup, people were showing bastardised versions of the Australian flag in other colours because, at the same ground, British supporters were waving the Union Jack. I want to remind people opposite that about a year or so ago when the Australian netball team won the world championship in Sydney, there was a photograph in the paper the next day showing the victorious team standing in front of the Australian flag. The only thing you could see was the Union Jack. It was as though Great Britain had won the world championship, not the Australian team. That was the photograph that went all around the world; an image of another country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This re-run Bill, put up by Senator Parer, is an absolute stunt. No wonder the Opposition put it up today. Today the coalition had to sack one of its frontbenchers. Mr Braithwaite resigned. The coalition is falling apart on tariff policy. This Bill is a diversion of attention from the fact that the coalition is being wagged by the Queensland National Party. Braithwaite has resigned, Ronny Boswell has won the day, and the coalition is falling apart. It is 1987 all over again and we will win the next election as a result. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the suspension of Standing Orders because there is a great deal of urgency here. We have a Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who is out of his mind and is racing around seeking votes from wherever he can find them. In the few minutes I have, I would like to deal with some of the nonsense that Senator Schacht talked about. He seems to know as much about Australian history as the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The college I lived in when I was an undergraduate had as one of its treasured mementos the flag that flew over Australian Army headquarters in France the day the Armistice was signed in 1918. I can assure Senator Schacht, apart from the fact it had a red background, that it was exactly the same as the Australian ensign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was privileged to be at the America's Cup at Newport for one of the races that we won in 1983. One of the really moving moments of my life was to come into the harbour at Newport at the end of the race to see one of the biggest Australian flags I have ever seen flying from the masthead of one of the ships at the quay side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter of urgency relates to the behaviour of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is taking Australia back to the isolationist xenophobia of the Labor Party's origins. As Senator Coulter said earlier in the day, he finds the behaviour of the Prime Minister absolutely inappropriate; the way he is flaunting his personal insecurity. I agree with that completely. I have never seen a public figure make a public display of personal insecurity the way this man is doing. It is certainly correct when Mr Keating says he does not feel an Australian. He certainly is not an Australian if we judge him by his actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He certainly has no knowledge of the subtleties of Asia. To go and run what is a very personal argument of his about our national status and standing when he is a guest in another country&mdash;and in Indonesia in particular&mdash;is absolutely indescribably counterproductive for Australia's interests. He cannot claim that it is probably the first time he has been to Indonesia. He should have been advised by people like Senator Evans and Foreign Affairs officials that Indonesia, with its Javanese culture, is a country above all others where the subtleties of behaviour are of prime importance. To do what he did has put Australia back in its relationships with that country for decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is all about a perverse nationalistic argument. I can remember a time 20 years ago when John Gorton&mdash;who was a great Australian and a great Australian Prime Minister&mdash;said of our relationships with other countries, said that we were not going to roll over like puppy dogs and let people tickle our tummies. Yet this is exactly what Paul Keating does when he goes overseas. He is rolling over like a puppy dog so that they can tickle his tummy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objectives of what he is doing are purely political. Keating has learnt from his well-funded research programs that in the marginal electorates&mdash;which those in the Labor Party are masters of winning and dominating in an election&mdash;there is a high migrant population of non-British stock. The Prime Minister has put two and two together and made five. He has  decided that, if he opposes everything that is associated with the United Kingdom and our history, then he will win votes in the electorate at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a little bit of advice for Mr Keating. In February this year I wrote to every newspaper, radio station and every other media outlet in Queensland. I enclosed a form asking people to write to me stating their views on the retention of the Australian flag. I received more than 2,000 responses and they are still coming in. They came from all age groups, all ethnic groups and all parts of the State. The result was that, out of over 2,000 responses, a staggering 84 per cent of people in Queensland were in favour of the retention of the Australian flag; 16 per cent wanted it changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advice I would give Mr Keating is that, if he wants to change the flag in the face of all the polling results, he must go to a referendum. If he finds the majority of people want to change the flag, then he can run his design competition. However, until he holds that referendum, any change is not in the interests of the Australian people and I believe will be opposed by the majority of them to his political detriment. </PARA>

One in 10 Australian couples are infertile and unable to conceive and carry a baby to birth. Having a family is one of the most fundamental and rewarding aspects of life and benefits the community as a whole. IVF is an established and proven treatment for infertility. There are existing mechanisms to regulate and control IVF, including the National Health and medical Research Council and the Reproductive Technology Accreditation Committee. Currently IVF patients pay up to $1,500 per treatment cycle for IVF out of their own pockets. This means that some couples who need IVF to help them establish their own family do not have access. We request that Medicare funding be granted for IVF for the treatment of infertility, and your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HEALTH INSURANCE (1991-92 GENERAL MEDICAL SERVICES TABLE) REGULATIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition's concerns with these regulations arose from the changes in the Medicare Benefits Schedule to the fees for optometrical and ophthalmic items.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two major changes in the regulations that concern the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the regulations provide for a reduction in the Medicare Benefits Schedule rebate paid to ophthalmologists to the same level of reimbursement paid to optometrists. Where a consultation is performed by an ophthalmologist and a refraction test is involved, the rebate will be the same as for a refraction test by an optometrist. This means a reduction in the rebate in cases where a consultation by an ophthalmologist results in the issuing of a prescription for glasses or contact lenses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government defends the change to bring the payment for refraction testing by ophthalmologists into line with that for optometrists on the grounds that it is in line with the principle of equal pay for equal work and that there is little justification for the difference in the fee. Our concerns stem from the greater legal liability and educational qualifications of ophthalmologists.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ophthalmologists follow a similar pattern of training as other medical practitioners and complete a six year medical degree followed by six years of specialist training. Optometrists undertake a 4 year degree to achieve a Bachelor of Science with study in clinical optometry and general medicine. The fourth year includes clinical experience.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would also appear that there is a greater legal liability on ophthalmologists. As medical practitioners, ophthalmologists are subject to the same legal liability for medical misdiagnosis, misconduct etc.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second item in the regulations causing concern is that from 1 December 1991 a new item number has been included in the optometrical schedule. This enables initial consultations to be separated from second consultations when carried out within a 24 month period of the first. Previously, both consultations were claimed under the one item number.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This means a rebate for a second initial consultation can be claimed within 24 months of the initial consultation where the patient has one of the conditions as set down in the Medicare Benefits Schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition is concerned that a number of the categories of ocular conditions covered in the regulations are outside the scope of optometrists. There is doubt as to whether some of the medical conditions are within the scope of both the educational and legislative ability of optometrists. However, optometrists have argued that this change only formalises the circumstances in which they have been operating.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will be familiar with a report that was tabled on the last sitting day of the Senate by the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs concerning the consideration of the Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991. That senators' report was very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw attention in particular to the dissenting report of my colleagues Senator Brownhill, Senator Calvert and Senator Crane. A number of issues canvassed in that dissenting report related specifically to the legislation then before the Senate. In particular, I note that the final paragraph of the dissenting report reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We further note that the reports requested by Senator Brownhill during the hearings, namely, the Resource Assessment Commission Final Report into the Forest Industries and a report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Resource Security, which was presented to Senator Button and other Ministers about February 1991 had not been provided to the Committee at time of writing this report. Because of this delay we are unable to assess their significance to the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have presented to the Senate the Resource Assessment Commission report on a forest and timber inquiry report which is also a very important document. I can well understand the reservations that were held by the coalition senators on that occasion in preparing their report on what is and should be important legislation before this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the Resource Assessment Commission is a comprehensive document and should be considered in detail by all honourable senators, and in fact by all people interested in this debate. In particular, I draw attention to Volume 1 where, under the heading `Improvements in Intergovernmental Processes', paragraph 1.269 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Forest Conservation and Development Bill, if it is enacted, should help to simplify assessment procedures, but only for selected projects. The Inquiry's main concern with the proposed legislation is that it applies only to projects with a threshold value of $100m.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Inquiry is concerned that the project-specific assessments provided for in the legislation could divert government resources from more comprehensive assessments that could provide a basis for planning and management of all uses of forested lands on a regional basis.</PARA>
<PARA>That quote certainly underpins the reservations that were made by honourable senators on the legislation not only in the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs but also by Senator Walters, Senator Newman, Senator Archer and myself in the debate in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, of course, many other references in this Resource Assessment Commission report which also substantiate the views and opinions that we took and the debates that we injected for important consideration. Yet at that time the Government seemed intent on pushing through legislation without thorough and proper consideration, without considering the issues and certainly at that time without the value of understanding and knowing what was to be contained in this important Resource Assessment Commission report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many quotes that could be given to underpin the views that we took at that time. There is certainly a need for the Government to comprehensively pick up many of the recommendations of the Resource Assessment Commission. Senator Cook, in his summary on the legislation at the end of the second reading debate, alluded to many issues that the Government wanted to address. But at that time we knew that the Government wished to pursue ahead at all costs without amending this legislation. That action is now seriously called into question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the legislation is listed on today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> and will come back before the Senate again either today or later this week. I would hope that the Government accepts the challenge of the reports of the Senate Standing Committee and the Resource Assessment Commission to pick up the necessary amendments and to look very seriously at the areas that we have offered, namely, the comprehensive amendments that the coalition and the Opposition have presented to the Government, and that in the consideration of this report all of these things will be taken fully into account. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was pleased to hear Senator Tambling's remarks because it is certainly true that the Resource Assessment Commission has some very harsh things to say about the so-called resource security legislation, which I believe will be debated this evening. However, I must point out to Senator Tambling that the Resource Assessment Commission has actually said that this legislation is unnecessary. If one reads the report comprehensively, one will note that it indicates that the legislation really is unnecessary and should not be supported. So I hope that the Opposition will continue with its opposition to this legislation as it outlined repeatedly with every speaker ad nauseam during the second reading stage of the debate on the resource security legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Resource Assessment Commission report that is before us now is, of course, a long awaited and very important report. I do not doubt that Senator Tambling is incorrect at all in his assessment that this report was kept from the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs at a very important time because it said things about the legislation which would have been embarrassing to the Government that was hell-bent on pushing it forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is without doubt the most comprehensive and detailed review of the Australian forests and timber industries yet conducted. For well over two years, the Resource Assessment Commission has listened to and thoroughly explored the arguments of advocates from all corners of the debate. It is a report which should be taken very seriously by the Government. It is to the great dismay of the Australian Democrats that this report has so far been totally ignored by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this report, the Resource Assessment Commission is thoroughly dismissive of the Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991 now before the Senate&mdash;the so-called resource security legislation. Yet negotiations between the Government and the Opposition are still going on in an attempt to secure its passage. I can only hope that these talks are just a continuation of the charade of the past few weeks, with the Government and Opposition desperately trying to avoid being blamed for the likely and inevitable defeat of this Bill. If, however, an agreement is about to be reached, then this report will have been a total&mdash;and I stress total&mdash;waste of resources and we can kiss goodbye to the ecologically sustainable management of our native forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission concluded that the Forest Conservation and Development Bill, if passed, `will entrench the current practice of reactive project-by-project assessment'. This is the fundamental flaw in the legislation. The Commission's preferred alternative is `cooperative, integrated, prospective'&mdash;and I stress that word prospective&mdash;`regional assessments' of natural values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key word here is regional. So rather than frantically examining a forest area only when it is proposed to be logged, we need regional assessments which are divorced from specific project proposals. Only then will we have a solid basis for the ecologically sustainable management of our forest resources. Indeed, this approach should underpin the management of all our natural resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission has dealt another blow to the resource security legislation in its finding that, `the establishment of a bleached eucalypt craft mill seems a prospect only in Tasmania', and even there it would preclude other uses of the very large areas of forest needed to feed the mill, possibly including saw log production. The Commission notes that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . forest management agencies would face strong pressure to apply short-rotation, intensive methods of silviculture, and this would significantly change forest structure and ecosystem processes.</PARA>
<PARA>There are aspects of this report that the Democrats have considerable difficulty with, particularly the findings that logging in native forests should continue and that State forest management agencies have implemented sustained yield management strategies. If they have that is certainly a very recent development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make this point to highlight the fact that the Commission did not adopt the conservation movement's agenda in reaching its conclusions. Indeed, the Commission has remained at arms' length from all parties to the protracted national dispute over forest policy. Nevertheless, it has found nothing to commend the Forest Conservation and Development Bill, and has proposed a comprehensive and realistic alternative which would seem to the Democrats to be a substantial step forward towards ecologically sustainable management of our native forests. Accordingly, I look forward to this evening's debate and to the Opposition joining with the Democrats to defeat this very flawed legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The final three volumes of the report of the Resource Assessment Commission are substantial by any assessment that any person might make. Mr Justice Stewart, the Chairperson of the RAC, suggests in his preface that it was clear from the outset that the Commission's task was demanding and complex. He said that never had such a wide-ranging inquiry into forest and timber matters been commissioned before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view this report debunks a few of the popular theories about forestry in Australia; for example, the definition of old growth forests. The report says that there is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes old growth forests and that the inquiry had attempted to clarify the use of the term. The report then went on to recommend that the use of the term old growth be reserved for forests that are both negatively disturbed and ecologically mature and have high conservation and intangible values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That definition will put into perspective the countless dozens of forests that conservation groups like to term old growth. But the Resource Assessment Commission also supports continuation of timber production. The Commission also made the point that, on its definition, very few forests can be classed as old growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also suggested in the report that all forest management agencies have in place sustained yield management strategies. This is not the view of conservationists; it is the view of the Commission at an inquiry regarded as the most comprehensive yet undertaken, so it must be given a great deal of credence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry also acknowledges that plantation forestry will come on-stream under normal marketing conditions. That is something that we must all understand. In talking about plantations, the report also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless the community is prepared to accept significant dislocation of regional industry and employment it will not be feasible to accelerate the replacement of native hardwoods with softwood resources.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an argument that has been going on for quite some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as resource security is concerned, the inquiry was of the view that the Commonwealth Government's Forest Conservation and Development Bill&mdash;which we are going to debate later tonight&mdash;is largely irrelevant to the majority of producers in the forest industry since it applies only to projects worth more than $100m. In relation to resource security, the report states that, regardless of the possible passage of the Forest Conservation and Development Bill through the Senate, the inquiry's preferred approach to resource security is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to strengthen and revise agreements between forest management agencies and industry, particularly through the development of enforceable contracts that make clear provision for compensation.</PARA>
<PARA>That is something that we have been arguing about for quite some time. The report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Inquiry considers that governments should carefully consider a system of long-term rights incorporating periodic review. The question of Commonwealth involvement in these processes is best dealt with through the intergovernmental institutional arrangements proposed by the Inquiry. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Let me reiterate: the cessation of wood production activities in native forests is not justified on the basis of the evidence before the inquiry. While the inquiry stressed that additional research and forest assessment is required, and that forest management and monitoring must be carried out very rigorously, it concluded that all forest management agencies have in place sustained yield management strategies and that these strategies are appropriate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The forest and timber inquiry of the Resource Assessment Commission is undoubtedly the most thorough investigation that there has ever been on this matter. The appointment of Mr Justice Stewart made sure that the matter was going to be dealt with absolutely thoroughly, almost to the point of exhaustion. It is very heartening just to look over the list of witnesses who gave evidence. Anybody interested in the subject could not but be impressed by the list and be satisfied that the industry, the resource conservation groups, the academics, foresters, primary and secondary industries, scientists and ordinary people have all had an opportunity to make some input. I am sure that they will also agree that on the basis of the intensity with which Mr Justice Stewart customarily proceeds with these things the findings must be in accordance with the facts as he has put them together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We only have to look for half a moment at the position of Australian forestry today to see that something is wrong. Throughout the whole of the country the industry is in limbo. We have had bad government interference. We have had bad non-government interference. We have had bad legislation. Now we are left in a position where there is absolute and total uncertainty. There is no employment, no investment, no certainty of any description. The Bill before the House does not provide that either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It concerns me greatly that at a time like this when we have the Bill before us, even though the report has only been available for about three weeks, I have seen not one member representing the Government make one comment about it in any way, shape or form. It is not going to go away by not making comment about it. It is not reasonable to be trying to whack through second-rate legislation at a time when we have available to us the most valuable report that we have ever had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on the Government either to make some comment about its intentions as far as the report is concerned or withhold dealing with the legislation until there has been time to consider it. I do not think that that is an unreasonable request at all. The evidence that came before the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs in the course of dealing with the Bill a couple of weeks ago so closely resembles the main findings of this report that surely the Government must take it into account. It cannot ignore areas which happen to comprise the same evidence as was put before the Committee a few weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is important for the future of Australia and its regional areas. The Opposition wants to see resource legislation and it wants to see resource security. It needs to be as secure as it can possibly be. If the recommendations that were made in this report were taken into account and acted upon, there could be and would be security for the industry. We could then see such things proceed as the pulp mill in northern Tasmania that we have been talking about as well as works in other parts of Australia. We want to see them proceed but under this sort of legislation it is absolutely impossible. I would certainly be asking the Government to make some comments about the report and to incorporate the suggestions and conclusions of this report into the legislation in a form that could make it work. </PARA>

I suppose we all wondered why at the time these reports had been delayed; but not for long.

Our main criticism of the legislation is that it applies only to very large investments and that it left the small sawmillers&mdash;people trying to invest $30m, $40m or $50m&mdash;out in the cold with no security of resources at all. This report picks up that particular flaw in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the report says that, regardless of the possible passage of the Bill through the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Inquiry's preferred approach to resource security is to strengthen and revise agreements between forest management agencies and industry, particularly through the development of enforceable contracts that make clear provision for compensation.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, we have pressed very clearly the need for, at the very least, the abolition of the no compensation clause that the Government has in its legislation; and that if, at the very last minute, a piece of flora or fauna that is considered endangered is found, an additional resource be made available to take that place. How can we possibly expect any industry to invest large sums of money and then not give it the security of the resource it needs to make that investment work? How can we expect industry to invest when we tell it that if, at the very last minute when it goes in to use that resource, some flora or fauna is found, it will be denied that particular resource and it will not be offered any other resource or any compensation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Commission report comes down very clearly on the side of the Opposition, on the side of the amendments that we have been pushing for some time. As Senator Tambling said, every single person giving evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs&mdash;except those from the Government and the conservation groups&mdash;supported our amendments. It did not matter where they came from&mdash;the unions or industry&mdash;everyone supported our amendments and most said that the legislation was quite useless without them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As one of my colleagues said, I was a member of the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs which considered the Forest Conservation and Development Bill. In our minority report we pointed out that it would have been very nice to have had the Resource Assessment Commission report as part of the process of assessing the Bill. Nevertheless, we did not have the report. We came down very strongly, as has already been said, on trying to look after the concerns of the industry and the unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a fair amount of politics involved in this all the way through, as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, being a Tasmanian. At the conclusion of the Committee hearing examining this Bill I was rather heartened by some of the comments made by Senator Cook. Nevertheless, at the end of the day, there was nothing solid enough to make us change our opinion and, therefore, we presented this dissenting report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we have this Resource Assessment Commission report which was brought forward by Justice Stewart. As he said, never before had such a wide ranging inquiry been commissioned in relation to forest and timber matters in Australia. I have here only one of the three volumes of the report and I suggest that quite a few trees were involved in just putting the report together. It has taken three years to produce&mdash;it is almost as big as one of Cecil B. De Mille's epics, such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Ten Commandments</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the commandments are in here. The report justifies the stand we have taken and it justifies the need for security of resource for this very important industry. It points out that even with Australia's resources of timber and the plantation timber that is coming on stream, we export only about one-third of our forest harvest&mdash;mainly hardwood chips&mdash;and we run at a very significant balance of payments deficit in forest and timber products. In 1990-91, we exported only $596m worth of timber products, yet in that same period we imported in the vicinity of $1,928m worth. So we have a $1,332m deficit in that area and I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that that is something which needs to be corrected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As previous speakers have said, one of the key recommendations of the report concerns the need to guarantee the wood supply. The report also points out that, in relation to aspects of forest management, the inquiry was of the view that the private sector should make the decisions on the basis of its own assessment of commercial opportunities, risks and investment projects. In other words, it was suggesting that the Government butt out of the whole situation as much as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was quite interested to hear Senator Coulter's contribution to this debate. I suppose that when we have a report this big, we can expect everybody to put their own slant on it. As to his particular slant about the conservationists not being in favour, when I was looking through the report a while ago I noticed that it said that the conservation movement generally did not oppose the development of a vigorous forest and timber industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the Australian Conservation Foundation, though advocating an accelerated plantation program, was willing to accept native forestry harvesting until the year 2000. That also came through to us in the evidence we received. However, there was a fair amount of stretching of the truth. One thing that disturbed me about the whole thing was that, in my own State of Tasmania, it was put to me that the thylacine had become extinct because of logging operations; I believe that that is very hard to prove, as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter from the Premier of Western Australia, Dr Carmen Lawrence, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I regret that the Senate is misinformed. The delay in appointing Senator Chamarette resulted from an anomaly in the drafting of section 15 of the Australian Constitution. I suggest that the Senate might usefully turn its attention to that anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to draw attention to three features of Dr Lawrence's letter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I must state that the Senate was by no means misinformed when it expressed disapproval of the Western Australian Government's failure to provide electors of that State with their true and full representation for the opening of the autumn sitting of this Senate and the disrespect this afforded to the Senate. The Senate was certainly not misinformed regarding the failure of the WA Government to expeditiously fill the casual Senate vacancy of Senator Vallentine. On the contrary, it appears from her letter that the Premier herself was not fully informed as to what occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the facts regarding the delay in appointment are as follows. The Premier confirmed on 3 November 1991 her knowledge that Senator Vallentine intended to resign on 31 January 1992 and that, following a ballot, the Greens of Western Australia had nominated a successor, namely myself, to the State Government to follow Senator Vallentine when that casual vacancy arose. As recorded in the State <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 5 February 1992, when the official notification from the President of the Senate was transmitted to the Western Australian State Parliament, both upper and lower houses of the State Parliament were sitting. There was therefore nothing to prevent a joint sitting being called in order to proceed with the appointment. The most charitable interpretation that can be made is that it represented a failure of knowledge rather than a lack of political will on the part of the State Government not to proceed at that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, difficulties arise when Parliament has long gaps between sittings without being prorogued. Across the States there have been varied ways of interpreting section 15 of the Australian Constitution. Page 149 of Odgers' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS> presents the information that on at least three occasions in the past Western Australia has adopted a more liberal interpretation than it chose to adopt in this instance. Therefore, the anomaly which the Premier uses to justify the delay may well warrant the attention of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this reason I have presented notice of motion No. 758 to address the problem that States are not bound by any time limit in the filling of a vacancy. This is discussed on page 150 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS>. Unfortunately, the Opposition has not seen the importance of a time limit being recommended by the Senate to the States in order to expedite full State representation. Without this motion being declared formal, it is at risk of falling off the business agenda of this sitting of the Senate. I urge Opposition senators to reconsider their position on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude these comments with the hope that the letter from the Premier of Western Australia urging us to address this issue will encourage the Senate to make a recommendation to the States which can prevent this failure in democratic representation arising at some future time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a brief comment about Dr Lawrence's letter because I find it most extraordinary for it to be said that there been some anomaly in the drafting of the Constitution. The Constitution is crystal clear. Section 15 of the Constitution&mdash;the part which is particularly pertinent to the issue at hand&mdash;states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But if the Parliament of the State is not in session when the vacancy is notified, the Governor of the State, with the advice of the Executive Council thereof, may appoint a person to hold the place until the expiration of fourteen days from the beginning of the next session of the Parliament of the State or the expiration of the term, whichever first happens.</PARA>
<PARA>There are options open that Dr Lawrence refused point blank to act upon. This saw Senator Chamarette sitting in the wilderness for quite some time. I think the point is that not only has the State Government goofed on this once but it has now goofed on it twice. The Parliament was not in session when the vacancy actually occurred, but it was in session when it was notified of the vacancy. It was in session after Senator Chamarette had effectively taken over&mdash;she had not been sworn in&mdash;after former Senator Vallentine had disappeared from the scene. The Parliament did have an opportunity. For Dr Lawrence to say that the Senate is misinformed is the absolute height of hypocrisy. Dr Lawrence should read the Constitution and have her Executive Council understand it. It would be helpful if she, as Premier of Western Australia, also understood the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to direct some of my comments to what Senator Chamarette said about the Opposition's support for her notice of motion. I suggest to Senator Chamarette that the Opposition has supported her position right from day one. We have not baulked at that fact. We thought that a grave injustice was done to her by the Western Australian Labor Government. Those few people who support her are nonetheless still entitled to their voice in the Senate. I would suggest that Senator Chamarette, instead of trying to beat us about the head, should try to look at this Government, which is the same political colour as the Government in Western Australia, to see whether it will see reason&mdash;</PARA>

While we got more votes at the last election, we are still not in government. I am the first to recognise how frustrating it is to have more votes at an election and still not be in government. If, on the basis that we did get more votes at the last election, Senator Chamarette is asking us to change the world, I suggest that she get her supporters to vote for a Hewson government at the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to direct some of my remarks to what has been said by Senator Knowles about political blame. There is always a tendency in these matters to seek some sort of political conspiracy as to why things occur. Governments are organisations which take advice from their legal officers. My understanding of what happened in the case of the Western Australian Government is that it received advice from its Crown Law Department that the procedure it entered into was the proper procedure. That advice may not be right, but a government in receipt of that advice is bound to pay attention to it. If it did not, I can well imagine that the political supporters of Senator Knowles in Western Australia would belabour the Lawrence Government, in the context of all that is going on in the Royal Commission in that State, for ignoring the advice of the Crown Law Department and the legal officers who are retained for the purposes of giving that advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not see a political conspiracy in all of this, I do not see any desire to disadvantage anyone, but I see a desire to try to understand the correct procedures.

I quite understand that because we have not had a chance to debate it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the facts are as I presented them to the Senate. It is very difficult actually to alter the Constitution in such a way as to rectify the anomaly that has been used to justify the delay. There is a much easier path and that is the one that I have proposed in my notice of motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three points in the notice of motion. First, it addresses the need for casual vacancies to be filled expeditiously so that States have their full representation. Secondly, there is a need to recognise that there may be a difficulty in the interpretation of section 15 of the Constitution. Thirdly and finally, there is a recommendation that all State parliaments adopt procedures whereby their Houses, if they are adjourned when a casual vacancy in the Senate is notified, are recalled to fill the vacancy, and whereby the vacancy is filled within 14 days after the notification of the vacancy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further anomaly arises in relation to the Constitution in that a motion to fill a vacancy has to be followed by a joint sitting within 14 days if notification occurs when Parliament is sitting. There is an elastic period between notification and actually putting a motion for a joint sitting. This interpretation of the Constitution has allowed the State Government to delay its appointment and to be rendered powerless to fill the vacancy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have requested that my notice of motion be treated as a formal motion. I have received support from the Government and the Democrats. But the Opposition has expressed the view that unless only the word `expeditiously' is used and unless there is no time limit, it will not accept the motion as formal. I merely took the opportunity to point out that this motion actually addresses the concern that Dr Lawrence is raising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People may feel concerned that the Senate is not in a position to make recommendations to the States as to how they should act. I believe that this letter gives us a full invitation to do so.

<PARA>I wish to say a few words about report No. 27 of 1991-92. This project audit report by the Auditor-General on the Retirement Benefits Office deals with the effectiveness of the information campaign which was conducted by the Retirement Benefits Office in 1990-91. That information campaign stemmed from the changes to superannuation provisions applying to the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 July 1990 a new superannuation scheme for public servants&mdash;the public sector superannuation scheme or PSS scheme&mdash;was introduced. Eligible persons were given 12 months to elect to transfer to the new scheme or to remain with the existing scheme&mdash;the Commonwealth superannuation scheme or the CSS. During this period the Retirement Benefits Office conducted an extensive information campaign to assist members in their choice&mdash;namely, whether to stay with the existing Commonwealth superannuation scheme or whether to move across to the new scheme. As I said in my initial remarks, the Australian National Audit Office, as outlined in audit report No. 27, undertook to report on the effectiveness of that information campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it has not been possible to examine the report in detail. But, in summary, the audit report discloses that although the information campaign was generally effective in providing members with sufficient information to enable them to make an informed transfer decision, some categories of members received unreliable information owing to shortcomings in members' contribution records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were also some problems in respect of that part of the campaign related to the development by the Retirement Benefits Office of what was called a ready reckoner, which was a personal computer program on disc designed to permit members to project their benefits under each scheme. There were apparently a number of errors in the first version of that ready reckoner and that, of course, detracted from its usefulness. The second version was due for release in November 1990 but it was not in fact issued until April 1991, which was just two months prior to the end of the year during which contributors to the Commonwealth superannuation scheme had to elect whether to stay or whether to change to the new Public sector superannuation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also found by the Auditor-General that information leaflets designed to provide guidance to members were not properly checked and edited. As a result, the examples in some leaflets which were intended to assist with the choice were in fact misleading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's report brings up some specific criticisms of the exercise conducted by the Retirements Benefits Office. As I understand it, the Retirement Benefits Office has accepted and is proposing to take action on the majority of the recommendations that the Audit Office has made in report No. 27 to prevent such an outcome occurring in future. Hopefully the recommendations also relate to the provision of information by the Audit Office in terms of its own record system, which does not have the unreliability that some of the existing information was found to have when this matter was being examined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to say too much more about it other than to point out that at the recent Estimates hearings the Department of Finance told Estimates Committee B that 69 per cent of Commonwealth superannuation scheme members had been expected to transfer across to the new public sector scheme but that in fact only 37 per cent have actually done so. That is a very significant difference between expectation and actuality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This much lower than expected rate of transfer is no doubt due, at least in part, to the errors in the information and the late information to which the Audit Office has drawn attention and to which I have already referred. I think that is unfortunate. I think it is a matter that we in the Senate ought to be looking at in greater detail. An opportunity to do that will occur at the next Estimates hearings following the next Budget. But that is a small comfort for those contributors who may have not elected to change schemes on the basis of unreliable information. The Auditor-General's report is very salutary in drawing attention to those difficulties and one would certainly hope that the Retirement Benefits Office in future will not be subject to the same criticism as it was on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also very briefly take this opportunity to comment on the recent retirement of the director of the Retirement Benefits Office, Mr Geoff Vanthoff, who has retired after a very long Public Service career which stretches back into the late 1940s. He has been a very senior officer in a variety of senior and important Public Service positions over those decades and I take this opportunity to publicly congratulate him on the contribution he made to the various positions he occupied over those many years and to wish him well in his retirement. </PARA>

<PARA>The Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure welcomed the opportunity to conduct an inquiry into proposals to develop rocket launching facilities in Australia. Rocket launching was once a field of activity in which Australia ranked only second to the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1947 Woomera became operational as a guided weapons testing range and Australia, with the United Kingdom, tested a variety of rockets at the range. In 1957 the United States also established a presence there to support its Mercury manned space missions. From 1961 the European Launcher Development Organisation, ELDO, used Woomera for its launching activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia launched its WRESAT satellite from Woomera in 1967 and thereby became only the third nation to launch a satellite from its own soil. By the late 1970s, for a variety of reasons, Woomera declined as a centre for space related activities, having in its heyday been the world's most heavily used space launching facility apart from Cape Canaveral.  Australia has, nevertheless, been involved in the satellite tracking industry for nearly 35 years and its expertise now in space technology for communications and remote sensing is widely recognised. Apart from that, Australia is not regarded as a leading participant in space-related activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, however, in an increasing number of countries, a growing recognition that there are substantial benefits to be gained from space industry endeavours. It is therefore encouraging to see that there is an acceptance of this fact in Australia and that proposals are coming forward to develop the country's space-related capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals to develop satellite launching services on Cape York Peninsula and Woomera are positive steps. The Cape York service is intended for equatorial launches of payloads into geo-stationary orbit while the Woomera proposal is to provide launches of small satellites for communications, global positioning and remote sensing into low earth or polar orbit. The Committee's report deals in detail with the proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also addressed the role of government in the development of launching services, the space industry and other aspects relevant to Australia's approach to space matters. It is generally acknowledged that the world market for the provision of launch services is very competitive and that there is no launching service which is not either government owned or heavily government subsidised. Given this situation, and while accepting that the decision to develop any Australian launch service ultimately rests with the proponents, there will be a continuing role for government participation in the Australian development of such services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has commended the roles of the South Australian and Queensland governments for assisting the respective launching services proposals in those States. As the report shows, there are legislative, regulatory and international negotiation responsibilities for the Commonwealth Government in progressing the development of the proposals. In addition, the Committee considers there are other forms of assistance the Government should examine and the recommendations in its report are directed to this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has welcomed the proposals for developing launching services and considers that if further studies by their proponents confirm them to be viable undertakings they will be a valuable addition to promoting and expanding Australia's space-related activities and industry. I take this opportunity to convey my appreciation to all the people who gave the Committee their assistance throughout the conduct of the inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Developing Satellite Launching Facilities in Australia and the Role of Government</EMPHASIS>, which has just been tabled by the Chairman of that Committee, is the product of 12 months work by this Committee and its supporting secretariat. As Deputy Chairman of the Committee, I want to place on record my thanks to the Committee Secretary, Mr Tony Magi, and all those associated with the general work and research undertaken by the Committee in regard to this particular inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terms of reference for the inquiry were advertised in April last year in newspapers with a nationwide coverage and in several regional newspapers in Queensland. Invitations for submissions were also made to companies, associations and individuals participating in the space industry and those involved in space-related activities. The Australian Government and the State governments of Queensland and South Australia were also invited to participate, especially due to our interest in the Woomera and Cape York space sites. In all, 36 submissions and several supplementary submissions were received by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Committee commenced its program of inquiry in early July last year with an inspection of the coastal and inland area around Temple Bay on Cape York Peninsula. At the time of the inspection Temple Bay and its hinterland was the only publicly declared preferred site for the possible development of a rocket launching facility by one of the two proponents of the Cape York launching service. The Committee also held public hearings in Cairns in July, followed by hearings in Brisbane and Sydney. In August the Committee received a private briefing from the Australian Space Office in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Hearings were also held in Adelaide in October, followed by an inspection of the British Aerospace Australia facilities at Technology Park in South Australia and that company's space manufacturing facility within the Defence Science and Technology Organisation site at Salisbury close to Adelaide. The Committee also visited Woomera for a briefing and inspection of installations, rocket launching areas and instrumentation buildings in the town. Another hearing was held in Brisbane, followed by hearings in Canberra in November which concluded our hearings on this inquiry. In all, some 78 witnesses appeared before the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major conclusion reached by the Committee is that a high priority must be given to reviewing what Australia's future attitude and approach will be as a participant in space related activities. The Committee also recognised that there is a growing recognition in an increasing number of countries that an involvement in space endeavours will bring substantial benefits. It is, therefore, important that the Commonwealth Government take a leadership role on space matters to determine a national strategy and to implement positive measures which will provide direction, impetus and assistance for the indigenous space industry to develop in a cohesive manner. To achieve this goal it is important that all sectors of the Australian space community and potential participants are consulted and, if the Government fails to adopt this approach, its lack of commitment to space related developments will be clearly shown at both local and international levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals to develop commercial launching services located at Woomera and Cape York are at the stage where their commercial viability has not yet been firmly established. The final decisions on whether to proceed with the developments will be up to the commercial judgments made by the respective proponents. The Committee is of the view that this will not take place without some form of support from governments, and that is particularly so in regard to the proposals for the Cape York space base. It may well be that the Woomera proposals have a much greater chance of getting off the ground successfully without the need for any significant government involvement or intervention. However, I am very sceptical as to whether, in fact, anything can occur at Cape York without significant government involvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is on that basis that the Committee made eight recommendations relating to the development of satellite launching facilities and these were supported by all members of the Committee. The recommendations relate to the satellite launch vehicle project, the South Australian Woomera rocket range and the Scramjet project, which I believe is the most exciting project that is currently under way concerning the development of space facilities and space projects in Australia. From all the evidence that we took it seemed to me that strong emphasis should be given to the development of this particular technology for the launching of space facilities. Of course, this is particularly relevant to the Woomera location because the Scramjet project relates to the launch of low level satellites for communication purposes. This technology and this project offer the best opportunity for Australia to become more actively involved in a space program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were also recommendations with regard to the role of Commonwealth bodies, the legislative and regulatory framework that will be required, third party insurance liability, the establishment of a national space council and government assistance for the space industry. The Committee also recommends that if current industry assistance schemes are found to discourage or inhibit space industry development proposals, they should be reviewed and, furthermore, that such reviews should not be confined to the space industry, but should be conducted to encourage development proposals from other industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems clear to the Committee that it is unlikely that Australia has the opportunity to become significantly involved in the development of a space industry without substantial government involvement, particularly in terms of purchasing payload provisions for the launch of rockets especially in regard to the Cape York base proposal. It is really up to the government of the day to make a final judgment about whether it really believes that its involvement in the space industry is of general benefit to the Australian community and is in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general conclusion of the Committee was that there certainly were substantial benefits to be gained by Australia becoming more actively involved in the space industry. Therefore, I would urge the present Government and future governments to give very serious consideration to the way in which they could become involved in assisting that development. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure on developing satellite launching facilities in Australia and the role of the Government. I am a member of the Senate Standing Committee and, at a personal level, I found that the evidence we received was fascinating. In particular, I want to make a few remarks about the proposals that affect my own State of South Australia about which Senator Foreman and Senator Chapman, who are also South Australian Senators, have also commented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, credit should be given to an organisation called Australian Launch Vehicles, which is based in South Australia. That company took the initiative to start a proposal to reactivate Woomera as a launching site for low orbiting satellites. The company approached me as a South Australian Senator even before this inquiry started and asked for support. It outlined the possibilities concerning the Motorola Iridium program and the possibility that some of the Motorola satellites could be launched from Woomera. Unfortunately, that possibility did not eventuate and the main reason for that was that even though technically the preparation of the proposal from Australian Launch Vehicles was very good, in the end Motorola declined to put the consortium through to the final list because it could not actually demonstrate a launch vehicle, that is, it did not have a workable rocket. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the evidence that we received about Woomera it was clear that the bottom line is that, to get the project off the ground&mdash;if Senators will pardon the pun&mdash;the Australian Government or governments will have to, as an article of faith, put up money for the design and construction of two rockets and launch them from Woomera with a scientific payload. CSIRO has indicated plenty of interest, and has plenty of ideas as to how it could use a rocket to launch a low orbiting satellite for some of its research. However, the total cost of that will be in excess of $30m and in these times of tight budgetary constraints all governments will cough a bit when they see that sort of figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we really are serious&mdash;and the Committee's report shows that Australia should be very serious&mdash;about being involved at an appropriate level in space technology, that sort of contribution will have to come forward. If it is successful and if Australia can establish a facility at Woomera to launch a range of low orbiting satellites, the benefits to Australia in terms of technology and employment will be enormous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a particular interest in the communications side. The Motorola program raises the issue of new communications technology. In the latter part of this decade and into the next century the emphasis will be not so much on geostationary satellites stationed 30,000 kilometres above the earth in a permanent position but on many low orbiting satellites at only 100, 200 or 400 kilometres above the earth's surface&mdash;a whole network of them continually moving in orbit around the earth, always having one over head and, therefore, always being able to be contacted. The view is that with those low orbiting satellites a message from a mobile telephone device will be able to go direct to the satellite without a dish and then be transmitted anywhere in the world to another telephone. Apparently, the market for such devices is very big indeed. In the maritime area, in the civil aviation area, in remote areas of the world on land and in mining companies exploring in remote areas, there is a strong desire by all to have access to that sort of communication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that our report dealing with Woomera shows a real opportunity, but I admit that it has a $30m price tag. I also commend the Australian Space Office for putting forward further money this year, with the South Australian Government and the consortium of firms based in South Australia, to do a further definition study on the possibility of getting small satellites launched from South Australia. That report will come down in the latter part of this year and it may be that at that time State and Federal governments will have to be asked to contribute the sort of money it will take to get a couple of rockets launched. I, like Senator Chapman, have wider doubts, though, about the possibility of the Cape York venture taking place. The investment there would be massive, running into many hundreds of millions of dollars. Whether the Cape York option is a goer commercially is, in my view, more debatable than the Woomera option which needs much less investment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I do not want to start a cross-debate between the Australian Democrats and Queensland Liberal senators over the environment of the Cape York Peninsula. I am no expert, but in both the Cape York and Woomera regions one has to admit there are environmental concerns; Aboriginal land rights and claims cannot be ignored. But, all up, the proposal for Woomera seems to me to be a better chance for us. I think Senator Chapman is right: in the end, to get the Cape York Peninsula launch site operational will require a very substantial government investment in infrastructure. I do not think we need anywhere near that investment to get Woomera operational.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Irrespective of that, I believe the report and the evidence we received shows that there is a considerable interest in Australia, in both the private and public sectors, in the need for us to be involved in space research and technology and that Australia should make the commitment&mdash;a commitment I support&mdash;to invest the money to get ourselves back to being not a major player but a modest although significant player in space research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to the Committee, chaired by Senator Foreman, and to the secretariat for their diligent research work, much of which was quite technical, in helping us to prepare what I hope will become a benchmark report for the future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a senator who was a member of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure until October 1991 but a member when the majority of evidence relating to the Cape York proposal was heard, I congratulate the Committee on what is a fair and balanced report. I am not opposed to the development of a spaceport on Cape York as long as I can be convinced that the concerns of the Aboriginal communities and the environmental considerations there are all taken into account. That is leaving aside the whole question of the economic viability which, as this report says, is very questionable at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I focus for a moment on what is happening with the STS consortium and the notion of preferred developer status which it has had conferred on it by the Queensland Government. The Committee has been particularly thorough here in updating the information in this section: pages 48 to 53. We were told by former Queensland Premier, Mr Mike Ahern, at our hearing back in July last year, `Any minute now, within two weeks, we are going to be able to tell you who is going to come to the aid of STS; there is going to be a huge Australian injection of capital into this</PARA>
<PARA>project'. I thought that that sounded a very exciting possibility. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator KERNOT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not knocking it. Then we were told that this preferred developer status would have to reach its first milestone by December and tell us where the finance would be coming from. It was to obtain $20m by the end of December 1991. This milestone was not met. The Committee was then informed by STS in February 1992 that, although that milestone had not been reached, arrangements were being finalised with a Euro-American financial syndicate for the funding of the project.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am making the point that we have been told time and time again that an announcement about Australian backing in this project is imminent, and it just has not eventuated. We really have to ask the Queensland Government why it continues to give preferred developer status to STS when there is another consortium, headed by another former Queensland Premier, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, which claims that it can put the deal together. I find it one of those delicious ironies of Queensland politics that we have two former National Party Premiers competing in consortia to fund the spaceport proposal. However, I think it really suits the political purposes of the Premier of Queensland to make it appear that this project is bubbling along nicely whereas in fact I do not think that is the case at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the Committee recommendation on page 53 that if a Cape York spaceport proposal is to proceed a high priority must be given by the proponents to consultations on a regular basis with the Aboriginal communities affected by this spaceport. I also support the endorsement of Senator Chapman of the Scramjet project, which is mentioned on page 109 of the report. This is a project developed out of the University of Queensland. I have been out to the university. I have seen the wind tunnel developed by Professor Stalker and his team there. I have seen the prototype of the Scramjet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has always seemed to me that we have here an absolute prime example of something which could benefit from the attention of the task force which this Government has set up&mdash;a task force on the commercialisation of Australian research. We have the example here of an Australian firm with the leading edge internationally in this technology, and it has been unable to find $1m of government support to take it to the next stage. I think we in this country should acknowledge that there is a structural problem, a lack of development capital, but this is a very worthwhile project which I would like to see the Government support. I commend the report. It recommends that:</PARA>

<PARA>I agree with previous speakers who have concluded that there is much to be gained from responsible forays into space technology. The scramjet is an obvious way to begin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the work of the secretariat. We had some enjoyable times; we had some informative times. For someone such as Senator Macdonald to trust a Democrat at the wheel of a light aircraft was a unique experience for me.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to direct my remarks mainly towards the Cape York space launch facility proposal. Before doing so, I join with my colleagues who were on the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure in thanking all of those people who gave evidence and who spent quite some time and, obviously, money in preparing evidence and making submissions. The Senate committee system can function only because people take the time and effort to inform and advise members of those committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to all of those who made submissions to this Committee. Some of those who made submissions to us, at quite considerable cost to themselves, have, like many people throughout Australia's history, had an idea, put a lot of money into it and, regrettably, it has gone nowhere. Some of us on the Committee who have never been in business and have never had to invest money in a project cannot always understand what it is like to have a dream, put millions of dollars into it, find that it goes nowhere and have that dream shattered. Some of the people who appeared before the Committee were in that category. I thank them for what they have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very highly qualified aeronautical engineer&mdash;I think that is what he was&mdash;who gave evidence to us in Adelaide did so as an unemployed engineer. He is the sort of person that Australia cannot do without. He is without a job at present. I suspect that that is because the incentive to go ahead, to take risks and invest money has gone out of this country. It is a shame that that talent, that quality, is sitting there, unable to be employed, because of the way the Government has organised the economy in Australia in recent times. There is just no work for those sorts of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of positive things came out of the inquiry. I commend the Australian Launch Vehicle organisation and the South Australian Government for the work that it has done in relation to getting Woomera going again, with the low orbit jets. I, like Senator Kernot, was particularly interested in the scramjet proposal being developed by a private consortium in Queensland, in conjunction with the University of Queensland. It is a very exciting project and one that I hope will proceed. I commend to the Government the recommendations we have made in our report along that particular line. We made recommendations about the establishment of a national space policy council. There was quite a lot of evidence and discussion amongst the Committee on what Commonwealth organisations or advisory bodies should be involved. Again, I hope that the Government will look at that and very seriously consider some of the matters that came before the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a little disappointed that my Queensland colleague, Senator Kernot, appears to be knocking the project&mdash;she denied that in response to my interjection. Sometimes it seems to me that we always emphasise the bad aspects: the difficulties, the problems, timetables not being met and where the money is coming from. Those are the things which seem to be highlighted, rather than what I would have hoped from my Queensland colleague. I hoped for a bit of encouragement, a bit of enthusiasm, a bit of saying, `Well, you might not have all of the t's crossed and the i's dotted, but good on you, keep going, get ahead. How can we help?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of the Aborigines and the environment were mentioned. They are problems that need to be addressed. They took a prominent role in all of the submissions that came before us. I am sure that they will be properly addressed at the appropriate time. I believe that in nearly every case it is an issue that governments should look after and that it should not be left to private developers. In relation to the Cape York project, it is very difficult for the developers to have to go out and make the arrangements, make the ground rules, with environmentalists and Aboriginal groups. Very often, the guidelines are not even there. At times, it is very difficult to know who you should be making the agreements with. I urge the Federal Government and the Queensland Government to take on a more up-front role in determining the issues relating to Aboriginal heritage and environmental matters and not leave them all to private developers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the way through our deliberations, when we were talking about the Cape York space base, it was emphasised by all those talking to us that this was to be a private enterprise organisation; it was a commercial organisation. Some of my colleagues who have spoken before me have cast some doubts&mdash;regrettably and in a negative way&mdash;upon whether that project will go ahead without massive government support. The people who appeared before us were at pains to say that it was entirely commercial. There are differences in definition of what is `entirely commercial' and I might mention some of them a little later. It was intended to be a project with minimum government interference, minimum government involvement and minimum government money. It was to be directed and advanced by private capital from people who were prepared to take the risk and be entitled to the rewards if the project succeeded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer more specifically to the Cape York space base, without in any way down playing the other aspects of our report and the enormous amount of good work, evidence and examinations that the Committee and its members were involved in. The inquiry and report originated from a suggestion by my colleague Senator Panizza with respect to satellite communications and how they might help, particularly with telephone communication in the outback. That was the impetus for the report. It then became a very detailed examination into all aspects of the space industry, particularly looking at satellite launching facilities in Woomera and Cape York. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the evidence came out, it became quite clear that both of those proposals were not competing; they were complementary. They related to different launches. Using very basic terms, one was a very high launch in a geostationary orbit and the other was a low earth orbit. They were looking at different markets and different users. Both could complement each other. In fact, once we get a space industry going, the expertise, learning and material we gather from that will help the space industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cape York proposal was an initiative of the Queensland Government in 1987 when the Government called for expressions of interest. From there a lot of work was done. The basic part of the proposal for a Cape York space base was in relation to the use of a Russian Zenit rocket to launch it. The payload would be the payload of the customer who was organising it. A lot of work was done on the commercial viability of the proposal. The original front-runner on it, Cape York Space Agency Pty Ltd, did a detailed series of figures showing how it could be commercially adopted. A competitor in the activity on Cape York, Space Transportation Systems Ltd&mdash;STS&mdash;is now the preferred operator in that area. As I say, both of them have given a lot of thought to the money needed and the commercial reality of their proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As recently as earlier this month, and as our report says on page 51, an international consortium consisting of groups of companies from Holland, the United States and the United Kingdom was looking at wanting to get involved in STS's proposal for Cape York. They are obviously the people with the money. I can only encourage them to proceed with what I see is a very exciting and far-sighted project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should the Cape York space base go ahead, the benefits to Australia and Queensland will be absolutely enormous. In the area that I come from in north Queensland it will mean a new direction for our higher education places such as the James Cook University, and the proposed university campuses in Cairns and Brisbane. There will be new industry build-up. It will provide a lot of work for engineering places. I specifically mention the NQEA&mdash;North Queensland Engineers and Agents&mdash;a company in Cairns that has done a lot of work on the space project. It is a company that is involved in high tech manufacturing of that order, and a company that could well do a lot towards developing a space base in the cape and do it very well and at world best standards. It is a project that would give enormous benefits to north Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At page 70 there are some particulars from NIEIR, which is a research institute, of what a space base in Cape York could mean to Australia. It suggests that the added GDP could be $430m in 1988 dollars. It could bring about a reduction in the current account deficit of $184m in 1988 dollars. The added employment to Australia, a matter that is very important in this day and age with one million unemployed, could be in the range of 4,500 jobs in fairly high technology industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst these are to be commercial activities, they do require the support of governments in the way of foreign contracts, and treaties with the Russians and the Americans in relation to the transfer of technology. In general, with the rules of operating in space, these things can only be done at a government level so, of course, whatever happens with Australia's space industry, there will need to be government regulation there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, many people suggest that if a new industry is started in somewhere like Brisbane or Sydney it will already be taking advantage of a huge government infrastructure in roads, water, sewerage and transport facilities which a group that is setting up a greenfields industry does not have to pay for if it goes into those areas. Some submissions put to us, with which I agree, suggested that in the case of an establishment in the Woomera or Cape York areas, there would be a reasonable argument for asking the Government to look at helping in the way of some infrastructure assistance&mdash;not direct grants on the commercial viability of it, but help in the infrastructure that could be expected if a new industry was being set up in other places in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I enthusiastically support the renewal of a space industry in Australia, irrespective of whether it operates out of Woomera, Cape York or anywhere else. I am enthusiastic about the proposals that came before us, both from ALV and STS. I certainly hope that they continue. Those companies are prepared to take risks and invest their money. If they succeed, it will be of enormous benefit to Australia and that is what I am interested in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government can help. I congratulate Senator Button for his very positive attitude towards this issue so far. I urge him to continue that positive support. I offer any assistance I can give to anything he or the Government may do in that way. I also recognise that Queensland governments, both past and present, continue to offer support, as does the South Australian Government. That is very good to see. They deserve recognition and they certainly have my appreciation. I commend the report to the Government and urge the Government to accept the recommendations positively. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this late stage before dinner I am very happy to support the recommendations of the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Developing Satellite Launching Facilities in Australia and the Role of Government</EMPHASIS>. When the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure finished the VFT inquiry, we were casting around for a new reference. At various stages I had spoken to the previous shadow Minister for transport and communications in this place, Senator Richard Alston, about my desire to provide better communication facilities for outback Western Australia&mdash;indeed, I suppose I should include all the Australian outback.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston mentioned one evening when we were talking together that satellites would be a good reference to consider the next time we were looking for a reference for the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. So probably the honour for getting this recommendation up started with Senator Richard Alston. I took the matter to the Committee where three or four other references were mooted. I must also thank Senator Peter Walsh, who happened to back mine. So away we went and got the reference up. Having thanked all those honourable senators for their support, I am very happy to be speaking about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, my interest lay in being able to provide Australia with regular and reliable communications in the outback. Safety is a prime reason for having such communication systems, as are commercial reasons involving mineral exploration and the pastoral areas. I always knew and believed that satellites are the only way that we will provide communications for every square metre of Australia. Geostationary satellites can provide that direct communication but, unfortunately, it comes at a cost. These days, people can have completely mobile telephones with just a disc on the top of their cars, but it comes at around the $50,000 or $60,000 mark. We have to look at other cheaper ways to provide communication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Schacht mentioned, the Iridium project was developed. Instead of having one big geostationary satellite, a band of satellites was used at a much lower cost. Basically, it consists of 77 light satellites in a polar route&mdash;in other words, going from south to north&mdash;with 7 bands of 11 across rotating around the world. In other words, they are not geostationary. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the suspension of the sitting, I was explaining to the Senate how the Iridium project will work with the low-band light satellites. That will lead us towards personal communications which will be a feature of the future. Rather than having a telephone with one number in a house all the time, we will carry a number with us anywhere within Australia, or within the world for that matter. That will come in time. The Iridium project with the low-band satellites will give a lot of competition to the optic fibre system. The optic fibre system is relatively new in world technology, but this is probably the first project on the horizon that will give it any competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to Woomera which the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure spent a day visiting. The Committee spoke to witnesses in Adelaide and then spent a full day out at Woomera. I believe that Woomera does have a future; more so with the Iridium project since the satellites will have to follow the polar route. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While at Woomera I was very impressed with the existing facilities, although they may be a little run down. The Government has to look at the idea of bringing back to suitable standard that which belongs to the Commonwealth. Certainly I was impressed with what has been left. I am sure that at some stage, with the facilities that were there, Australia would have been amongst the world leaders of satellite launching. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Cape York is suitable for the equatorial route&mdash;it could also be used for the polar route&mdash;its future lies mainly in launching the heavier satellites, the geostationary satellites, which cost much more. That is where the big money will be for Australian technology and Australian personnel who will be able to work there when it does get going, and I believe that it will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While in Adelaide I was impressed with the technology and the work being done by BAe there. I certainly did not think we had such advanced industry in satellite technology as exists in Adelaide. With BAe being in Adelaide, we have a certain amount of technology transferred to Australians, which is a very important consideration in any of these joint projects with overseas nations. I was very impressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has recommended that the Government look at some sort of support through either infrastructure or whatever for the Scramjet proposal. I believe that it is an Australian first and a world first and, fortunately, it results from Australian technology. I believe that in years to come we will see its benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do see a future for a proposed launching facility at Cape York. We have been told by an Australian Democrat senator that there will be environmental problems. But the environmental problems that the Democrats talk about will be found if it suits them whether they are at Cape York, Woomera or anywhere else. I do see a future for both of those places, especially Woomera, where a lot of the infrastructure has already been provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the big advantages of both places is that they are located in a country with a very stable government, which cannot be said about many other places on that particular route. There are not too many places in the world where one can launch satellites for the equatorial or the polar route. There are many considerations. Firstly, the satellites do not travel too far over populated areas and, secondly, the satellite route has to be within so many degrees of either the equator or the north-south meridian as the case may be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is very well placed both geographically and due to it having a stable government. I see a future for both those places. Mention has been made of a polar route for the satellites if the launching facility at Woomera is not proceeded with. The Albany-Esperance regions of Western Australia have been mentioned. Much as I would hate to see any of the infrastructure at Woomera fall into disuse, I would certainly support launching facilities in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank all the people who put submissions in front of the Committee in Canberra, Brisbane, Adelaide and Woomera. The submissions came mainly from very professional technology people. We heard from the environmentalists in Brisbane, mainly organised by Senator Kernot. I do wish to tell her that I quite enjoyed myself that day when we met with those environmentalists in Brisbane and questioned them to see whether they were dinkum in what they were saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also thank the secretariat for its work in putting the report together and in understanding the technological terms which were simplified in the report. Finally, I urge the Government to take up all the recommendations contained in the report. I believe that they are very sensible recommendations. Australia has a big future in space technology and satellite launching. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, there is a lot of money to be made should we put the right technology and facilities into place and should either this Government or any future government arrive at the right treaties with foreign countries that want to launch satellites from those areas. So I do hope that the Government takes up all of these recommendations. </PARA>

On report 314, the eight performance audits, under the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951, the Committee is required to examine all reports of the Auditor-General, including reports of efficiency audits. In report 314 the Committee examined eight reports of the Auditor-General covering the period May to November 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Auditor-General's reports cover a variety of programs and departments, including the Department of Veterans' Affairs; the Department of Employment, Education and Training; the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services; and the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As regards departmental responses to the Auditor-General's recommendations, the responses by departments to the Auditor-General's report and recommendations were encouraging with most of the recommendations being accepted by auditees. Only two matters are highlighted in the Committee's report as needing further attention, and both relate to the use of internal audit by government agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this matter of internal audit, the Committee notes that a major activity currently being undertaken by the Australian National Audit Office is the survey of internal audit in the Commonwealth public sector. The Auditor-General has reported on stage 1 of the survey with the second and final report expected in June of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The survey found that about 70 per cent of Commonwealth departments and agencies had internal audit units and that overall internal audit activity resulted in improved efficiency within departments. The Committee considers that internal audit activity is critical to the efficiency of a department and its accountability to Parliament, and has recommended in this report that new financial administrative legislation require that all Commonwealth organisations establish effective internal audit functions. A second recommendation relates to the need for the Department of Employment, Education and Training to strengthen its internal audit activity. I regret to note that we have commented on this matter previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the follow-up of the Auditor-General's reports, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts plays an important role in stimulating the efficient and effective use of public moneys through the scrutiny of the Auditor-General's reports and departmental responses to his recommendations. The Committee believes that systematic follow-up of performance audits by the Audit Office is an essential adjunct to the Committee's scrutiny of performance audit reports. The Committee in its Report No.296 made it clear that the Auditor-General should accept responsibility for the follow-up of his own recommendations. The Audit Office has accepted that recommendation, as has the Government by providing additional funds to the Audit Office for efficiency audits. The Committee notes with approval that the Audit Office has embarked on a program of follow-up audits, conducting four in 1990-91, and planning a further six in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now wish to comment on the Committee's 315th report&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Social Responsibilities of Commonwealth Statutory Authorities and Government Business Enterprises</EMPHASIS>. This report is the result of the Committee's investigation of how statutory authorities and government business enterprises&mdash;GBEs&mdash;measure and report to the public and the Parliament on the performance of their social responsibilities. The report also records the Committee's conclusion that most government agencies still have some way to go before they perfect the use of performance measures, and recommends ways in which this might be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now address the question of social responsibilities. Social responsibilities are defined in terms of the responsibilities of statutory authorities and GBEs towards their clients, their employees and the environment. Their responsibilities towards their clients include making their services as accessible as possible, having means available by which clients can provide input to the operations of statutory authorities, and by freedom of information. The social responsibilities of statutory authorities and GBEs towards their employees include equal employment opportunity, occupational health and safety, training, and industrial democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these responsibilities are imposed on statutory authorities, while others are undertaken by them on a voluntary basis. Whether they are legally required or voluntarily assumed, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts believes that the nation's statutory authorities and GBEs should act in accordance with the highest possible standards. The Committee recognises that there may be pressures on commercially oriented agencies to concentrate on their commercial performance at the expense of their social responsibilities. It is essential, however, that this does not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the social responsibilities to be included among corporate objectives, to ensure that government organisations act in a socially responsible manner and can demonstrate this to the public and the Parliament, the Committee is recommending social objectives be included among the corporate objectives of these organisations, and progress in meeting all these objectives to be reported in annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to measures and reports of performance, the Committee recommends that in making their reports, whether annual reports to the Parliament or reports for other purposes, statutory authorities and GBEs should compare performance with a standard or target; focus on the outcomes; use several indicators for each program, retaining the same indicators over a number of years so that changes over time can be monitored; choose information to suit the needs of the user; and use both qualitative and quantitative information. While recognising that there are limitations on the use of performance information, the Committee believes that agencies should strive for the best possible performance information and develop expertise among their staff in the development and use of performance information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's report provides detailed recommendations about the nature of the information that should be reported in relation to equal employment opportunity, training, access to services, activities that impact on the environment, and the activities of consultative groups, including those of statutory marketing authorities. A social responsibility summary is advocated by the Committee as a means by which each organisation can outline its progress and achievements in the performance of its social <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the topic of scrutiny of reports, requiring an organisation to define its social objectives and to measure and report on its performance focuses the organisation's attention on its social responsibilities. If its reports are scrutinised and regular responses provided, the pressure on the organisation to observe its social responsibilities is enhanced. Scrutiny of and providing response to its reports are therefore of the utmost importance, whether they are provided by Ministers, the Parliament and its committees, review bodies or the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the value of social responsibilities, the Committee also considered the means by which values could be attached to social responsibilities. This was a difficult task. The value of social responsibilities may be financial or non-financial. They are of value to individuals, the organisation providing them and the wider community, but their impact cannot always be fully assessed. Most of the information received by the Committee about the value of social responsibilities concerned the cost of providing them, particularly the cost of providing community service obligations, such as telephone and mail services to remote and isolated areas of the country. How the costing should be carried out has been determined by the Government in relation to Telecom's&mdash;the new AOTC's&mdash;provision of telephone services. The method of least avoidable cost is to be used and it is expected that other GBEs will use the same method. The Committee noted that criticism has been expressed about the validity of estimates of community service obligation costs. We recommend that the way in which estimates are made should be monitored and improvements sought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the more general level of dealing with the values and costs of socially responsible behaviour, the Committee endorses the use of cost-benefit analyses. Such analyses should consider both the quantifiable and qualitative aspects of any proposal and take as wide a view as possible of the impact of the proposal on the community and the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on the social responsibilities of Commonwealth statutory authorities and GBEs is important, and I suspect that in time it will prove to be of great significance. Both this report and report No. 314, which reviews eight of the Auditor-General's performance audits, focus on increasing the accountability of government agencies to the Parliament. I commend both reports to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report addresses the current operation of Medicare benefit fees under the Medicare schedule for radiological services and the restructure of the Medicare benefits arrangement for diagnostic radiology proposed by the Minister. The restructure proposes to amend sections of the current table for radiology services contained in the Medicare benefits schedule of the Health Insurance Act 1973. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, these amendments would create two separate categories of radiology practice&mdash;`comprehensive practices' and `other practices'. These would be categorised according to the number and type of modalities provided, the hours the radiologist works in each facility, and the attendance of the radiologist at the provision of certain items. Practices classified as `comprehensive' would receive 103.5 per cent of the current schedule fee for diagnostic radiology services, while practices classified as `other' and general practitioners providing radiology services would receive 75 per cent of the schedule fee. Although this would retain the existing fee for general practitioners, it would mean a drop of 25 per cent in the current fee for specialist radiologists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main proponents of the restructure&mdash;the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists, and the Australian Medical Association&mdash;are concerned that there has been a dramatic and unnecessary growth in plain diagnostic radiology services which places at risk the provision of affordable, high quality procedural radiology services to the community. They see the problem as basically twofold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current schedule is said to overcompensate practices providing only a limited range of diagnostic radiology services with low radiologist input and basic equipment. At the same time, it undercompensates practices providing a comprehensive range of procedural radiology services with substantial radiologist input and high-cost, state-of-the-art equipment. This is not only seen as a misallocation of Medicare benefits, but also is alleged to have allowed so-called entrepreneurial practitioners to overservice for financial gain, instead of providing services strictly for medical reasons. Compounding these concerns is the fear that overservicing and inadequate supervision by radiologists of services increases radiation exposure, and thereby poses risks for patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The restructure was based largely on the costing models of `comprehensive' and `other' practices defined by Coopers and Lybrand Consultants. These models were supposed to have shown the differing costs of practices, the disparity in remuneration under the current schedule between comprehensive and plain X-ray practices, and the need for adjustments to various items on the radiology table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes that the supposed problems behind the recent growth in radiology services have not been demonstrated conclusively, that the real reasons for this growth are more complex than the Department or College would admit, that the Coopers and Lybrand costing models are not representative of a range of practices, and that the proposed solutions have been insufficiently worked through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is not convinced that the growth in radiology services, as reflected in Medicare data, can be attributed simply to overservicing and the profiteering of so-called entrepreneurial practices. The evidence presented to the Committee suggested that a multiplicity of factors underlies the perceived expansion in radiology services. These factors range from population increase, demographic change, patient expectations, advances in imaging technology and the more technical/scientific approach of younger medical practitioners, to medico-legal defence concerns of doctors and cost-shifting from the State public health sector to the private health sector covered by Medicare. These factors were glossed over or downplayed by the proponents of the restructure, which suggests a less than thorough approach to this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trends of fairly recent origin, such as the higher incidence of sports injuries and the expansion of radiology services to cater for hitherto underserviced, if not unserviced, needs in lower socioeconomic areas have also contributed to the increase in radiology services. As these factors do not appear to have been taken fully into account, claims of overservicing may well be exaggerated and based on an inadequate understanding of recent developments. Furthermore, if overservicing does occur, legislation is already in place to take action against this practice. It is the responsibility of the Department to utilise this legislation effectively and promptly and to provide new legislation if the current provisions are deficient. The Committee does not believe that the proposed regulations are the most effective means of limiting unnecessary services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is not convinced that the restructure will result in improved radiological services for the community. We consider that there is a serious possibility that dated equipment will be purchased, and that complex services will be provided by inexperienced persons in order for `other practices' to qualify for `comprehensive practice' status. There are many reasons why `comprehensive practices' may not be the most effective and efficient providers of services at present. Comprehensive practices may, for instance, be encouraged to maintain businesses which are not needed. Evidence was also presented to the Committee which indicated that `comprehensive' type practices have been established in areas in order to win greater market share from rival practices, rather than to meet real community needs. The proposed restructure does not address such problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another likely repercussion of the proposed restructure is that there may be a serious decline in the availability of all types of diagnostic imaging services, especially for certain sections of the population. Currently, extended hours services may well be meeting a need. This need may exist because hospitals are busy or do not provide services after hours, or because other practices are not easily accessible in terms of transport, cost, or available hours. If `other' type practices, or marginal `comprehensive practices', either go out of business or charge higher fees in order to survive, other services may not change to meet real needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This highlights a number of major issues that need to be considered thoroughly if radiology services are to be restructured in a systematic and effective way. The Committee believes that the role of hospital services requires greater consideration, especially in terms of the extent of cost-shifting from State health systems to the Commonwealth and the extent to which patients are expected to use Medicare services in the community to obtain X-rays and other radiology services prior to admission to hospital. It is also necessary to clarify the involvement of general practitioners in radiology, especially in so far as they may provide essential services to rural and remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee emphasises that the consideration of these and other issues must take place within a planning context that allows for wider consultation than appears to have occurred in the preparation of the proposed restructure. It needs to be remembered that changes of the order envisaged under the restructure can have a substantial effect on the provision of services, on the viability of businesses, on the capacity of people to practise their profession, on the maintenance of health and on the operation of State hospital services including the attendance of private sector radiologists at such hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee therefore believes that the Medicare Benefits Consultative Committee, which provided the formal decision making context for the restructure, in future should publicise proposed changes widely. It should also accept written and oral comment on them so that groups other than radiologists have an opportunity to demonstrate the likely effect of changes and to question the evidence of those who may be seen to benefit most from change. While this may add to the time taken to effect changes, it is considered preferable to take such time as is required at this stage rather than have delays at a later stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, the Committee believes that, on the evidence and submissions provided, neither the Department nor the College has demonstrated an objective assessment of the issues. Consequently, the Committee is opposed to regulations which are based on information clearly biased towards one section of providers of medical services. The solutions suggested through the regulations could destroy business, deprive a number of communities of required services, exacerbate health problems and, overall, have a detrimental effect on the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has recommended that the Health Insurance (1991-1992 Diagnostic Imaging Services Table) Regulations (Amendment) be disallowed at this stage and that, to avoid any difficulties arising from the fact that the commencement date for the regulations is 1 May 1992, the Minister be asked to repeal the regulations. The Committee has also recommended that the Department undertake further research, that it consider any changes to radiology services in a wider context of health policy and flexible service provision, and that the Medicare Benefits Consultative Committee and the Department consult more widely on matters which impact on patients, State government services, medical practitioners and other professionals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three members of the Committee have presented a dissenting report stating that the cessation of bulkbilling for all persons, except pensioners and health card holders, would discourage the provision of unnecessary services and allow a reduction of waiting periods for those who require the services as a matter of necessity, and they have added a brief supporting statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the interesting facets of this inquiry into radiological services in relation to Medicare benefits is that two weeks ago all doctors in Australia were circulated with a 38-page booklet informing them of the changes that were to be implemented on 1 May before the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs brought down its report. The Department of Community Services and Health had adequate knowledge that this Committee was meeting. It was forewarned of the fact that there would be a delay in implementing the report. It showed scant regard for, or knowledge of, the processes of this chamber to expend those funds and promulgate the report and the effects of the regulations without in any way taking into account the findings of this Committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) deals with a wide range of issues and amendments to the taxation law. I will come back to some of these in more detail later. The purpose of the Bill is to make various amendments, including those flowing from the Government's industry statement of March 1991&mdash;not March 1992, but March 1991, more than a year ago. The amendments cover a very wide area ranging from depreciation provisions to anti-avoidance measures; roll-over relief; dividend rebates; deferral of deductions for trading stock purchases involving prepayments; amendments to the tax file number system; capital gains tax roll-over relief for partnerships so far as publishing indexation factors are concerned; the taxation of foreign sourced income; foreign exchange gains and losses; rehabilitation of mining, quarrying and petroleum sites; research and development; fringe benefits tax; education entry payment and one or two others. There are amendments covering 16 areas in total.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing about the Bill is that it has come in so late after the announcements by the Government, particularly so far as the amended depreciation provisions for capital equipment are concerned. I will come back to that later. The depreciation amendments are to give effect to the announcements made over a year ago on 12 March 1991 in the Government's industry policy statement. The Senate may recall that this statement was initially to be put out by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, but when the then Prime Minister Hawke saw his position as Prime Minister under threat, he moved in, took over the statement and was the main presenter of that statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the fact that that did not work and that as a result Prime Minister Hawke is no longer Prime Minister Hawke, the most significant element was that the amendments to which this Bill relates in the main were introduced that long ago. In many ways that is symptomatic of the malaise that we have in the taxation system in Australia today. We have enormous problems in the area of taxation. The taxation legislation and its regulations have grown over the past couple of decades from a mere few hundred pages to several thousand pages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1991 itself comprises 86 pages. The explanatory memorandum comprises 193 pages. If that were not bad enough, if such was the inefficiency with which this legislation was introduced, we now have from the Government no fewer than 16 major amendments to the original Bill. Although 16 perhaps sounds not all that much, in terms of complexity and comprehensiveness 11 pages of amendments are now required. So we have a continuing situation in the area of taxation legislation and, indeed, in many other areas of Government administration, of what would appear, at least at first blush, to be sheer administrative incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is absolutely unacceptable that we have a situation in Australia today&mdash;and we have had it for many years now&mdash;where we virtually have legislation by press release. The Government announces that changes will be made to this, that and the other, particularly in the area of taxation but also in a wider range of areas. It then puts out a press release. More often than not this is done during a time when Parliament is not sitting. So these announcements are made by way of ordinary press release and they do not come into the Parliament at all. Then we find that a year or more later legislation is introduced to give effect to the Government's decision at the time that the press release was put out. More often than not, we find that the legislation that is introduced does not accord in all respects with the press release that was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last couple of sitting weeks a minor Bill relating to amendments to superannuation was introduced into the House of Representatives. These amendments are consequential to changes which the Government made two years ago to principal legislation relating to public sector superannuation. It is only in the last two weeks that consequential legislation has been introduced to catch up with changes that were announced and made as long as two years ago. To a somewhat lesser extent, but nevertheless more significant in this respect, we have a similar situation with the legislation now before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in the accounting profession, and many others&mdash;particularly those who have to fill in taxation returns&mdash;know just how difficult and complex the area of taxation in Australia is today. It is almost impossible to know and to understand the complexities of taxation law. Even if one is a taxation expert, it is almost impossible to comply fully with all the requirements or not to make at least some errors of judgment or interpretation simply because of the sheer volume of rules and regulations. With the increasing movement, desirable perhaps in itself, towards self-assessment, the penalties for getting one's self-assessment wrong, even for the most innocuous of reasons, are increasingly steep and are making life increasingly difficult for ordinary taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) does nothing at all to simplify taxation laws. Instead, it makes them more complicated. It tries to patch up a manifestly crumbling system of law. It tries to paper over the cracks. As I have said, it will put another 86 pages into the legislative framework. As I also said, as if to draw attention to the confusion and complexity of the law, the explanatory memorandum to this Bill runs to 193 pages. Any average businessman would find the legislation very difficult to follow; so would, indeed, most accountants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislators have a basic responsibility in this area. That is why Bills such as this worry me greatly. The law should be simple, it should be straightforward and it should be easy to follow. It should not be so complex that it ties up valuable resources in trying to understand and comply with it. Indeed, more often than not it is incomprehensible even when taxpayers concentrate hard and try to find out what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country needs people to concentrate their efforts on creating tradeable goods and services and improving living standards. We do not need to have those resources enmeshed in red tape. To that extent, this Bill is obviously going the wrong way. It does nothing to make the taxation system simpler, fairer or more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The depreciation arrangements flow from the industry statement announcement of 12 March 1991. As I said earlier, these are very important arrangements. The amendments to the law that we are debating were first announced on 12 March 1991. They were supposed to contain measures to kick-start the economy. At that stage the economy was in the depths of recession. It was hoped that introducing some increased and improved depreciation arrangements, particularly those relating to the definition of `effective life', would somehow or other stimulate confidence and therefore increase investment in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have found, firstly, that as a result of fiddling with the rules and regulations, this has not worked. There has not been increased investment. This is because of the continuing uncertainty as to just what the definition of `effective life', which is the essence of this Bill, actually means in practice. Secondly, of course, if one is going to take so long to get things right in terms of definitions for taxation purposes, one automatically stalls any potential investment growth that might otherwise occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that the Government did not realise, and still does not realise, that business investment is largely a function of confidence. No-one can have confidence in a government that operates administratively the way that this Government does. The administrative incompetence of this Government exceeds that of any government&mdash;certainly any government in living memory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government seems to find it so difficult, if not impossible, particularly in the areas of economics and taxation, to provide through the Parliament to the nation as a whole certainty as to what it is doing and how it is going to implement its policies. This major factor is stalling any prospect of recovery in this economy. This is on top of or additional to the fact that the Government cannot control its own spending. It says that it is going to accumulate $20 billion of additional Budget deficits over the next three or four years. As we found from Senate Estimates hearings last week, already the figures for 1991-92 are going to be much worse than those that have been forecast either in the Budget or in the Government's economic statement as recently as 25 February. Last week during the Senate Estimates hearings we found that revenue collections to the end of February this year are at least $600m&mdash;and probably more than that&mdash;down compared with what it had been estimated they would be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is still unable to tell us what the expected revenue shortfall for the year as a whole will be. The larger the shortfall, the larger the Budget deficit will be and, therefore, the greater pressure the public sector and the Commonwealth part of the public sector will be putting on capital markets and therefore on interest rates over the months and the year or more ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one considers the impact that that will have on the private sector which will be competing with the public sector for funds in the marketplace, one starts to realise the enormity of the imposition the Government's incompetence, both in administration and in the carrying out of its policy, has on the state of the economy and what would otherwise be the possible resurgence of the private sector. No-one can have confidence when there is a government acting as incompetently and inefficiently as this Government is. This situation is exemplified in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The March 1991 industry statement included a revised depreciation regime based on self-assessment that allowed businesses to write off assets over their effective life. After widespread confusion over the operation of the regime and the definition of effective life, the Treasury put in place strict definitions which met the objective of conserving revenue but at the same time failed utterly to meet the objective of a more internationally competitive depreciation regime. The result of all of this has been, as I have said, that many corporations have actually delayed rather than brought forward their investment programs. The Government's contribution to an already weak investment climate has been to add to the uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We found that, having made its industry statement last March, the Government in its economic statement of 26 February this year made yet further changes in the area of depreciation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>That, of course, has just compounded the confusion. As a result, the Government is now seeking very significant amendments to the Bill before us. We on this side of the House and of the Parliament agree with many of these amendments but it is significant and must not be overlooked that the effect of this is to add to confusion and uncertainty in the private sector and to set back further the potential for economic recovery that might otherwise exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as being an administrative nightmare, the current tax system is a disincentive to investment and it damages the competitiveness of our exports. Those disincentives have been highlighted recently in a number of reviews of business taxation. For example, in November 1990, EPAC, the Economic Planning Advisory Council, said that Australia's `mongrel' tax system was so disjointed that investment in productive activities was most heavily taxed whilst speculative property investment was taxed the least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Government and other critics go around hammering the property speculators of the 1980s&mdash;and I guess we all do that&mdash;they ought nevertheless to bear in mind that it could well have been that many of those people were simply responding rationally in terms of economics to the incentives which this Government had created through a very distorted and biased tax system. That is something the Government has a great deal to answer for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That same EPAC study found that investment by a corporation in plant and equipment faced an effective tax rate of about 60 per cent for five to 25 years whilst investment in running costs such as maintenance faced a tax rate of just 31 per cent if the returns were spread over five years. That report also showed that, in terms of the overall tax impost, the Australian system imposed a higher effective rate of tax on those parts of the economy the Government was supposedly trying to expand. It showed that the depreciation system contained a large distortion in that it undercompensated for long-lived assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1991, the Industry Commission recommended that the tax burden on industry be lowered and that tax depreciation measures be reviewed. A report by Senator Button's department, DITAC, prepared at the request of Cabinet and reported in the press in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> amongst others on 18 February of this year, showed unequivocally that Australia's depreciation regime was less generous than those of our major competitors, particularly for long-lived assets. Some of the provisions we are now looking at in form of the amendments to this amending Bill have been brought in presumably as a result of that and because they were included in the Government's economic statement of 26 February. Yet, again, it is another apparent classic example of a government going about its activities without properly having done its homework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A report of the Business Council of Australia found that the tax system was a major factor in the decline of Australia's competitiveness. The main problems were found to be in the depreciation provisions and in the wholesale sales tax. Wholesale sales tax, of course, is a tax which compounds right through the whole cost structure of industry in this country, be it service industry, manufacturing, mining or what have you. It is built into the cost structure. That is one of the fundamental reasons why the coalition in its Fightback package is proposing the total abolition of the wholesale sales tax and its replacement by a goods and services tax because a goods and services tax does not get built into the cost structure at all whereas a wholesale sales tax automatically does. The Business Council found that that was an important factor in relation to Australia's lack of competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Business Council of Australia says that, coupled with the tendency of State governments to increase taxes on business inputs, the taxation system increases the cost burden on Australian activity at a time when world competitive pressures have been at their greatest. I agree totally with the Business Council of Australia. That is why, as I say again, we are abolishing the wholesale sales tax. That is why the coalition in government will also abolish the payroll tax which is a major cost impediment on business. It is a tax on jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when we have a situation in Australia of two million Australians either being unemployed or underemployed, it is absolute idiocy for this country to have a payroll tax. We will abolish that payroll tax and we will compensate the States out of the revenue from the goods and services tax and link further growth in the receipts of the States, so far as that aspect is concerned, to growth which will occur in the goods and services tax despite the fact that it will be a fixed rate as the economy grows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are some of the factors that fundamentally differentiate the coalition and the Government's approaches to industry policy and industry development and the growth of jobs in this country. We are prepared to take the measures which everyone knows need to be taken to abolish and reduce wherever possible the costs on doing business in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's so-called One Nation statement is a one job statement and a divided nation statement, given the way this Prime Minister has been carrying on both in his economic policies and in his attempt to continually divide the nation on such issues as the republican issue, the Australian flag issue and in a variety of other ways. What is most despicable of all is that he carried out those divisive actions and statements in foreign countries. He did not do it in his home country but abroad during overseas trips. What must the rest of the world think of us as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all part of the division and uncertainty that this Government is creating within the Australian community and economy. It is hardly surprising that more and more Australian companies are investing offshore when one looks at the taxation regime in this country compared with many of our potential competitors. An OECD study released just a couple of months ago showed that an Australian investment has to be 20 per cent more profitable than the OECD average simply to earn the same real rate of return. The reason for that is the punitive tax regime on business that exists in Australia. Also, the anti-corporate bias in our tax structure explains why domestic investment remained so sluggish during the 1980s. It has certainly continued into the early part of the 1990s, despite the recent increase in the share of national income going to profits, although if we look at profits after taking tax and interest charges out we find that at the moment corporate profits are at their lowest since records began 30 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are some of the problems that the coalition has seen in the existing tax regime of this Government. We welcome some of the changes that are contained in this Bill. As I mentioned earlier, there are 16 or 18 amendments which have now been circulated, covering something like a dozen pages. Indeed, several of those amendments have resulted from the Government's response to criticisms levelled by the coalition. I welcome that and also take this opportunity to put on the public record my appreciation and the coalition's appreciation for the work done by my friend and colleague Senator Watson in regard to taxation. He is an absolute bulldog both with us and the Government and, as a result of Senator Watson's very hard and competent endeavours, the Government to its credit has been prepared to make some changes in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day the future of this country and our ability to be competitive in the world and to be able to create the jobs that have to be created if we are to diminish and attempt to seriously tackle on a long term basis the almost criminal level of unemployment that we have in this country will depend on a much wider variety of policy decisions to be taken than in the area of taxation alone. That is why tonight, in the remaining minutes left to me, I challenge the Government&mdash;we all challenge the Government and have done so day in and day out with no response&mdash;to say why it will not adopt the taxation proposals envisaged and encompassed in the coalition's Fightback proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, those proposals involve a $13 billion reduction in personal income tax; a reduction of between 25 and 30 per cent of the total level of income tax that is paid in this country, particularly by lower and middle income earners. It includes a $20 billion reduction in the taxes on the cost of doing business, that is, producing goods and services in this country. One of the main taxes on business is the wholesales sales tax, which costs business something like $7 billion a year. This is written right into the cost structure of businesses and increases the cost of every activity in which we engage in Australia. Payroll tax costs almost $6 billion a year and is a $6 billion a year tax on jobs in this country, because it is an increase in the cost of doing business. Fuel excise brings in a total of $6.6 billion into the Government's coffers each year, of which almost $4 billion is a direct cost on business. If the fuel excise is abolished the cost of business will be cut by 25c a litre. It is those and other tax measures that are necessary if we are really going to be serious about creating jobs, restoring dynamism and growth to the Australian community and producing the prospect for future living standards for not only this generation but more particularly for our children and grandchildren. It is an indictment on the Government that it is unprepared to pursue that line. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Those provisions are repealed by clauses 4 and 5 of this Bill. Clause 6 of this Bill inserts a new section 8A, pursuant to which a surviving spouse whose pension entitlement is lost&mdash;and it might be perhaps clearer there to say `has been lost'&mdash;due to remarriage may apply to the Attorney-General for restoration of the pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General may direct that a pension be restored if he or she is satisfied that the applicant is in need or that the restoration of the pension is otherwise justified. In special circumstances restoration may be from a date earlier than the date of application, although that date must not be earlier than the commencement date of this Act. Under proposed section 8B, if the Attorney-General decides not to restore the pension, he or she must give notice in writing of the reasons for the decision and must advise of the applicant's right to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments bring judges' surviving spouses' pension entitlements into line with those of surviving spouses of public servants and politicians. The coalition notes that the number of additional pensions that will be paid as a result of these amendments is expected to be small. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might ask why, if subsections 7(2) and 8(2) are to be repealed, the new section 8A will say that a surviving spouse whose pension entitlement has been lost due to remarriage, may apply. As I understand it, that refers to persons who have already lost the pension under the existing Act and, under these amendments, they will then be able to apply to get that pension back. It is expected that people who become widows or widowers of judges or retired judges will probably have their pension entitlement continue almost, if not completely, uninterrupted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment to the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Act is a very minor one.

Firstly, the definition of `order under this Act' in section 112AA is amended so that a subpoena issued under the rules of court is an order under the Family Law Act, and the sanctions available to the Family Court for dealing with breaches of its orders will also pertain in dealing with failure to comply with a subpoena. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate today is discussing the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992. The Bill makes a number of largely non-contentious amendments. The main amendments relate to the pension entitlement of a surviving spouse of a judge or retired judge upon remarriage. It is only these amendments which have any financial impact, albeit of a very minor nature. The provision for a pension to continue upon remarriage already exists for politicians and senior bureaucrats. Therefore, this piece of legislation is only correcting an anomaly in the legislation dealing with judges' pensions and is eminently equitable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that judges do not contribute directly to a superannuation scheme, whereas politicians and senior bureaucrats certainly do. However, this is explained obviously by the fact that judges are totally restricted in their capacity to earn other income and, therefore, deserve special consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the first amendment which I have described, the amendments to be made by this Bill are as follows: the second amendment is to amend section 12 of the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Act 1955 to provide that the Minister rather than the Governor-General may approve leave of absence for members of the Defence Force Discipline Appeal Tribunal. This also is one that the Democrats will support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, a number of minor amendments are made to the Family Law Act 1975. The first one will make it clear that the sanctions available to the Family Court for dealing with breaches of its orders will be available when a person fails to comply with a subpoena. The second amendment repeals sections 116A and 116B which provide for payments to States and Territories for financial assistance in family law matters. These sections have now been made redundant as legal aid bodies are funded by grants under section 96 of the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the third amendment amends subsection 123(1)(u) to increase the maximum penalty which can be imposed for a breach of the Family Court rules from $500 to $5,000 so as to deter breaches under these rules. The rules impose penalties for failure to comply with a summons or garnishee order and for making false or misleading statements to the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments to the Family Law Act do not deal with the enforcement procedures and/or other penalties for breaches of orders of the court with respect to custody and access.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill is interesting and important legislation. The Bill deals with a very important subject; namely, that of conscription by Australians for the defence of our country. The legislation has a somewhat long background, going back to the Defence Act 1903. Modern events, which are the background to the amendments to the Act, in relation to conscription are very much influenced by the national service for the Vietnam war, the conscription which took place at that time and the after-effects of that experience, which resulted in a Senate committee inquiry and report. Indeed, there was a private member's Bill on one aspect of the subject by the Minister at the table, the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, there is quite a long history behind this piece of legislation. The Bill deals with a very controversial subject, one which has been particularly controversial at times in our history&mdash;the period of the Vietnam war was clearly one such period. Of course, it goes back much earlier than that to the conscription debates of the First World War. Despite the very controversial nature of the subject, as well as its importance, I am pleased to say that the Opposition is supporting most of the provisions of this Bill. There is one important exception to that, but we will be supporting the second reading of the Bill. We have an amendment with respect to conscientious objection. Apart from that and one other relatively minor matter, the Opposition will be supporting the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the Bill is an amendment to the Defence Act. The Defence Act tackled up-front the question of conscription. Section 60 of the Defence Act provides that the Government may introduce conscription for service in the defence forces in time of war by means of a proclamation by the Governor-General. In its historical context, that was quite normal. The decision to go to war is a major Executive act. The question of conscripting forces for defence or war of any kind was clearly seen at that time, and since, as an Executive act. However, the Defence Act limited the power of the Governor-General by the issue of proclamation to time of war. War is defined in the Defence Act as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . any invasion or apprehended invasion of, or attack or apprehended attack on, Australia by an enemy or armed force.</PARA>
<PARA>The power of conscripting Australians for national service is as it has been since the amendments in 1973. That legislation was post-Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That ability to conscript people for service is very limited. It applies only in the case of an attack or the threat of an attack on Australia by an enemy or armed force. I stress that at the forefront of my remarks on this Bill because it is vital to the Opposition's conclusions on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government proposes to make a number of amendments to bring that basic provision of the Defence Act up to date and to modernise it. Before I deal with that, I refer to the recent history of conscription. In 1951, the National Service Act was passed to introduce national service and to require Australians specified in that Act to be available to perform national service for a time. National service is a subject which crops up a great deal in discussion on defence matters. A view that still commands quite a deal of support in Australia is that all young Australians should perform some form of national service for a period of their early lives. However, I do not propose to go into the position in the Vietnam war period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Whitlam Government when first elected substantially repealed that National Service Act. However, it did not do so entirely, because there were people who had certain rights largely as a result of having been called up for national service. Therefore, the National Service Act was not entirely repealed. As a tidying up and modernisation operation, the first thing we should note about this legislation is that it now entirely repeals the National Service Act 1951. That clears the decks so that the piece of legislation which covers the question of conscription, and which should continue to cover it, is the Defence Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Defence Act was passed a long time ago. It set out in some detail who and what classes of citizens of Australia should be liable to be conscripted. As one might expect, at that time the Government was very much thinking of a large army. The view was that it should be a staged process, depending upon the exigencies of the requirement to defend Australia. For instance, it started off by saying that the first people to be called up would be unmarried males between 18 and 35. It then went down various classes to those who were married, those who were married without children and so forth, until finally the last order of people to be conscripted would be males between 45 and 60. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's view, and the Opposition agrees with this, is that this is an outmoded approach. In modern war, with the high concentration on technology and sophisticated equipment, it may not be so necessary to have large numbers of people. Although if Australia were attacked by a determined and powerful enemy, we would certainly need a great conscription of manpower. But with regard to the nature of the threat or the invasion of Australia, it may not be necessary to go that far. It may be more important to be able to conscript in the first place certain people with technical qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is proposing to scrap those provisions in the Defence Act and replace them with a power to make regulations. In other words, the Government would make regulations which would be more akin to the actual requirements of the day and the circumstances. That clearly is the way to go. No doubt it would be preferable for that to be included in the Act, but the very nature of flexibility that is required precludes these provisions now remaining in the Act. Instead, it is proposed that they should be in regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other outstanding feature of the existing provisions of the Act is that conscription is limited to males who are British citizens, excluding Aboriginal Australians. These are referred to as the discriminatory elements of the Defence Act. It is proposed that they be removed and replaced by a general requirement that anyone who is a resident in Australia for at least six months and is between the ages of 18 and 60 could be conscripted in accordance with the regulations that we are enabling the Government to make. Again, that is a provision with which we agree. Clearly, the obligation should not be confined simply to males. Certainly anyone who has lived in Australia for at least six months should not be excluded. If such people have made a commitment to Australia and if Australia found itself in dire need of defence, people of all kinds should be available, provided they are within the ages of 18 to 60. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now come to one of the more controversial aspects of this legislation. Traditionally, imperial powers have felt they needed to conscript people for wider purposes than simply the defence of the mother country. Indeed, that view has been adopted to some extent in Australia from time to time. It has been a feature of laws relating to conscription that people with a genuine conscientious objection to war should be relieved of the obligation at least to serve as combatants. This legislation tightens up and clarifies&mdash;in a much better way than did the old Defence Act&mdash;the availability of claiming a conscientious objection to military service. Again, as with a lot of the proposals made here, the Opposition has no objection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, there is a much tighter definition of what is a conscientious belief. The Bill provides that there must be a fundamental conviction of what is morally wrong, not necessarily based on religious considerations. It must be of so compelling a character that a person feels that he or she has a duty to abide by it. It also has to be of a longstanding nature. That latter provision is one of great importance from a practical point of view in how far people would be able to succeed in claiming conscientious objection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support what I see as a tightening up of the existing provisions. However, the Bill goes on to provide a new ground for exemption from compulsory service, and that is that the person claiming it may claim conscientious objection to the service in relation to a particular war or warlike situation. The Opposition does not believe that that is an appropriate provision to make in the Bill and we will be moving to delete it in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see this particular provision extending this area of conscientious objection as arising very much out of the circumstances of the Vietnam war. It was certainly very much to the forefront of the Senate committee which investigated this question and which, in fact, recommended that there should be available a conscience belief in these cases. But I come back to my original point. It has been overlooked that under the Defence Act we are now dealing with, the only power for conscription which a government will have&mdash;and has had for some time now&mdash;will arise in the very limited circumstances that Australia is invaded or is under the threat of invasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are talking here about circumstances in which Australians are being asked to defend Australia itself&mdash;maybe our territories which are near the Australian mainland. So we will, if necessary, have to conscript people to defend their own country. In these circumstances we think it is unbelievable that people should be acknowledged to have the right of conscientious objection to actually defend their own country. It was much more a problem and much more relevant when Australians were being conscripted to serve way beyond Australia's shores or areas of direct military interest, as they were in the case of Vietnam, although there were many good arguments that they were performing a very important role for the ultimate defence of Australia. But the fact is that we have quite a different situation here. Quite clearly, under the Defence Act we would be conscripting people simply to defend Australia itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be some debate on whether or not the circumstances of a threat to Australia are justified, but that matter is dealt with by the Government&mdash;and it is something that perhaps I should have mentioned earlier&mdash;providing in this legislation that Parliament itself should have to agree to a proclamation for conscription. That is certainly an important addition to the existing Act, which leaves that for an executive decision. This Act now will tidy that up and strengthen it, and say that there must be parliamentary approval for any such proclamation. That is important in relation to a government that comes along and says, `We want to conscript. Nobody is about to invade Australia but there is a real threat that there could be an invasion of Australia'. So that will not be left to the Executive but will be a decision for the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That having been decided by the Parliament, we believe that a person who wants to claim a conscientious objection would have to be able to establish a conscientious objection to participate in war itself or warlike operations. If the Government's proposal were accepted now to expand conscientious belief in the way this Bill does, we believe that it would be very difficult indeed to sort out whether people had political objections only, as against genuine objections. That would be a practical difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would also be very divisive for the community that people could, in fact, claim a conscientious objection when Australia was about to be invaded or, indeed, was invaded. If people were able to say, `No, I object to being invaded by this particular country but not another', that would be an impossible position to maintain as far as the morale of the whole community was concerned in the defence of Australia. To believe that people can pick and choose who would be a desirable or an undesirable invader, where one could have a conscientious objection to one country but not another, would be impossible to sell. Circumstances of that kind would create a tremendous division and affect morale in Australia, which would be very serious as far as the defence of the nation is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons we see this situation now as quite different from the Vietnam situation or a similar type of situation. In these circumstances, all these factors which are great improvements and which we support&mdash;the modernisation of this legislation, its adequate definitions now of conscientious objection, and the need for parliamentary approval for conscription&mdash;are spoilt by this innovation which we will oppose. </PARA>

Before I do, I would like to add to what Senator Durack said about the important removal of the antiquated legislation which only allowed certain classes of people to be conscripted to defend Australia. It is both right and proper that the legislation be amended to include all able-bodied men and women to come to the defence of this country if it is under threat.

The DFRDB remains a good scheme only for those who served 20 years or more with the forces. It offers nothing to those who serve for less than 20 years. In fact, it is not even really a superannuation scheme. In recent years only approximately 27 per cent of DFRDB members have received any benefit at all and of those that do, only a small proportion&mdash;one in 194&mdash;receives full retirement benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DFRDB does not meet the occupational superannuation standards. It is a compulsory 5.5 per cent of salary for all Defence Force members, paid directly into Consolidated Revenue rather than into an earning fund. Effectively, therefore, it is a $100m a year interest-free loan from defence personnel to the Government. It refunds members only their own contributions without earnings if they leave before 20 years. It includes a 3 per cent penalty for every year an officer leaves before the statutory retiring age, which means that they receive back less than their own contributions. Members of the Defence Force, by nature of their employment, have not been able to take a stand against such inequities. While the Government is coercing the private sector superannuation schemes into improving arrangements for the granting of employer contributions for those who resign early, the scheme which covers the nation's defence forces is being ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989 the Opposition, in its defence science and personnel policy, announced that it would ensure that defence personnel were not disadvantaged compared to the civilian community in relation to superannuation. In developing our policy, we recognised that Defence Force members were not paid interest on their contributions and that for those leaving before the 20-year mark this was a gross injustice. Fortunately, the Government eventually recognised this too. The Opposition's persistence had been effective, and the Government being in a position to take action did so with the implementation of the MSBS&mdash;a considerably better superannuation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new scheme is something which I think deserves credit. The MSBS meets all the occupational superannuation standards. It pays interest on contributions&mdash;contributions which can be raised from 5 per cent up to 10 per cent as the member requires to suit his or her retirement needs. It has a very handsome government component which rises from 18 per cent to 28 per cent of salary and is fully government-vested after seven years. It includes a retention benefit of one year's salary taxed at the 15-year mark to encourage experienced service men and women to remain in service for another five years. There are many benefits under MSBS and Defence Force members should take the time to acquaint themselves with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It surprises me to learn, as I did during the additional Defence appropriations at the Estimates Committee, that there was a lower than expected take-up rate for MSBS. Perhaps they were all waiting until the last minute, until September of this year when they must make a decision on whether to take it up or to stay with the DFRDB scheme. I am sure that an element of the problem is that for years the defence forces have learnt to distrust the Government and to be suspicious of decisions it makes. It has a bad track record and defence personnel are reluctant to believe it this time around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They only have to look back to 1986 when the Government legislated for a 2 per cent discount to be applied to the 1986 superannuation pension increase applied to government superannuation benefits payable to or in respect of former Commonwealth employees and Defence Force personnel. It effectively reduced the base on which superannuation pensions were to be calculated. Defence personnel were told that the 2 per cent discount of their superannuation pension would be restored once Australia's foreign debt, expressed as a proportion of GDP, was on a falling trend. I cannot imagine the Government trying to get away with doing this to one of the industry groups with union support. In 1989, after much pressure from the Opposition, the 2 per cent discount was restored. Inevitably, however, it leaves Defence Force personnel sceptical. Superannuation is their future and the Government has tampered with it before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some who may want to stay in DFRDB because they are nearing the 20-year mark are worried in case they are made redundant before 20 years, at the 19-year mark. They will only get a refund of their contributions rather than a meaningful retirement income. During the Estimates hearing it was highlighted that this could lead to redundancies based on the type of retirement plan a member had rather than on the needs of the Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is whether defence personnel are receiving adequate advice. An amount of $2.7m has been budgeted over two years to assist defence personnel in making their decision. This money is primarily being used to fund a superannuation information group to provide counselling to defence personnel, but many do not seem to be aware of it. I am also concerned that some defence personnel are not taking the time to find out what best suits them&mdash;and each case is different. It infuriates me that some people misinterpret aspects of MSBS and then circulate the misinformation. What is worse is that people then take the misinformation as gospel rather than checking it out for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation is a complex area. People should not listen to rumours, even those that sound convincing and come from senior levels. People should be responsible for their own futures and take the time to find out for themselves, even if it means seeking independent professional advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the specific amendments that this Bill makes to superannuation. They are basically housekeeping amendments. The first is an amendment to the Military Superannuation Benefits Scheme Act of 1991. Section 47 of the MSBS Act personally indemnifies the trustees of the MSBS Board of Trustees, the Commissioner of Superannuation and the staff assisting the Commissioner from any action, liability, claim or demand arising from the bona fide performance of their duties or functions. These amendments extend the indemnity provisions to cover an acting trustee, a member of an incapacity classification committee, and a member of a reconsideration advisory committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition was initially concerned about this amendment; indemnification from professional responsibility should not be allowed. However, we have since been advised that the amendments relate to personal indemnification only. The amendment does not affect the corporate liability of the Board as a whole, which liability is retained by section 47(2) of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment in this Bill is to the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973. It amends subsection 14(3) of the DFRDB Act, enabling the deputy of the chairman of the DFRDB Authority to preside at meetings in the absence of the chairman, taking precedence over the deputy chairman. If that sounds like Alice in Wonderland stuff, I believe that it is. But the Bill also ensures that a quorum is maintained&mdash;obviously an important matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the Bill amends the Defence Forces Retirements Act 1948. Honourable senators will recall that DFRB was the scheme that existed before DFRDB and that it closed to new entrants when DFRDB began in 1973. Given that it did close in 1973, a number of provisions in the DFRB Act are now obsolete. These amendments repeal the obsolete provisions which deal predominantly with fund contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before turning to the home loan amendments of this Bill, and before I leave the subject of superannuation, I think I should highlight a few of the Fightback initiatives which the Opposition proposes for the superannuation area and which will be of benefit to defence personnel. We will abolish all lump sum tax on superannuation pay-outs, abolish the absurd reasonable benefits limit, provide a 25 per cent tax rebate to all individuals who contribute or have contributions made on their behalf to superannuation funds up to $6,000 per year, and reduce the tax on employer contributions from 15 per cent to 5 per cent for those on incomes up to $55,000 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendments in this Bill relate to defence home loans. Firstly, the Bill makes amendments to the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990. The Defence Housing Authority Act, which establishes a home loans assistance scheme for members of the Defence Force, makes special provisions for incapacitated persons. The current definition in section 3 covers incapacitated persons who are discharged because of a compensable disability on or after the commencing day, which is 21 January 1991. An unintended consequence of this is that some incapacitated persons who joined the Defence Force after 14 May 1985&mdash;the cut-off point for eligibility under the old defence services homes scheme&mdash;and were discharged before 21 January 1991 are not covered by either the old or the new scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill amends section 3 to ensure that the definition of `incapacitated person' includes persons who are not currently covered by either scheme. The Bill also amends section 4 of the principal Act so that incapacitated persons who are affected by the amended definition have two years to exercise their entitlement. That is the same entitlement of all service personnel under this new Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, to have an entitlement to a home loan under the Act a member must be issued with an entitlement certificate. Section 13 enables certificates to be cancelled where they are found to be issued as a result of false or misleading statements or where entitlement did not exist. However, there is no provision to vary or reissue certificates in order to correct errors or omissions. The proposed amendment will enable the Secretary to the Department of Defence, who issues certificates, to vary or reissue them, effective from the time the original certificate was issued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Bill amends the Defence Housing Authority Act 1987 by amending the appointments by the Governor-General to the Authority to include the Assistant Chief of the Defence Force (Personnel) as the fourth member of the Defence Housing Authority. This move reflects a change in ADF higher structures. This, like all the previous amendments, will be supported by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I conclude, I must emphasise that I remain dissatisfied that in introducing the new defence home loans scheme the Government removed the entitlement to a home loan for war service. The fact that it did so at the same time the former Prime Minister was waving the troops off to the Gulf war adds insult to injury. As it remains, Australians who enlisted since May 1985 and on operational service are killed, or injured and invalided out of the Services no longer have an entitlement to a war service loan and nor does their surviving spouse. This is the first time since 1918 that Australians in war have not had such an entitlement, and the Government should be ashamed. This will now be the case for our personnel serving in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What of the personnel serving in Cambodia? In the litany of rough deals meted out by this Government to service men and women and ex-service men and women during its nine years in government, the treatment of the Cambodian peacekeepers takes the cake. If these people were unionists, peace would be on strike now in Cambodia. Our people went to Cambodia believing they would be dealt with in the same way as those who served in Namibia. Not so. Once the first two detachments had been deployed to Cambodia, the truth leaked out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The salaries of the Australian UNTAC peacekeepers in Cambodia and their $60 per day Cambodia allowance are to be taxed once the UN ceasefire has been called. Cambodia, like the Namibia peacekeeping involvement before it, will have our service men and women peacekeepers operating in dangerous, unmapped minefields, constantly subject to the threat of injury and disease, long after the ceasefire declaration. Yet the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, will not let them have the same tax-free status that was given to the Namibia peacekeepers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Determination No. 108 of 1991 made by the Department of Industrial Relations and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill soon to be introduced into the House of Representatives confirm what I say. This Government has long had a shabby record regarding the treatment of Australian servicemen, as I said before. Yet we heard the Government's hypocrisy in our Anzac Day speeches about remembering the bravery of Australian servicemen, their sacrifice and their willingness to lay down their lives for their country. I cannot believe that it is anything other than disgraceful that a Prime Minister can deliver words such as he did in Papua New Guinea when he is prepared to savage the compensation of those doing just that in the dangerous conditions of Cambodia&mdash;willing to lay down their lives for their country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister also said in his Anzac Day speech that the Australians who went to two world wars or to Korea, Malaya or Vietnam, went to secure a place in the world for their country and for its ideals. If we are not doing that with these service men and women who have gone to Cambodia, what are we doing? They are there to secure a place in the world for their country and its ideals, just as much as their fathers and grandfathers did before them. Yet this Government is prepared to make fine speeches a substitute for proper action for those who risk their lives in the service of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These personnel will lose the tax-free status of their pay after the ceasefire, which will be an artificial declaration if ever there was one, because the minefields will still be there; there will still be the gung-ho chappies with their rifles slung over their shoulders ready to run off a burst when they feel inclined. Also, these service men and women will be given a lesser degree of coverage under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Once they are no longer declared to be on operational service, the proof required will be more demanding under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The proof required is not just that they are serving in an operational area any more, but that their disease or injury was caused by that service. Sometimes, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would know from constituents who come to see you, years down the track when the effects of disease or injury incurred in war finally start to show their long term effects, it is often quite difficult to prove the connection with the war service, the operational service, which caused the problems the veteran is enduring. </PARA>

In general, this legislation makes amendments to the provisions concerning conscription and conscientious objection. It provides for the appointment of an assistant Chief of the Defence Force to the Defence Force Housing Authority and makes some changes to the provision of defence retirement benefits and the home loan assistance scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not propose to take the time of the Senate tonight to refer to the provisions of the Bill relating to the  Defence Housing Authority and the defence retirement scheme. I wish to confine my remarks briefly to what I find wrong with the Bill. What I find wrong with the Bill is, firstly, the 90-day requirement and the lack of flexibility that that confers on the Government of the day; and, secondly, the quite ludicrous proposition that, somehow or other, one can have the right to object to a particular war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will comment briefly on the history of conscription in Australia. It is not generally realised that conscription has been a factor in Australia since Federation for very many years. It existed before the First World War; it existed in the 1920s; it existed, I think, in the 1930s after the Labor Government was thrown out of office after having given us the first Great Depression that it has given us this century; and it existed on two occasions&mdash;in the 1950s and in the 1960s&mdash;with two separate schemes. I am one of the few people in this Senate who have discharged a national service obligation and I value the experience that was afforded me by the obligations that were placed on me by the Government of that day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite wrong to say that conscription was always a controversial issue in Australia. For example, the period of conscription from 1949 to 1959 was a period when there was no dissent about conscription of the Australian youth. There were no protests in the period before World War II, as I understand it. But the myth has been created by the Labor Party in light of the Vietnam experience that, somehow or other, conscription is always controversial and totally destructive of the good order of Australian society, so it cannot be entertained at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a place for conscription in the life of a nation when it looks to its own defence. I do not think it is a high priority today. I think we have higher priorities in providing a basic defence force than conscription today. But I place on record that the view that is sedulously cultivated by the Labor Party that conscription has been a very divisive issue and an issue which has divided the Australian community is a false one, like most of the Labor Party's views of Australia's military history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that in today's climate around the world, of high technology weapons systems, we do really need a high degree of professional ability in the defence forces. We need specialist training to operate those systems and the short term commitment that national service or a conscription program provides really does not suit itself to  the provision of highly professional, highly trained forces that the countries of the Western world have now adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the United States and the United Kingdom have moved away from conscription. Switzerland and Sweden are probably the only countries in the European theatre that exercise conscription. I would forecast that with the winding down of the Cold War, Swedish conscription will probably disappear in the foreseeable future. The Swiss will probably maintain it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What goes on in the Asian region, of which we are part, is another matter. Conscription is practised by Singapore and various other Asian nations will practise it from time to time. While I agree that there is no need for it for Australian defence requirements at present, I have enough knowledge of history to have a very strong desire for flexibility in our planning. I certainly would not exclude the fact that the need for it might arise in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, I have a marked concern about the 90-day requirement for notification to be given, which I think limits the flexibility of the Government. Part of that relates to the definition of `war' contained in the Act. It defines `war' in terms of threats to Australia and an imminent Australian invasion. There are a couple of problems with that. The first is that countries seldom declare war these days. The old convention of a declaration of war, followed by the outbreak of hostilities and a peace treaty after the surrender of one side&mdash;sometimes unconditional surrender&mdash;has all disappeared. That is not the way armed conflict between nations is now conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to recognise the fact that we live in a world where there will not be formal declarations of war and we should not be constrained legally to the fact that Australia is facing imminent invasion before acting. Clearly definable and demonstrable threats of that nature may well be impossible to demonstrate. It might well be an obligation on the Government to take prudent steps to reinforce Australia's defence capacity in the light of what are intangible threats. In certain circumstances some sort of conscription may be required to meet that threat adequately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with the point about the objection to a particular war. It has been a basic part of our cultural values that we have always accepted the right of a citizen not to serve in the armed forces on the basis of sincerely held religious and moral beliefs. The presumption is that they are long term. The introduction of this clause, which allows a person to have a particular objection to a particular war and therefore not serve, is absolutely impractical and wrong-headed in my judgment. It would expose Australia to the risk that we would be very much divided on religious grounds. If we were being attacked by a Muslim force, the Muslim community may decide, for example, that it was not going to enter into armed conflict with its Muslim brothers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That would be extremely divisive for Australia because we have certain cultural values which do not admit those distinctions. We admit that someone on a sincerely held conscientious belief against the violence of war has a right to claim exclusion from conscription. As part of our cultural values, we also hold the belief that it is the business of all to defend the country in times of great need. I would respectfully suggest that this is one of the further examples of what we are seeing from the Government as part of its long history of an inability to cope adequately with the needs of Australian defence. </PARA>

He made accusations against Mr Menzies, Mr Page and the other members of the United Australia Party and its predecessors in the early part of the Second World War, before Menzies was pulled down by the Country Party revolt and Artie Fadden was put in as Prime Minister in 1941. As part of the Anzac Day celebrations last week, we were celebrating the New Guinea campaign. The Prime Minister makes the claim that it was Curtin and the Australian Labor Party that saved Australia, and that the predecessors to that Government had done nothing to contribute to the defence of Australia. Nothing could be further from the truth. In the 1930s under the Lyons Government, the United Australia Party started the rearmament program&mdash;in the face of intense opposition from the Labor Party. Eddie Ward, who bore an uncanny resemblance to the present tendencies of the present Prime Minister, was always saying, `We want to take that money from defence and spend it on welfare; it is criminal to be spending money on defence'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Australia Party, the predecessor of the Liberal Party, started the industrial expansion of a country that could not even build cars beforehand. It gave us the ability to build our tanks, engines, aircraft engines, ships, armaments and munitions. That was all up and going in 1941 when the Japanese attacked. It raised something like 12 divisions; there were 10 divisions in Australia when Japan attacked and two overseas. It raised an air force, which ultimately was the fourth largest in the world, and a sizeable navy. All of those things were done. And not one of them would have been done by a Labor government if it had been in power in the 1930s. The proposition that is being run before the uninformed people of Australia that somehow or other the Curtin Government and the Labor Party were the great saviours of defence is a travesty of the truth.

It is very possible that some of those Australian troops, sadly, will be injured and some may be killed. I believe it is quite wrong for the Prime Minister to tell the Australian community that we are sending troops over there and that, if there is any sign of trouble, we will pull them out. That has two implications. It is misleading the Australian public to the extent that the Prime Minister is saying that those troops are safe and secure&mdash;as safe and secure as if they were in mainland Australia. Nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other side of the proposition is absolute nonsense. Our troops are integrated into a United Nations force. They provide a crucial function&mdash;communications. If things get difficult, if the Khmer Rouge, for example, play up, revolt and start the tricks that they have been at for the last 20 years in terms of armed warfare, does the Prime Minister really believe that the vital communications functions of the Australian Defence Force are going to be pulled out, that the Australians are going to cut and run and leave to their fate the Indonesians and all of the other members of the United Nations, who are probably in a combat role trying to quell what the Khmer Rouge are up to? That is a ludicrous proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister should be adult enough to say to the Australian people, `We believe that we have an obligation to the community of nations to support the United Nations in this effort. We will do all that we can to minimise the risk to the Australian contingent up there. But we must recognise that there is a risk and that they may pay with their lives on some occasions'. The Australian community is adult enough to accept that. Instead, we have all this dissembling from the Prime Minister that they will be pulled out if there is any trouble. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other misapprehension that the Prime Minister has created in the Australian community is that somehow or other Lieutenant-General Sanderson, an Australian general up there, will look after the Australian troops. Lieutenant-General Sanderson is the United Nations force commander. His obligations are to the United Nations; they are not to the Prime Minister of Australia. The commander of the Australian contingent up there is Colonel Stuart. He is the person who has the responsibility.

To a large degree this major piece of legislation happens to have the support of all senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Defence Act provided for conscription in terms of the immediate defence of Australia. It was conceived at a time nearly 90 years ago when attitudes and ways of doing things were quite different. In the 1950s the National Service Act supplemented the Defence Act and provided for the calling up of Australian men for compulsory service. In particular, during the Vietnam War national servicemen were conscripted to serve overseas. This led to a heightened and increased interest amongst many in Australia about the questions of conscription and conscientious objection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, in the 1980s a number of senators who were members of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs and who still had in mind the public debate that took place in the 1960s and the early 1970s helped produce a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Conscientious objection to conscripted military service.</EMPHASIS> This is in many way the point of departure.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has taken the opportunity to pick up many of the recommendations of the Senate committee inquiry and to completely repeal the National Service Act and the National Service Termination Act 1972. I should note that the latter Act effectively did make null the National Service Act of 20 years earlier. But because there were certain provisions in the National Service Act that gave a benefit to those who had served as national servicemen, the Act was not completely removed from the books. Only the operative ongoing parts of that legislation that actually affected national service and call-up were terminated by the National Service Termination Act. After 20 years, neither of these pieces of legislation are of any further relevance. The legislation now before the Senate completely repeals these two Acts. </PARA>

Clearly, Senator Newman has said, the Opposition believes and the Government proposes that all persons, both male and female, would serve this country in the Defence Force in time of war. In fact, persons liable to serve now include all persons aged between 18 and 60 who have resided in Australia for not less than six months. So it is not only citizens but also permanent residents of this country who are in this category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 60 of the Defence Act sets out the classes of persons who would be, subject to proclamation, called up. This would perhaps happen in order of priority. It would be based on whether someone is single, married, or a widower and also a person's age group. I believe that it is quite appropriate not only to amend section 59 in the ways that are proposed in this legislation but also to remove the rather Aristotelian classifications of section 60&mdash;to allow classification to be appropriate and defined appropriately to meet the particular needs of any proclamation that would be used to call up persons. So the categories of priority for call-up in any defence of Australia from immediate invasion in the future will now be subject to regulation and will no longer be defined as they are in section 60 of the present Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far so good. These changes are supported by the Opposition. The other broad area of this legislation relates to the defence force retirement and death benefits scheme, the Defence Housing Authority Act and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme Act. My colleague, Senator Newman, directly addressed these aspects of the legislation. My colleagues and I readily agree with what she has said about the Act and about the Government's inadequacies. However, the Opposition agrees with the Government with regard to the precise legislative initiatives that are now before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matters that remain and which are contentious flow on from the agreed definition for `conscientious objection', the setting up of tribunals and the need for parliamentary approval for conscription proclamation. There is contention about conscientious objection to a particular war and to the provision of a 90-day limit in terms of any parliamentary approval. I will need to speak to these matters when the Senate resumes debate on this legislation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday, 14 April, Irene Greenwood died after a long illness and after having been for four years in the Alfred Carson Nursing Home in Claremont in Western Australia. She was in her ninety-third year and had been dynamic, active and energetic, keenly interested in current affairs generally and the status of women in particular from very young womanhood until she suffered a stroke which severely disabled her and led to her death.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Irene Adelaide Driver was the daughter of a prominent member of the Womens Christian Temperance Union when that organisation was significant in persuading the Western Australian Parliament to extend the vote to women in 1878. Her mother, Adelaide Driver, was widely known as a prominent and effective woman of her time. Irene herself enthusiastically embraced her mother's feminism and activism. Her long life was dedicated particularly to the enhancement of the status of women, and no less passionately to the cause of world peace and disarmament long before it was fashionable or even acceptable to work as a peace activist. We sometimes forget that even the Womens International League for Peace and Freedom, of which Irene was a long time member, was considered seditious for many years. It took courage to be a member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a young woman, she spoke in the Domain in Sydney at a rally supporting Egon Kisch, the Austrian pacifist whom the Menzies Government sought to exclude from Australia but who literally jumped from a ship, broke his leg and was spirited away by the peace activists to avoid deportation. This occurred in the mid-1930s and Irene told me much later that the organising committee put her on the platform because it needed a woman and she was conspicuous because of her red hair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her ebullient nature, which she believed was inevitably associated with her red hair, kept her in the forefront of a wide range of activities especially associated with women and peace. She wrote for and edited <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dawn</EMPHASIS>, the official organ of the Western Australian Council for Equal Pay and Opportunity for many decades and collected feminist writings which, with her own voluminous records of her committee work, were acquired as the Irene Greenwood collection by the Murdoch University in the late 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Australians would recall the regular broadcasts that she made for years conducting a program embracing all aspects of cultural activities and local and international affairs, in a time slot intended for women at home. The session was sponsored by a Perth milliner. Irene's beautifully prepared scripts for radio, heard by large and loyal audiences, constituted the bulk of her own writings and their quality was recognised in 1975 when she was awarded a life membership of the Guild of Australian Writers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her red-gold hair had become nearly white before I got to know her well when she was in her 70s. She frequently expressed frustration that she had not written her own life story, simply because she had not had the time. There were endless demands upon her, even up to the time of her stroke. Fortunately, in her latter years she had been systematically interviewed for the Battye Library oral history collection. A previous set of recordings which she herself had painstakingly made had been stolen, probably by children looking for tapes to play with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A compulsive correspondent, her letters will probably one day be collected. She was corresponding with people like Manning Clark and the Whitlams until she became sick and disabled in 1988. An internationalist, she made friends and contacts in many countries during an era in which that took a lot more time, effort and resources than it does today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the Women's Service Guild of Western Australia, of which she was an honorary life vice-president, Irene contributed her energy and talents to the International Alliance of Women, a non-governmental organisation established 90 years ago when Vida Goldstein of Victoria attended its inaugural meeting in Washington. As a result, the Australian League of Voters became an early affiliate and later the Women's Service Guild. It was at Irene's insistence that the Women's Electoral Lobby affiliated with this prestigious NGO in 1982.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Irene was one of the first professional women to be employed by the Western Australian Government in 1919, and she maintained an intense interest in the International Labour Organisation for many decades. As in all her activities, she was unceasingly determined to disseminate her knowledge and experience and imbue other women with enthusiasm for the United Nations and such agencies as the International Labour Organisation. For many years she was the leading force behind the celebration of International Women's Day in Perth. She has shown me programs dating back at least 40 years. The United Nations' Declaration on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women, which used affectionately to be called DEDAW, was the focus of much of her formidable proselytising from the time of its genesis in 1948 until it became a convention in 1979. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the second wave of feminism reached the shores of Western Australia Irene, then in her early 70s, threw herself wholeheartedly into the organisation and education of those who came newly to active feminism through Women's Lib and the Women's Electoral Lobby. She instilled in us a sense of history. `Herstory' was the word which was coined to describe the knowledge of and respect for the work of our foremothers, hidden from history until the last decade or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can never adequately express my debt to Irene for many things: her support, her wise counsel, encouragement, affection and her pride in womanhood and sisterhood. I could go on. However, Irene's greatest gift to me has been that sense of what has gone before: the struggles of generations of dedicated feminists against the barriers of entrenched bias against women, and social attitudes which denied them economic and political equality with men. For example, it is less than 20 years since the typical response of the media to issues concerning women was to sensationalise, trivialise, and/or ridicule. How wonderful that Irene lived to see the journalistic and editorial transformation that now ensures that concerns and achievements of women are treated as a matter of course and usually with dignity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the United Nations Year of Women was announced, the Whitlam Government appointed an advisory council to guide the Australian Government's contribution to the celebration of that momentous occasion. Elizabeth Reid, adviser on women's affairs to the then Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, recognising the wisdom and energy of Irene, was instrumental in her inclusion on that committee. As ever, Irene's generosity with her time and expertise was completely at the disposal of the Government as she committed her heart and soul to the activities centred upon that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She was offered the opportunity of travelling to Mexico for the United Nations conference in 1975 but declined on the basis of her advanced years and her expressed wish that a younger woman should go instead. It was as a result of her insistence that I was invited to go on the delegation to the Tribune in Mexico in 1975&mdash;an experience which was described by all those who took part in it as quite extraordinary and unique. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Honours came to Irene late in her life. Between her seventy-fifth and eighty-fifth birthdays, she worked for a chair of peace studies at the Murdoch University and was awarded, amongst other things, an honorary life membership of the Guild of Writers, an Order of Australia, a doctorate honoris causa by the Murdoch University and a Silver Peace medal by the United Nations Association of Australia and, perhaps what pleased her most of all, a State ship was named after her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many women in Western Australia, in the rest of Australia and internationally will celebrate the life of Irene Greenwood with me and with my daughters. Her daughter and grandchildren were sources of great joy and pride to Irene. To them I extend loving sympathy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise to speak briefly about something that I think is a success story and the sort of story that unfortunately does not enjoy much publicity in our media. I am talking about the Australian best practice demonstration program and the satisfaction&mdash;if not pride&mdash;that I took from being asked to present the cheque for $200,000 as the first payment of a total of $420,000-plus grant to a firm called Hendersons Automotive in South Australia. I made that presentation in December last year and tonight I want to place on record one of the reasons why that firm was short listed for the prize under the best practice management program awards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is probably best summarised by giving a small history of the firm. In 1985 the parent company of Hendersons Automotive South Australia recommended closure. Hendersons was paying big workers compensation bills, losing an average of 300 hours a month to injuries, 32 per cent of the work force was injured annually, staff turnover hit 120 per cent a year, absenteeism stood at 8 per cent and the company was facing substantial loss by the end of June 1986. Despite strong growth in the industry, this firm was unable to improve sales or make a profit. Under threat of closure, the 200 people in the firm committed themselves to rapid change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The indicators which forecast doom in 1985, today point to success. The firm is profitable, only one worker has suffered injury in the past 27 months, and that was a broken finger, absenteeism is well below 2 per cent and staff turnover has been slashed to 9 per cent. Each year this firm is spending $500 per employee on training, which is well above the national average, and there has been a 25 per cent boost in skilled labour without an expansion in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work that has gone into restructuring, and moving from what was the story in 1985 to the extraordinarily good performance in 1991-92 at Hendersons Automotive, has seen it become one of the international suppliers of its principal product, that is, seats for cars. It actually achieved a quality rating that allows it to compete successfully in the American car market&mdash;a quite extraordinary achievement for a small firm in South Australia. In September the firm received confirmation of contracts to supply seating components to three US car makers, Chrysler, General Motors and Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac. These contracts are the result of that drive to quality, the introduction of better practice management, having the huge expenditure on occupational disease and injury reduced to almost nothing now, a complete change in heart on the part of employees there and an extraordinary turnaround in attitude, job satisfaction and, as a result of that, productivity and performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one of the many stories that can be told about the work force in Australia which is very rarely told. I am delighted to place it on record tonight. I wish to take this opportunity of congratulating all the workers involved in that plant and Mr Dedrick, the manager, who was in charge of the whole turnaround and certainly of overseeing it. He would say that it has been a combined effort and commitment of all the work force there and I have no dispute with that. I was very pleased to look briefly at the plant and meet with the workers when I was down there presenting the first part of their cheque. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the particular points of interest to me were the stories of two women, which were only two of the stories which could be told of the women who work there. Linda Saberton is now 43 and married with three children and one grandchild. She is a former bank clerk who was forced out of her job in the 1960s by bank employment policies which discriminated against married women. Mrs Saberton said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was bank policy that you had to resign when you got married. That was in 1967 and, after five years at home raising three children, I went out looking for a job and started at a car component maker on the production line as a process worker.</PARA>
<PARA>Three years ago she joined Hendersons Automotive as a senior production controller. It is her skill in her job and judgment which ensures that orders for car seat frames and slides are completed on time and on the day scheduled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The car industry operates under the `just in time' principle which means that the minimal amount of stock is stored and the maximum amount of stock is delivered as needed. That requires a very fine judgment of having all systems go and arriving at the right place at the right time to ensure that what is promised to be delivered is delivered. It requires a real commitment by all those involved in the work force to get their part of that production line in the right place at the right time. Mrs Saberton's job is to receive and check the orders, input all of that information into the computer, allocate componentry and labour hours to ensure that the company has the people and the parts in the right place at the time. She says it is very demanding because she has to be right. She cannot afford&mdash;and neither can the firm&mdash;to get that wrong. She said that as well as the satisfaction from doing that, doing it well and being satisfied and pleased with the success that she can contribute to, she was also delighted that she could share some of the stories of her employees with us. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We've got one guy who started here as a process worker and now, at the age of 29, works in the Production Control Department and has completed the second year of his science degree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also pleased to see the number of other staff who have actually had a change of heart and job satisfaction after going to work there. They found a work force that was concerned about other workers and each gained satisfaction from the job and knowing that the person beside them was also provided with job satisfaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other story of a woman that was particularly drawn to my attention&mdash;and I am pleased to pass these stories on&mdash;concerned Lynn McDonald who is 26 and a personnel officer at Hendersons Automotive. She joined Hendersons from the southern suburb of Christies Beach after high school in 1981 as a junior costing clerk and was working as a receptionist and payroll clerk when management asked her if she would like to study human resource management. In June 1990 she completed her advanced certificate in human resource management at the Adelaide College of TAFE after four years of part time study. She attended eight hours of lectures each week and the company contributed half as time off allowed during working hours. She said herself that she changed her view about what the prospects were for herself and, indeed, her own expectations for herself, as a result of being part of that work force which encouraged her to extend her capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both of these stories indicate and illustrate beautifully by means of case histories the real, everyday examples of how a change in attitude towards best practice management, in collaboration with the changes in the workers in that firm, has resulted in a huge turnaround. Because of my interest in occupational health and safety, I was particularly struck by the dramatic reduction in accident and injury that has happened in that company. It is important to note that the fall in the number of accidents and injuries is an indication of a work force that is satisfied with what it is doing and feels constructive and productive at work. The number of accidents in the work place can be a measurement of unsafe equipment, et cetera, but very often it is also a measurement of dissatisfaction, less than optimal working circumstances or working climate, or attitude towards workers and what workers are contributing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This story is particularly significant in terms of the turnaround of occupational health and safety. It is very important to see that as one measure of the effects of best practice management. The other great measure, of course, is the improved productivity and the maintenance in a time of recession of all the 204 employees in the work force&mdash;that is the same number that has been there over those six years. While we are hearing stories of gloom and doom, we sometimes fail to note the success stories of the very sort that this Government's policies have been aiming to see implemented. Here is a really stunning example of the sort of thing that can emerge from best practice management. I am pleased to put on record the story of what has happened at Hendersons Automotive and also my congratulations to all involved in that success. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before doing so, I will refer in this instance to an article that was published last week in the magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Idea</EMPHASIS> in its issue of 18 April. The story was entitled `In Search of Paradise'. This tells of the experience of Dianne Marshall, now of Queensland's Gold Coast but previously from Coffs Harbour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the interjection, I do not scan the pages of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Idea </EMPHASIS>very often for the subjects of my adjournment speeches, but this one in particular is worthy of being brought to the attention of the Senate. I do not deny it any credibility because I had to go to that source for it. This was brought to me through another forum as well, but it is well explained in that magazine and I will quote from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the backyard of her Coffs Harbour house, Dianne Marshall was sprayed with chemicals from a crop-dusting plane. She was pregnant; the baby died soon after birth. Last week I was given an outline of many instances of people, water supplies and rivers in and around Mungindi being sprayed. Mungindi is a cotton growing area in northern New South Wales near the border of Queensland. One sequence of events started in February 1985, and I have been told that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . at 5.30 a.m. a plane sprayed into a strong wind, blowing directly into our house. We could not get the windows closed in time and the inside of the house was like a fog and my face felt as if acid had been thrown on it and one of my children's lips and throat were burning. The spray was Parathion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the information of the Senate, I will describe what parathion is. It is a chemical which is used in fruit growing areas throughout Australia. It is also used on some citrus crops and in the growing of cotton. Ethyl parathion distributors have been advised to stop further sales pending the results of an investigation, and a code of practice will shortly be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Workers Union drew attention to two cases of poisoning last month in the Goulburn Valley where a grower and his wife were hospitalised. They had been using diluted parathion concentrate to spray fruit but they had not worn protective gloves. In the United States there have been 52 recorded deaths from parathion poisoning over 25 years. In Brisbane recently a handyman working at a nursery died after accidentally drinking a form of parathion from a Coca Cola bottle. An inquiry was announced earlier this year by the Victorian Minister for Food and Agriculture, Mr Baker, following complaints from the AWU that uncontrolled use of the chemical in Victoria's fruit growing areas was endangering the health of fruit pickers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer again to the story I was quoting from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Idea</EMPHASIS> about the children's lips and throats burning and that the spray being used was parathion. The story continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rang the cotton grower and asked if he would spray when the wind was blowing away from the house. His reply was that I was not dead yet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A month later at six in the morning we had chemical right through the house again. I tried to get the plane to stop spraying. They refused so I got the police to stop them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no authority that wanted to listen or do anything about our situation and the cotton grower threatened to sue if I stopped him spraying when he wanted to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an angora goat stud. The plane would fly over us so low, it sent the goats crazy, so they ran into fences and piled on top of each other. As time went by the does started to abort and have dead kids. Although we had blood tests taken nothing could be found to indicate the cause.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Spraying continued and an increasing number of people began complaining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In April 1989 24D and roundup mixture was sprayed with the wind blowing toward our property. The garden, and fruit trees were wiped out, as well as all the grasses and herbs on our 20 acres. The Department of Agriculture Inspector arrived two weeks later and said that the place had been badly contaminated but there was not enough evidence to do anything about it.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the tiniest tip of a very big iceberg which I intend to persist with until governments take this issue seriously. A list has been accumulating in my office. The only real option I have is to bring these case studies to the Senate to indicate how seriously people are being affected by the inaction with regard to this problem which persists throughout Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support a condolence motion moved in the other place earlier today by the honourable member for Herbert, Mr Lindsay, and supported by the honourable member for Fadden, Mr Jull, regarding the death last week of Robert Noel Bonnett. He was the Federal member for Herbert from 1966 to 1977.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Townsville will long remember Duke Bonnett, as he was known to all and sundry, for his distinguished war record and the great improvements he brought to the Townsville region during his term as the Federal member. Duke Bonnett enlisted in the Australian Military Forces in March 1941. He served in the south-west Pacific between 1941 and 1943 with the 2/3 Independent Company and 2/3 and 2/9 Cavalry of the Commando Squadrons. He had a distinguished service record and was promoted in the field to the rank of lieutenant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Duke Bonnett died last week and his funeral service was held last Friday at the cathedral in Townsville. After Duke Bonnett left the Army but prior to entering Parliament in 1966, he was a timber cutter, a cane cutter and worked on many cattle and sheep stations in north Queensland. Immediately prior to his election, he was the field officer for the Liberal Party in north Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He made a major contribution to the welfare of the Townsville region. Things like the Lavarack Army Barracks, the Australian Institute of Marine Science and a rehabilitation centre for the disabled all became a reality through Duke Bonnett's personal efforts during his 11 years as the Federal member. This period was a time of unprecedented expansion and progress in the Townsville region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the support of Duke Bonnett, the James Cook University of north Queensland and the Yabulu nickel refinery were also established during his term in Parliament. He was a tireless advocate for the Burdekin Dam, the construction of which the Fraser Government committed itself to in 1981. Duke Bonnett was the shadow Minister for pensions, repatriation and housing between 1972 and 1974 and the Opposition spokesman for national and northern development. He served on parliamentary committees for Aboriginal affairs, wildlife conservation, public works and Defence Force retirement benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He announced his retirement from Parliament in August 1977 due to ill-health. He lived in Canberra for a little while and then returned to Townsville where he again devoted himself to the City through his involvement with the Returned Services League and other local charities. Duke was always a father-figure at special Liberal Party gatherings. I speak specifically for a member of my staff and on behalf of all Liberals in the Townsville region in extending their condolences and sympathies to his family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Duke was a very kindly man and one who was loved by all of those who came in contact with him. He helped to put the Liberal Party on the map in north Queensland and will long be remembered by his Liberal colleagues for his work for the Party in north Queensland and in the Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My personal association with Duke Bonnett goes back to 1965-1966. He was probably my first mentor, one might say, in party politics when I joined the Burdekin branch of the Young Liberals at the time when he was moving in that area as the Liberal Party field officer. He was a very kindly and a very supportive man. I can still clearly remember our great excitement in the Burdekin branch in 1966&mdash;in those days Burdekin was part of the Federal seat of Herbert&mdash;when Duke Bonnett won the seat, taking it from the Labor Party for the first time in many years. I can still remember the great excitement and parties at the time not only for winning it but also because a person as good as Duke Bonnett had won the seat and would be there to represent us in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a very genuine bloke and a very sincere person. He was genuinely concerned for people. He worked behind the scenes to get things done to help the little people in his electorate. It was for that reason that he was re-elected time and time again&mdash;I think some five times in the 11 years that he was in Parliament. My sincere sympathies, and those of my wife and Liberal Party people in north Queensland, go out to the family of Duke Bonnett who have survived him. The people of the north have indeed lost a great man. We have all been enriched by his contribution to life in the north, by his advice and kindliness and by his selfless devotion to those things he believed in. Well done, Duke. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) All chemicals whether farm, industrial or household products have potential dangers if due care is not taken with their use. In particular, agricultural chemicals used in pest and disease control are biologically active and can pose a risk to users and the environment if not properly handled including safe application and disposal. Products containing 2,4-D may be safely used in agricultural, industrial and domestic situations provided the directions on the label are observed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Agricultural chemicals are strictly regulated and must undergo a rigorous assessment and approval process before they can be registered for sale and use in Australia. This assessment involves the review of extensive scientific information by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (NOHSC), Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) and other expert bodies. The review process is coordinated by the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council (AAVCC).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">NHMRC is responsible for the evaluation of the public health aspects of agricultural chemicals. NHMRC has extensively reviewed the toxicology of 2,4-D and various epidemiological studies that have been reported. As a result NHMRC has recommended appropriate label warning statements, first aid instructions, safety directions and permissible residue standards. NHMRC is satisfied that provided 2,4-D is applied according to the approved use-pattern there is little likelihood that there would be ill effects on public health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) There is potential for all agricultural chemical products to be misused. State legislation, however, makes it an offence to use an agricultural chemical product for a purpose or in a manner contrary to the approved label directions which have been determined following evaluation of the products safety and performance. Farmers are continually reminded of their obligation to use all pesticides in a safe and proper manner and routine monitoring of food commodities for pesticide residues by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and State agencies indicates that there is a high level of compliance with label recommendations. Should incidents occur which may indicate misuse or inappropriate use, eg chemical spray drift damage, then these are investigated by State authorities and corrective action initiated. Penalties for misuse can be severe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) 2,4-D has been in use in Australia for in excess of 30 years and products currently available for sale were registered by individual States prior to the commencement of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988 and establishment of AAVCC. More recent information on the safety of 2,4-D has been assessed by Council's advisory bodies which are satisfied that continued registration is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Companies seeking clearance of an agricultural or veterinary chemical product must provide to the AAVCC extensive technical data as outlined in the Requirements for Clearance of Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (1989) issued by AAVCC. In summary, this data package must include information on the chemical with regard to public and occupational health and safety risks, residues in food, environmental impact and effectiveness against the pest or disease. The information requirements of the AAVCC are consistent with those of other countries such as the USA, Canada and the United Kingdom. They are also consistent with international guidelines established by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations and the World Health Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Provided that AAVCC is satisfied that the product poses no undue hazard to the safety of persons, environment and non-target organisms, treated crops or livestock, international trade, and is effective for its stated uses, a certificate of clearance in respect of that chemical product will be granted allowing the product to be registered in the States for sale and use.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. Except for several agricultural products outlined below, Australia's tariff offer in the Uruguay Round, which is in accord with the agreed target for a one third reduction on a trade weighted basis, is based on the binding of tariffs at the end rates announced in the May 1988 Economic Statement.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concessions and commitments on both agriculture and non-agriculture items offered in the draft schedules tabled at the beginning of March in Geneva are conditional on comparable concessions and commitments being lodged and confirmed by our major trading partners in areas of export interest to us.</PARA>

The draft texts, which are part of the Draft Final Act of the Uruguay Round tabled by the Director-General of the GATT on 20 December 1991, are elaborations of the current GATT Codes.
