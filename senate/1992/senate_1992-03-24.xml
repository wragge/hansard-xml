<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Finance. I refer the Minister to yesterday's announcement by the Minister for Finance that funds for several of the Government's key programs are about to run out and that the Government intends to introduce a new Appropriation Bill today to correct this situation. Why is the Government considering this unprecedented action of introducing another Appropriation Bill and amending Appropriation Bills already in the Parliament at this time? Why did the Government not know about this funding crisis when it introduced the additional appropriations&mdash;Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4)&mdash;only four weeks ago? Is the proposed action necessary because the normal channel of funds for temporary funding purposes&mdash;the Advance to the Minister for Finance&mdash;has been used up for other purposes? How can the Government have been able to appropriate $317m for a Wills by-election one-off family allowance bribe but not be able to provide for necessary ongoing funds for child-care, the aged and the unemployed?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short can work that out now in retrospect&mdash;very smart. But he ought to have thought about it a few months ago when a decision was made by the Government to have that allowance payable on 2 April. No date had been fixed for any by-election at that time. So do not try to get any silly electoral comfort out of this. This is for the benefit of families across Australia and families across Australia will benefit from it and they will recognise it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is really descending to the bottom of the barrel to make that suggestion. I assure the honourable senator that nothing like that was even contemplated at the time the One Nation statement was prepared. Senator Short, who spent his weekend tramping around Wills&mdash;most of the people were sensibly out when he called, I gather&mdash;should have spent a bit more time on that than raising this sort of issue in the Parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry; that is quite wrong. In so far as the question had any substance at all to it, let me say that funding for the three items included in the urgent Bill, which was discussed with Senator Short yesterday, cannot wait for the passage of the normal Additional Estimates Bills in early June. The reason for that is that there has been a blow-out in funding and the Bill brings forward&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. The Bill brings forward expenditure originally included in the Additional Estimates Bills, with the exception of some additional funding for child-care. The need for this urgent Bill has arisen because the three programs involved are demand-driven personal benefit entitlements funded from annual appropriations. Hence, there is always a risk that actual demand may differ from the best estimates made at the time of the Budget. Failure to take action could deny eligible recipients of these programs their entitlements until after the passage of the Additional Estimates.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Faulkner is astute in these matters. He is already aware of the statement made yesterday by the Treasurer in relation to the improved depreciation schedule announced in the One Nation statement. This can be done on a straight line basis as well as on a declining balance basis, which was the decision announced in the statement. That change has been introduced to provide flexibility to firms in respect of their accounting. The straight line rates to apply will be two-thirds of the declining balance rate for each of the effective life classes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday there was a comment by Ross Gittins in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on the changes to the depreciation allowance announced in the One Nation statement. The first thing I want to say about the changed depreciation allowance and the improved investment climate is that the decision makers&mdash;from the Chief Executive of BHP, to the Chief Executive of the ANZ Bank, to Mr John Elliott, a former President of the Liberal Party&mdash;have all approved and applauded these changes. They are the people who have to write the cheques in respect of investment and they are on record as supporting the One Nation statement. As I said, yesterday Mr Gittins was on record as making some comments about these changes. The point he makes, I suppose, is the conflict in respect of the business decision makers, who suggest that the right balance was found but who are self-seeking in terms of changes to the tax system. Of course, in part, that is true because businesses have to be concerned about the taxation environment in which they operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the One Nation statement has the right balance between these two things. The depreciation rates and the development allowance in the One Nation statement are not a response to the business cycle; they are there to address structural issues. The point of the improved investment allowance is not so much to satisfy the peculiar requirements of Australian business. If the economy of Australia is to be internationally competitive, both in this country in terms of import replacement and attracting investment and overseas in terms of exports, then we have to have a competitive depreciation regime. Anybody who has done any work on this issue or made any study of it knows that we did not have a competitive depreciation regime.</PARA>

It is an issue which is not seriously addressed in the Fightback statement.

Is it a fact that a number of key labour market programs for the unemployed are seriously underspent to date and that the latest DEET projection to the end of the financial year shows that the Jobstart wage subsidy program will be underspent by $44m, the Jobtrain program for the long term unemployed will be underspent by $5m and the job skills wages program will be underspent by $20m? Given this forecast underexpenditure of $69m on labour market programs, why is it that this afternoon the Minister for Finance will be seeking a further $87m for such programs when, despite the fact that there are already one million Australians unemployed and expenditure on these programs is the lowest per unemployed person since 1982, the Government is unable to spend the amount already allocated?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the recent ICAO report, which indicated that, according to preliminary estimates, total aviation traffic in 1991 was down 4 per cent and international traffic was reduced last year by 5 per cent. The ICAO report went on to say that this was the first time since the 1940s that world schedule traffic had shown a decline. This is symptomatic of the current international problems of recessed economies, which have impacted in an international sense on this industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I am pleased to report that the picture in Australia is quite different, with 1991 proving to be a record year for total traffic in Australia, due mainly to the effects of domestic deregulation. Domestic passenger numbers for 1991 were up nearly 30 per cent on the previous year and even outstripped traffic growth in the previous record year, 1988, when high traffic was generated by Expo and bicentenary events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the year ended 31 December 1991, a record 16.7 million passengers were carried in Australia. I am also advised that domestic passenger numbers for January 1992 were up 20 per cent on the previous year, demonstrating that the benefits of deregulation are continuing to be taken up by the Australian travelling public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the international scene, Australian preliminary international passenger and freight figures for 1991 indicated a level of traffic almost equal to the record levels achieved in 1990. This was despite the substantial negative impact on traffic as a result of the Gulf war. With the changes to aviation policy outlined in the Government's economic statement, these levels of aviation activity and the commensurate benefits for Australian consumers, the tourist industry and the economy will be further enhanced.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that the electorate of Wills has a high level of unemployment; I do not believe it to be the highest. This morning I met with members of the Northern Region Commission, which is a group of shire councillors who represent many of the shires in the electorate of Wills. We had a long discussion about the reasons for this level of unemployment in the electorate. Certainly the recession is one of them.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second reason is the fact that there has been a reliance very much on firms in what I would describe as more traditional industries in that electorate compared with, for example, south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne where new industries are much more prevalent than in the region covered by the Northern Region Commission. There are other reasons, such as the inability of the region to attract new industries to date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the job losses in the textiles, clothing and footwear sector are concerned, I do not know the exact number. Senator Spindler referred to a figure of 600 in his question. A figure of 450 was presented to me this morning by the Region Commission. I do not know the exact number but I know that, as in other sectors, the recession has cost jobs in this sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point that while, at the end of last year, employment in the textiles, clothing and footwear industry had declined by 14 per cent, in the financial sector it had declined by 24 per cent, in the metal trades industries by 17 per cent and in some other sectors of the economy the figures were higher than that&mdash;but lower than the financial sector, which was the top figure. The figures were considerably higher than the TCF sector. I think that has to be borne in mind when looking at those figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the motivation for Senator Spindler's question. The chairman of the employer body in the textiles, clothing and footwear industry has been advocating support for the Australian Democrats in the Wills by-election. In that sense, I understand the motivation for the question. But knowing the traditional voting behaviour of the chairman of the textiles, clothing and footwear industry in Victoria, I doubt whether he would vote for the Democrats&mdash;I think he would be more inclined to vote for somebody else. He is prepared to advocate a vote for the Democrats in this by-election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has set out a program of tariff reductions and other assistance to the textiles, clothing and footwear industry to the year 2000. That will result in assistance to this industry this year being something like 10 times what it is for the manufacturing industry generally; in 1996 it will be eight times what it is for the manufacturing industry generally; and in the year 2000 it will be something like eight to 10 times what it is for the manufacturing industry generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alternative which the industry is confronted with is having no tariffs at all, if the shadow spokesman can be believed. He believes that wonderful things will happen for this industry and other industries as a result of the program announced by the Opposition. I make it quite clear that I do not believe in that. I believe that the Government was wise and sensible to allocate money in the One Nation package to support firms in the process of restructuring in this industry. The Government will be doing that. A considerable amount of money was allocated in the One Nation statement for that purpose.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of that conference; I think I had discussions with somebody who was at it. One of the important issues resolved by the conference in Spain was the allocation of spectrum for a new technology in which low earth orbit satellites provide global voice and data telecommunications services. That technology is already in an advanced state of development. Motorola's iridium project, to which Senator Schacht refers, is one of these proposals and Australian interests will be able to participate in these developments in a number of ways. There are opportunities for investors, satellite gateway operators, service providers, launch contractors and end users.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of Woomera as a possible launch site for these low earth orbit satellites has been raised by a joint venture comprising British Aerospace Australia, Auspace and Hawker de Havilland. That joint venture is called Southern Launch Vehicles. British Aerospace is the lead company in the joint venture. It has had discussions with the South Australian Government and the Commonwealth Government. Senator Schacht is probably aware that presentations were given by the Motorola Corporation and others to members of parliament last year about the use of the same or similar technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the South Australian Government and the Commonwealth Government are aware of the potential of the project.

With regard to that part of the question relating to the MFP, space activity is seen as a promising component of that concept, but it would certainly have to wait a while until we get the results of this feasibility study and so on.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the intention of Australian Defence Industries to close the Footscray, Maribyrnong and St Marys ammunition facilities and replace them with a state-of-the-art ammunition factory. The decision was to go to Benalla. An important aspect of this is, of course, to keep an excess capacity within this country if we are ever threatened. There was quite hot competition from a number of sites. In the end, ADI chose Benalla.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the announcement of that decision, we had an outburst from Minister Michael Yabsley in which he described this result as, firstly, cronyism; secondly, the Federal Government using raw political muscle; and, thirdly, blatant political interference. We then had Mr Greiner say, as reported by the local Penrith newspaper, that he was considering the blocking of the redevelopment of the St Marys site in retaliation for what he sees as political interference. He then wrote a letter to the Prime Minister and changed his tack. He said that he wanted the better cities program not to go to St Marys because he was worried about contamination of the site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, yesterday we had the planning Minister, Mr Webster, say on the ABC news that New South Wales would make it difficult for ADI to finance the new munitions plant from the sale of the St Marys land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress that ADI made a unanimous and independent decision to go to Benalla. In a letter to Mr Greiner, the Chairman of ADI says:</PARA>

<PARA>It is an irony in some ways that the last three board members I have appointed to ADI are all resident in New South Wales. The overwhelming activity of ADI will remain in New South Wales. I believe that the New South Wales Government's reaction is both spiteful and narrow-minded. I wonder why it was so curiously silent when New South Wales was awarded the submarine maintenance refit contracts, and when we were under enormous pressure, as Senator Panizza would acknowledge, from Western Australia to put the contract there for political reasons? We resisted that. New South Wales, of course, remained silent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens if the St Marys site is not redeveloped? Firstly, this country forfeits the opportunity for a modern ammunition factory. But I think that is the minor consideration here. What Sydney will forfeit is the redevelopment of an enormous tract of land in the middle of Sydney. St Marys is 1,535 hectares in size&mdash;right in the middle of urban Sydney. We have plans for housing, for light industrial development, for recreational uses and for conservation zones in that area. What the New South Wales Government is really saying is that a model urban development for the middle of Sydney will be sacrificed out of spite.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, we have seen in Sydney politics the Eastern Creek syndrome at work, but we in Defence have no intention of retaliating against New South Wales. We will continue to cooperate with the New South Wales Government, trying to vacate the land at Newington so as to enhance its Olympic bid. We will continue to press for removal of the ammunition pipeline that runs right through suburban Sydney. If New South Wales fairly wins contracts, as it did recently to do the initial flight training at Tamworth, we, as a Federal Government, will not interfere when it wins on commercial grounds. Finally, if ADI does, as I suspect it will, move its corporate headquarters to Sydney, we will not take any notice of complaints by other governments about political bias.</PARA>

I also mention his strong urging that the Federal Government get its act together, and his reference to the forced sacking of 34 workers from Minproc's Gladstone plant because of dumped sodium cyanide. As part of the Anti-Dumping Authority's positive finding on dumping, dumping duties were imposed against imports from Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea and the United Kingdom, but the United States producer Du Pont was required only to give a written assurance to the ADA that it would not dump into the Australian market.</PARA></TALK.START>

We have had this discussion before, but let me make it quite clear that no anti-dumping regime can exclude all imports.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of that response, last Friday I wrote to Deputy President Munro acting on the public interest provisions of the Industrial Relations Act and asked him to call the parties before him in a conference in order that what is clearly a situation of industrial conflict could be brought within the proper channels of the Industrial Relations Commission and dealt with by the Commission.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's response is not to judge the circumstances in this case but really to encourage the parties to talk to one another, to try to settle the issue, to have resort to the Commission and, if they themselves voluntarily do not make the application, to be required to have resort to the Commission to bring about a settlement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister for Shipping and Aviation and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia. Each of those capacities is very vital to this question. Is the Minister aware that the current agreement between the north Queensland emergency response group and the Queensland Government has been cancelled, apparently to enable all services to be brought under the auspices of the State emergency services department? There is considerable confusion, uncertainty and concern about the nature of the new service and especially the retention of the experienced professional team responsible for north Queensland search and rescue, including international hospital transfers. Can the Minister clarify Federal responsibility in relation to this vital service? Will he seek urgent coordination of discussions between all relevant Ministers and their departments to ensure that there is no diminution of this vital service? In particular, can these talks be held promptly because, already, notices have been issued and staff will be retrenched as from the middle of April? If we are not careful we will find that there will be no emergency services out of Townsville.</PARA></TALK.START>

This matter is a State Government responsibility, not a Federal Government responsibility. I am aware of the very good work that is being done by the North Queensland Emergency Response Group. I have visited its headquarters in Townsville and seen it at first hand. Rather than jeopardising the essential rescue work that goes on in far north Queensland, the Queensland Government is moving to secure the long term viability of these services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Warburton has advised me that the North Queensland Emergency Response Group is in financial difficulties and is not currently commercially viable. Following consultation with the group, the State Government has announced that these services will continue to be conducted until 30 June and this will be financed by the Queensland Government. The Government will provide the financial resources for these services to continue but in the meantime it has called for tenders for emergency services work. It is planned that the successful tenderer will take over services from 1 July to ensure that there is no disruption to the provision of these services. Mr Warburton has advised me that the current proposal will ensure a long term solution to the continuation of these emergency services and make sure that they are placed on a sound and viable financial footing.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1. Yes. The Medicare safety net applies for the calendar year commencing on 1 January of any year and ending 31 December of that year. From 1 January 1992 the safety net threshold of $246 was extended to cover families as well as individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">2. Yes. The safety net provisions were changed late last year from a financial year to a calendar year basis. These changes were applied retrospectively to 1 January 1991 to facilitate the changes as they applied to the individual over the transitional period. The introduction of a calendar year basis brought the Medicare safety net into line with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme safety net and enabled the early introduction of the family based safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">3. No. In the calendar year 1991, no individual had to pay more than $246 in "gap" costs (ie the difference between the schedule fee or fee charged, whichever is the lower, and the benefit payable) before safety net provisions came into effect. Similarly, in the calendar year 1992, no individual or registered family will have to pay more than $246 in "gap costs. With the change to a calendar year and a family basis for the safety net, transitional provisions were introduced to facilitate the changes for individuals in the 1991 calendar year. Any out of pocket costs, up to the schedule fee, that were incurred at any time during 1991 were counted for safety net purposes in 1991. The Health Insurance Commission has been notifying anyone who paid at least S246 in "gap" costs during this period and refunding the "gap" amounts incurred in excess of that $246. Because of the change to a calendar year many individuals will receive extra benefits for medical services in 1991.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XG4">Senator GILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 5 December 1991, I gave notice of a motion of disallowance of the regulations. I also incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard </EMPHASIS>a statement of the concerns of the Committee. These concerns related to certificates, issued under the Freedom of Information Act, which conclusively determine that material in documents is exempt from public disclosure under the Act. These certificates may cover material relating to national security, defence or international relations; relations with the States; Cabinet; the Executive Council; or internal working documents&mdash;a relatively narrow range of sensitive material.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulations provide that these certificates remain in force for five years, although they may be revoked earlier by the Minister or senior officials. The period of five years appeared excessive, and there was no procedure under which a member of the public could request revocation, with AAT review of any refusal. The explanatory statement, which we understand was prepared in the Department, gave no explanation of why five years was chosen or why there were no apparent procedures for public participation in revocation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee wrote to the Minister with its concerns and received a helpful reply, the quality of which was in contrast to the explanatory statement. The Minister advised that the purpose of the regulations was to effect aspects of the Government's response to a 1987 report by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the operation and administration of the freedom of information legislation. That report had recommended two years duration for conclusive certificates. However, the Government response to the report was that two years was not long enough, but that a reasonable duration should be prescribed. The Government also accepted that regulations should clarify the power to revoke certificates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This reply from the Minister put the matter into its correct context and enabled the Committee to focus on the main issues. The Committee then asked the Attorney whether officials of the Department could brief the Committee. However, the officials were singularly unable to provide any real reasons to justify the longer period. Indeed, the Committee was told that the Department was unaware of the notice of motion of disallowance upon these regulations, even though it had been on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> for three months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This seemed to indicate certain defects of management. If the explanatory statements had been of acceptable quality, and if the Department had noted the serious reservations of the Committee about the regulations, time and resources could have been saved. In the event, the Committee has now agreed to accept the regulations, despite some fairly serious misgivings. One reason for accepting is that if the regulations were disallowed the previous position would continue and conclusive certificates would remain in force indefinitely. At least these regulations are an improvement on the previous position, although not to the same degree as we would have wished and not to the extent recommended by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case there was one view in the Committee that half a loaf was better than none and that none of the principles under which the Committee operates had been breached to the extent that disallowance could be justified. There was another view that concerns of the Committee had not been adequately addressed by the Attorney-General, Mr Duffy. The Committee is grateful for the courteous assistance it has received from the Attorney-General during his consideration of this matter. As usual, I seek leave to incorporate the Committee's correspondence in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations provide that conclusive exemption certificates, which exclude public disclosure of certain material in documents, remain in force for five years. However, they may be revoked earlier by the Minister or specified senior officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is concerned at the length of the five year period. There is no explanation in the Explanatory Statement why five years was chosen as appropriate. The Committee believes that the period of exclusion should be reasonable, and half a decade may be excessive, particularly for internal working documents. The present position seems to be that if a conclusive exemptions certificate is issued then the public is automatically denied access to the document for five years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee appreciates that the Minister or certain senior officers may revoke a certificate during those five years. However, it is not clear whether there is any process through which the public can request a revocation and whether there is AAT review if such a request is refused.

As drafted, it appears that the public may be shut out of any process at all in respect of such certificates for at least five years.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 12 December 1991 concerning the Freedom of Information (Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1991 No. 321.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its 1987 Report on the Operation and Administration of the Freedom of Information (FOI) Legislation recommended that conclusive certificates issued under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 remain in force for two years only from the date of issue. In responding to the report the Government rejected this recommendation as it considered that the period of two years was too short. Many documents do not lose their sensitivity in such a short period. The Government accepted, however, that certificates should cease to have effect after a reasonable period and proposed that this period should be specified in regulations made under the Act. Regulation 5A implements this proposal by specifying 5 years which is considered an appropriate period. Prior to the amendment of the Act and the Regulations, certificates remained in force indefinitely.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a certificate is issued an applicant for documents already has a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). The AAT has the power to determine whether reasonable grounds exist for the claims made in the certificate and to recommend the revocation of a certificate. A Minister who fails to follow such a recommendation is required under section 58A to;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. notify the applicant of the Minister's decision including all material findings of fact and reasons for decision; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. table a copy of that notice in each house of Parliament within 5 sitting days.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The practical effect of an FOI request or an application to the AAT is the review of the continuing need for the certificate. Where the certificate is not revoked, a review will be required to advise the Minister whether, in the event that the AAT determines there are no reasonable grounds for the claims made in the certificate and the certificate should be revoked, the Minister should accept the recommendation or reject it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the specific review procedures there is nothing to prevent the revocation of a certificate within the 5 year period and the procedure for doing so has been clarified by the new regulation 5B which was introduced at the same time as the 5 year period in regulation 5A.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, conclusive certificates, representing as they do concern at the highest levels that an exemption claim may be overturned by the AAT, are rarely issued. My department has always stressed in its advice to agencies, that conclusive certificates should only be issued where documents deal with matters of the highest sensitivity. I note that the Senate Standing Committee reviewing the FOI legislation in 1987 was "favourably impressed by the restraint with which conclusive certificates have been issued" (paragraph 9.4).</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 10 February 1992 on aspects raised by the Committee of the Freedom of Information (Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1991 No. 321. The Committee considered your letter at its meeting on 27 February 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is grateful for your advice, which gave a comprehensive survey of important issues connected with conclusive certificates. However, the Committee believes that its consideration of this matter would benefit from a talk with an officer of your Department. Accordingly it would be appreciated if an officer or officers could attend the next meeting of the Committee at 8.30 a.m. in Committee Room 1S6 in Parliament House on Thursday 5 March 1992. If this is agreeable could you arrange for the Secretary of this Committee to be told the names of the officers attending (telephone 277-3066). I expect that the talk with your officers will be reasonably brief.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I emphasise that the Committee regards your letter of 10 February as a good quality response to our concerns. Nevertheless, there are some further matters which could best be resolved by personal contact with appropriate officers of your Department.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Giles</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 28 February 1992 regarding my advice on the Freedom of Information (Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1991 No. 321 (the Regulations) and the Committee's discussions with Departmental Officers on 5 March 1991. At that discussion the Committee sought further information on the Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You gave notice of disallowance of the Regulations which expires on 24 March 1992. I provide further information for consideration on the disallowance motion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the expiration of a conclusive certificate after 5 years instead of the 2 years as recommended by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs the Government adheres to its view that the 2 year period is too short. However the Government has accepted the Senate Committee's recommendation that the present indefinite operation of conclusive certificates as provided by the present legislation is inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusive certificates are able to be issued only in respect of documents affecting national security, defence or international relations (s.33), documents affecting relations with the States (s.33A), Cabinet documents (s.34), Executive Council documents (s.35) and internal working documents (s.36). Such certificates are issued only at the highest levels and where the documents deal with manners of the highest sensitivity. In practice, such certificates are usually only issued where an applicant for access to the documents seeks review of the initial refusal for access and there is a concern that the exemption claim may be overturned by the AAT. The sensitivity attaching to these types of documents is not quickly reduced and to adopt the 2 years suggested by the Standing Committee would require regular re-issuing of conclusive certificates which would be an inefficient use of resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 5 year period adopted in the Regulations is a compromise between, in some cases, the sensitivity being sufficiently reduced to no longer require re-issuing of the certificate and the inefficiency caused by continual reconsideration of documents. Were the Senate to disallow the provision, the result would, of course, be that the present indefinite period for conclusive certificates, would remain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusive certificates are rarely issued. Although no statistics are kept, discussions with departmental officers, which is consistent with AAT review figures, indicate that only the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet issues such certificates with any regularity. Since 1986 that Department has issued a total of only 33 certificates&mdash;5 under Section 33, 21 under section 34 and 7 under section 36 of the FOI Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Departmental officer was asked about the length of delays in AAT cases on conclusive certificates. Unfortunately no statistics are kept as of course and to ascertain it would be very resource intensive. However, in respect of FOI cases, the AAT has provided a schedule on the numbers and delays. I attach a copy of that schedule for your information.</PARA>

Before we go home tonight at 10.30 we have to have considered the report; discussed it with our various parties, if we are members of parties; made a decision as to whether we will go along with the procedure one way or the other; and, if a number of senators&mdash;apparently Senator Bishop is one of them&mdash;intend to continue with the motion for disallowance, we have to debate that today.</PARA>

If I have guessed correctly, the Minister wrote to the Committee today, the Committee received the letter today, and today has been the first opportunity the Committee has had to tell the Senate what is going on. That results in the Senate being stuck with a situation where, on a matter which quite clearly is controversial, we have to give consideration to that matter, make a decision, debate it and vote on it today.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The February 1992 Advance to the Minister for Finance represents two characteristics of the Government that we have come to see increasingly over recent months&mdash;first, that the Government has quite clearly lost control of its financial situation and we are seeing a progressive unravelling of the Budget day by day; secondly, that the policies of the Government are causing suffering to a large number of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the financial position of the Government is concerned, it is quite clear from this statement, and from other actions, that control of the Government's finances has collapsed. We have seen today the need for the Government to introduce a special additional appropriations Bill to stop its key programs&mdash;including child-care relief, residential care for elderly persons, and various labour market programs&mdash;from running out of money in the next few weeks. Despite the fact that only four weeks ago the Government introduced the normal additional appropriations legislation, ostensibly to cover those requirements, and the fact that the normal parliamentary process of consideration of those Additional Estimates has not been delayed in any way, we find, without adequate explanation, that the situation has so changed that the Government has to introduce another special additional appropriations Bill, and, in so doing, amend the Appropriation Bills currently before the Senate in order to delete the items which will be the subject matter of the new Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons why that has happened is presumably that not enough money is remaining in the Advance to the Minister for Finance to fund those programs over a temporary period, and we are talking about a period of only a few weeks. I have spoken on this subject many times in the past in the Senate and will continue to do so. I believe that there needs to be a major review of the whole of the operations of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extraordinarily difficult to discern what is happening to that fund. No consolidation of the activities of the fund is presented to the Parliament on any regular basis, other than its monthly usage, but that does not give a consolidated accumulative total of its use for the year and so on. I believe that there is a need for a considerable review and overhaul of the Advance to the Minister for Finance, certainly so far as the Senate's involvement in it is concerned. The need to draw on the Advance to the Minister for Finance to the tune of almost $27m in this month alone is testimony also to the financial budgetary incompetence and irresponsibility of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the second point I raised is concerned&mdash;namely the great deal of suffering that is being caused to the people of Australia as a result of the recession caused directly, and so admitted, by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;nothing could highlight that more starkly than the fact that the February Advance requires urgent funds for emergency relief and crisis accommodation. An additional $3.5m is being sought this month alone. That is equivalent to a very substantial 35 per cent increase over the Budget and it drives home very starkly indeed the pain and the very real hardship being experienced by the people of Australia, particularly those people on low incomes, as a result of the policies of the Government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a very important report that comes before the Parliament each year. It is a report which is prepared on the instructions of the Attorney-General. As pointed out in chapter 1 of the report, division 2, part IX of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 requires the Attorney-General as Minister administering the Act to have prepared each year a report providing details concerning interceptions of telecommunications for law enforcement purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, there is no doubt that the interception of telephone calls and telegrams as well&mdash;although I do not know how many telegrams are sent these days&mdash;is a very great intrusion into the privacy of people and that privacy should be interfered with only for the most serious of matters. The Act takes cognisance of that by requiring applications for warrants to be sworn and presented to higher judicial officers for permission. Of course, the difficulty is that there is no real check on the material that is set out by the authorities which are applying for the warrants. I notice in table 1 that the agencies that have applied for warrants under part 6 of the Act have included the Australian Federal Police, the National Crime Authority, the New South Wales Police, the New South Wales Crime Commission, ICAC and the Victorian Police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988-89 a total of 246 warrants were sought; in 1989-90, 340 warrants were sought; and in 1990-91, 380 warrants were sought. Very few have been refused; as I look down the list I can see only one in 1990-91 that was refused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The swearing out of warrants has a long tradition in the process by which crime is detected. Nevertheless, we as parliamentarians have to keep constantly in mind that there is&mdash;and always will be&mdash;a problem with the application for warrants. Warrants entitle investigating authorities to take the most drastic action in some circumstances against people's privacy and against their civil rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whenever a report such as this comes before the Parliament, it is appropriate that attention be paid to it and that the matter be raised, not in the sense of saying that people are not doing their job but in the sense of saying that this is a process which must be kept under surveillance&mdash;and we parliamentarians are the proper people to keep it under surveillance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great step to require investigating authorities to provide details, in terms of numbers, of the matters about which they apply for warrants. Of course, the details cannot be revealed, but the figures themselves are significant in enabling us to see whether there may be anything wrong with the process by which warrants are obtained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very few applications for warrants are refused. There are probably two reasons for that: first, there is no real evidence put to the contrary in the sense that there is nobody to challenge, to contradict, the evidence put forward by investigating authorities. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> Secondly, by and large, the law enforcement bodies in this country&mdash;in spite of the evidence we have from time to time that they do not always act with perfection&mdash;act responsibly and with integrity in applying for these warrants.</PARA>

This relates to the provision of a flood mitigation dam and various Aboriginal sites associated with that in and near Alice Springs. Naturally, that issue will not be dealt with in some detail until next year's report. I will be looking at the preliminary work highlighted in this report in that regard also.

<PARA>This also is a very important document in that it records the activities that have taken place in the northern region of the Northern Territory that comes under the auspices and the management and supervision of the Northern Land Council. The map on page 11 of the report highlights the Aboriginal land, the Land Council boundaries and the land under claim. I certainly commend it to honourable senators and any other interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I record that this report was available only several minutes before we had the opportunity to comment on it. It will invite more detailed scrutiny and observation. Many areas impact and impinge on the operations of organisations such as the Northern Land Council. By its very nature, much of its activities will be controversial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One point I highlight is that on page 31 of the report it is noted that from 1 July 1991 a new land council will be established with responsibility for Groote Eylandt and Bickerton Island in the Northern Territory. This is an important initiative of the Anindilyakwa Land Council. Next year, of course, we will see a report from that organisation as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw to the attention of the Senate that this important land council was created by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) following a plebiscite of the Aboriginal people of Groote Eylandt, Bickerton Island and south-east Arnhem Land. It is an irony and a pity that the Minister did not accept that there was a 67 per cent vote for the establishment of a land council in that part of Arnhem Land known as south-east Arnhem Land. A similar vote of support was certainly recorded for Groote Eylandt and the land council was established. But for purely political reasons, and certainly not for good reasons in any way associated with the development of Aboriginal people, the Labor Government has determined that a 67 per cent vote is not in accord with the wishes of the people it sought to poll in a plebiscite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the Minister will continue to work with the Aboriginal people of south-east Arnhem Land and will give them an equality of treatment similar to that afforded to the people of Groote Eylandt and that political favourites will not be played in this regard. When the Government comments on the very commendable actions that are taking place in South Africa but fails to apply similar principles to very important issues that it deals with in Australia, that is a matter that must attract attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not had occasion to read the reports of the chairman or the director or to study the accounting details that are presented in the report this year. I will certainly be looking for an assessment of the cooperation of the Northern Land Council with the Northern Territory Government and in particular the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy for the development of major resource projects. As we know, Coronation Hill is situated in the northern part of the Northern Territory. In the last year considerable controversy has surrounded the potential and the development of Coronation Hill and the aspirations and the wishes of the Jawoyn people. The Northern Land Council has certainly acted as an advocate on behalf of those people in many respects. </PARA>

The difference between the Parliament in Chile and the Parliament in this country is that the Executive is separate from the Parliament. There is a cut and thrust between the Parliament and the Executive that we sometimes do not have in this place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I wish to make a few comments about this question. The Senate will remember that during the first week of the parliamentary sittings this year, I nominated for the vacancy on the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I did so, recognising that I was the only Independent in the chamber and that the vacancy was for an Independent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly had no intention&mdash;and I made it clear&mdash;of preventing the replacement of Senator Vallentine from nominating when she eventually came into this chamber. Indeed, I indicated that I would, if appointed, resign my position from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and renominate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the event, my nomination was read out by the Presiding Officer at the time and there was no motion. The usual thing, of course, is for the duty Minister to move a motion that the nomination be received. At that particular stage, of course, I was the only Independent. As I said, in the event, this did not occur. So we have the situation whereby over the past month, I think&mdash;Senator Chamarette will remind me because she would know only too well how long she has been hanging in there waiting to be appointed&mdash;there has been no Independent on that particular Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, of course, have for many years had an interest in the area of foreign affairs, defence and, in a fairly narrow sense, trade. I will not go into that because I do not think it would be fair to do so. But I am concerned that a vote should have to be taken to choose which of us will go on the Committee. Each of us has legitimate interests. Senator Chamarette has legitimate interests in the operations of that Committee and so do I. </PARA>

My motion seeks to ensure that a senator who is not a member of a committee may participate in its public sessions and question witnesses&mdash;unless the committee orders otherwise&mdash;but shall not vote.

I suspect that it still has to be determined which of the two candidates aspiring to the position today is successful in the ballot. Senator Harradine may wish to explain to me why I am wrong, if I am wrong.

I had thought&mdash;apparently wrongly, according to Senator Harradine&mdash;that when a standing committee met, any senator was entitled to attend and to ask questions of witnesses but, of course, was not permitted to vote, and that at all times the committee was able to resolve itself into a private committee or perhaps even exclude the senator.

I was a member of that Joint Committee for some years in the past. Therefore, still having an interest in the Joint Committee as one senator and, I stress, as the Deputy Chairman of the Senate Committee in the same area, I made direct requests of the Joint Committee that I should be able to attend, but not ask questions at, any briefings it has at its regular Wednesday meetings and to keep the confidence of the Committee in the way that I did in the years when I was a member.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is an omnibus measure proposing a series of amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901. The main proposals contained in the Bill relate to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1)amendments to the Customs Act 1901 to provide the legislative framework for the electronic transmission to the Australian Customs Service of information concerning imported goods, and the electronic lodgement of import entries in respect of such goods;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2)amendments to the Customs Act 1901 provisions relating to the advance reporting regime for ships and aircraft and their cargo, passengers and crew, to enhance the operation of that Scheme; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3)amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901 to improve the accountability and administration of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme in response to the Audit Report by the Australian National Audit Office, No. 27 of 1990-91, tabled in Parliament on 16 May 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now refer briefly to each of those proposals:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1) Electronic Lodgement</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to activity worldwide in the area of electronic technology and its application to international trade, the Australian Customs Service has developed and is continuing to develop a number of electronic initiatives. Both public and private sectors are seeking to standardise industry procedures by pursuing the benefits of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), with the formation of a national communications network.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments in this Bill for the electronic communication and lodgement of import information are a<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> continuation of the improvements and updating of entry<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> facilities which were initiated by the EXIT amendments for<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> export information, introduced into the Customs Act by Act<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> No. 111 of 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similar to the EXIT scheme, the electronic lodgement system for imports, known as `COMPILE', will operate on the basis of legislative amendments and contractual arrangements between the Customs Service and users of the system. The proposed Principal Act legislative amendments are in a similar format and style to the successful EXIT amendments passed by this Parliament in the 1990 Budget Sittings, and will essentially introduce an electronic/computer option for the communication to Customs of information concerning imported goods, to complement the current documentary/manual entry facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The `COMPILE' system includes a sophisticated regime of profiles designed to identify consignments as `high risk', `potential risk' or `low risk' for both revenue and community protection issues. These profiles can be altered by Customs to target specific types of goods or destinations and can be further refined on the basis of intelligence and data relating to importing practices. Such intelligence is received from a wide variety of sources, both national and international. The profiles may also be amended on national and regional levels and therefore are sufficiently flexible to be able to address local issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`COMPILE' has been programmed to ask the User a series of questions to determine the exact nature of the goods being imported. In essence the information required under both the new electronic and the existing manual regimes is similar. When the full particulars of the goods have been keyed in, the COMPILE system has the facility to react to that information and make any necessary adjustment to the risk rating which applies to the goods. Immediately after transmission of an electronic entry, COMPILE will advise the user that the entry is available for any payment of duties which might be owing, or it will require the user to present documentation relating to the transaction if a risk has been identified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The potential savings for users in costs and time are significant. The majority of cargo is expected to be available for payment and Customs clearance in a matter of minutes after arrival in Australia. Savings in resources, staff and storage charges should be passed on to consumers in the form of cheaper commodity prices on imported goods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments are intended to not only provide a more formal link between the Principal Act and the user agreement, but also to deal with other important issues which flow from the entry requirements; in particular, providing a facility to make electronic payments under protest in Section 167, amendments in respect of liability for false or misleading statements, and Customs control over imported goods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Electronic Lodgement amendments are dealt with principally in Clauses 13 and 16 of the Bill, and are explained in greater detail in the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2) Cargo Reporting</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments contained in Clauses 8-12 of the Bill propose minor amendments to the advance reporting regime for ships and aircraft and their cargo and crew, which was introduced by Act No. 111 of 1990. The proposed amendments will enhance Customs' ability to fully risk-assess incoming cargo, crew and passengers for the detection of narcotics and other prohibited imports by ensuring that all advance reports are communicated to Customs at each port or airport of call in Australia rather than only at the first port or airport of arrival. This will ensure that Customs has the opportunity to coordinate its barrier enforcement needs whilst generally streamlining the reporting process, particularly with respect to those ships, aircraft, cargo, passengers and crew not considered to pose a high risk.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3) Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme Amendments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments relating to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme are designed to streamline the present claims procedures and improve the accountability and administration of the Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme provides for varying levels of rebate of either customs or excise duties to persons who purchase diesel fuel for certain prescribed off-road uses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Categories of eligible use which are defined in the legislation include mining operations, primary production, and diesel fuel for residential premises and medical institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following an efficiency audit of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme conducted earlier this year by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO), Audit Report No. 27 of 1990-91 was tabled in this Parliament on 16 May 1991. That report identified certain deficiencies in the current administration of the Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While some of the ANAO's recommendations are still the  subject of consideration by this Government, those elements in the report which are capable of immediate implementation are included in this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clauses 28 and 46 of the Bill remove from the Customs and Excise Acts the requirement to lodge original purchase invoices with each claim. It is considered that there is no need to provide in the Principal Acts the exact documentation required to accompany claims, as this type of mechanical provision is more appropriately dealt with by regulations. During the course of 1992, the Government expects to bring on new regulations to enable invoices to be replaced by a Schedule of fuel purchases prepared by the claimant. This is broadly in accordance with Recommendation 32 of the ANAO Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments contained in this part of the Bill are in accord with the Government's philosophy that rebate payments be based on self assessment by claimants and that claims and claimants be subject to periodic audit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other Amendments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the amendments outlined above, the Bill proposes a number of minor amendments to both the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901 which are explained in greater detail in the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost of implementing the Electronic Lodgement System (including development, implementation, maintenance and operational costs) has been estimated over the last<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> financial year and the next three financial years in present<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> dollar values as follows:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Freedom of Information (Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1991 No. 321 and made under the Freedom of Information Act 1982, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA>I rise to speak in support of this motion which now stands in my name and which formerly stood in the name of Senator Giles. I point out that I move this motion in my capacity as a member of the Senate, as distinct from my capacity as Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move this motion with an air of sadness because the history of the working of the Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has been one of bipartisan support. On many occasions I have risen in this chamber to support the remarks of the Chairman and stated that we have chosen always to work in the interests of the Parliament and the making of good legislation, and in accordance with our four principles. It is disappointing that on this occasion we have come to the situation where, after a vote within the Committee, it was resolved that the Committee would move to withdraw its motion of disallowance. I then sought, as an individual senator&mdash;I stress, not as a member of the Committee&mdash;to take over the moving of the disallowance motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Giles rose to indicate her intention to withdraw the disallowance motion, she tabled the correspondence that the Committee had received and made a short statement. I will quote part of her short statement because it is very germane to the way in which this matter has proceeded. The correspondence and the short statement outline the fact that the matter had been treated by the Committee very seriously, and that we had sought to persuade the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) that five years was too long a period for a conclusive certificate which would prevent access to documents under FOI legislation to be in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position is that until this time such a certificate has been of indefinite length. But in 1987, the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs presented a report on the operation and administration of the freedom of information legislation. In its recommendations, the Committee said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FOI Act makes no provision for the expiry of certificates. The Committee is of the view that it is unreasonable for a conclusive certificate to remain in force indefinitely. One submission suggested that `an applicant should be able to apply for a review of a conclusive certificate after a period of time, say three years after the decision' to issue it. Another suggestion was that the certificate should remain in force for only two years or perhaps until there was a change of Minister. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Committee recommends that conclusive certificates remain in force for only two years from the date of issue. However, the Committee does not consider that documents should be released automatically upon the lapse of a conclusive certificate.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, the Standing Committee envisaged that if it were considered necessary, the conclusive certificate could be reissued at the end of that period of two years but there would be a need for the Minister to reconsider the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Attorney-General's letters to the Committee there was simply a statement that the Government had rejected the two-year recommendation and was imposing a five-year period. There was no real discussion or reasons given for the five-year period being adequate or satisfactory, merely a statement that two years was too little. Accordingly, the Committee asked whether officials from the Attorney-General's Department could come and meet with it and perhaps explain the background which had led the Attorney-General to come to that conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two such gentlemen from the Department did meet with the Committee. Suffice it to say that the testimony they gave was totally and utterly inadequate. As Senator Giles said in her statement, the officials were singularly unable to provide any real reasons to justify the longer period. Indeed, the Committee was told that the Department was unaware of the notice of motion of disallowance upon these regulations even though it had been on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> for three months. Senator Giles went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This seemed to indicate certain defects of management. If the explanatory statement had been of acceptable quality, and if the Department had noted the serious reservations of the Committee about the regulations, time and resources could have been saved.</PARA>
<PARA>And, indeed, perhaps we could have come to a satisfactory compromise and a satisfactory conclusion. But it was not until today&mdash;the last day on which the disallowance motion can be dealt with or the regulations will simply come to an end&mdash;that we were notified as members of the Committee that we should meet at lunchtime. In a briefing note we were told that since 1 July 1986 there have been only 33 conclusive certificates issued&mdash;so we are not talking about a large workload. The final statement is, `It is hoped the Attorney-General will sign a letter to the Committee this morning'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letter we received was undated but it was marked as being received by our Committee today. It is for that reason that Senator Lewis, who spoke earlier, voiced a feeling that all members of the Senate are entitled to be informed and that there ought to have been time for discussion. But the Attorney-General's Department was tardy in dealing with this matter. Our secretariat is here at all times, even when we are not sitting. The matter could have been dealt with. We could have been notified and, if necessary, we could have met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now specifically to the Attorney-General's letter of even date. The third paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government adheres to its view that the 2 year period is too short.</PARA>
<PARA>He then says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However the Government has accepted the Senate Committee's recommendation that the present indefinite operation of conclusive certificates as provided by the present legislation is inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA>By the time we get to paragraph 5, there is in my view a veiled implication in the letter which I personally do not find acceptable. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Were the Senate to disallow the provision, the result would, of course, be that the present indefinite period for conclusive certificates, would remain.</PARA>
<PARA>Simply, those two statements do not sit together. That is a statement of fact&mdash;that when this is disallowed that will occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Attorney-General in his own letter has said that the Government has found the indefinite operation of a certificate unacceptable. Therefore, I can only expect&mdash;and, I am sure, other members of the Senate will expect&mdash;that when this existing regulation is disallowed, the Attorney-General will indeed make fresh regulations. Hopefully, he will accept the reasoning of the Committee and of individual senators that the period of five years is simply too long and that the period of two years, as recommended, certainly would be acceptable. But he may come back with another alternative&mdash;a period of three years&mdash;for which he may be able to give good reason. Indeed, he may be able to accept the reasoning, which the Committee considered, that at least the applicant or a member of the public should be able to ask for revocation of a certificate. It would not be simply a matter of the Executive&mdash;that is, the Minister himself&mdash;having a right to revoke and there being no opportunity for any member of the public affected by the certificate to make application to the Minister for him to consider a revocation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there are many ways in which this matter can be resolved. But simply to say, `It's five years, and that's the only thing we'll consider' is not, in my view and that of other senators, an acceptable way to proceed. It is important from the Committee's point of view that Ministers know and that members of the Senate know that at all times we, as members of the Committee, have in our minds that at the end of the day regulations must be made which are as effective as any Act of parliament. They must be just as effective in determining how people are affected by the law. Those regulations have to be properly scrutinised by the Committee in accordance with four principles. We need to ensure that individuals' rights are protected; that there is proper review; that we do not have regulations instead of legislation; and that regulations come within the confines and the power of the enabling legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress again that in viewing the reputation and standing of the Committee and the work it does, members of the Executive and members of parliament must have those four principles paramount in their mind at all times. When we go to a member of the Executive, to a Minister, there must always be room for us to negotiate and say, `The way this regulation has been made is not serving the interests of the people; this is a better way of doing it'. I have not moved this motion in any flippant or, indeed, partisan manner. I have moved it because I believe that it is the best way to proceed. I stress again: I have moved this motion as an individual member of the Senate and not as Deputy Chairman of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, in disallowing this regulation, we are leaving the way open for the Attorney-General to come back with fresh regulations which will mean that the interests of the individual will be served and that the freedom of information legislation will act in the way in which it was meant to in serving the interests of individual Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, in looking at the issues we are discussing today, and reporting in December 1987, recommended&mdash;I think one member dissented from the recommendations&mdash;that conclusive certificates remain in force for only two years from the date of issue. That is the point being discussed currently. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) brought down regulations that meant that this time limit was five years. The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances had expressed concern that that was too long. Senator Bishop has adequately outlined the process that went on in our asking to see people from the Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things I expressed concern about was that officers of a department responsible for regulations were not aware that the disallowance motion had been on the table of the chamber. They did not seem to be aware of nor concerned about the fact that the Regulations and Ordinances Committee had expressed its concern. I have found that since I have been on the Committee, usually when the Committee goes to a Minister with a concern&mdash;and it is well thought through; we do not go in any light-hearted way to a Minister to ask for a regulation to be altered&mdash;the Minister will oblige by meeting the requirements or request of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case the Minister did not. The officers did not seem very aware. One of the things we did was to allow this to continue so that we could get a response from the Minister. Senator Giles wrote to the Minister during the last sitting fortnight. When did we get the reply? We received it on 24 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Lewis said, because of the confidentiality and the nature of this Committee we are obliged not to show any correspondence or discuss any issues that the Committee discusses until the documentation has been tabled. As far as members of the Committee on both sides of the chamber go, those issues are not discussed. What goes on in that Committee is kept within the Committee. It is as tight as tight can be. On this occasion, when we were asked why we were expressing concern, we were not able to show our colleagues any of the correspondence today because it had not been tabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Bishop said, had the Minister given us an earlier answer we could have had a meeting of the Committee yesterday. We would have had time to table the documentation immediately after Question Time and at least have had some time to discuss it. But we have not had that. The whole thing has not been handled very well in terms of enabling us to do our job properly and enabling the Senate to consider the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of concern to me, and an issue that the Minister has raised, is that if the regulations are disallowed, then the present indefinite period for conclusive certificates would remain. Often the word `dilemma' is used wrongly, but I was in a dilemma on the Committee because, on the one hand, I believed that the two-year limit should obtain and, on the other hand, I faced the fact that if the regulations were disallowed the present indefinite period for conclusive certificates would remain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my concerns is that one can always be held over a barrel. If a regulation is brought down that partly meets the concern or meets the concern in a time frame, you are then put in a cleft stick of saying, `I will agree with that because if I do not the situation will be worse'. It would have been appropriate for the Minister to have addressed the issue because of the overwhelming concern by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. The Minister may have obliged us by re-issuing the regulations with a two-year period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very sad that we have reached this point today and that it could not have been resolved by the Minister. I am equally concerned with the issue that Senator Austin Lewis raised, which is that our colleagues have not had time to look at carefully, and to come to a considered decision about, the disallowance of these regulations, all because it has not been handled sensitively and appropriately by the Minister and his officers. It goes to show that we still need to educate many people about the role of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. It also shows that we need to be very careful that we do not set a precedent that one is held over a barrel on a set of regulations. </PARA>

However, the Australian Democrats believe that freedom of information should mean what it says, and that individual citizens should have maximum access to government documents&mdash;maximum access, that is, that is compatible with security interests and the high level of confidentiality concerns that a government legitimately has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, the Australian Democrats agree very much with the opinion expressed earlier by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances when the Committee said that five years was too long and that two years was a more appropriate period. The Australian Democrats are not convinced by the arguments put forward by the Minister that five years is impractical. There is nothing to prevent the Minister from reissuing such a certificate when the period of two years has nearly elapsed. On that basis we believe that the balance of judgment in this issue must be in favour of citizens wishing to gain access to government documents, and I confirm that the Australian Democrats will vote in favour of the disallowance motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel very much in the position of those judges who are sometimes asked to give extempore decisions. I apologise if any of my reasoning is not quite as rigid as I might have hoped. This matter is of grave concern to me because it placed those of us who were on the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances in a certain bind. Most members of the Committee were very concerned that the time period provided in the regulations seemed a little long. Certainly it was longer than the period that was originally recommended in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question, therefore, boiled down to this: should we as individuals exercise a judgment to strike down these regulations, recognising the possibility that, in so doing, the Government may not bring forward new regulations and so the old indefinite time period would remain? The question was: how was the freedom of the individual to be better served? Was it to be better served by striking down the regulations as being unsatisfactory, or was it better served by accepting them, as opposed to the otherwise existing situation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My view is that the regulations as made and brought before the Senate were unsatisfactory. I have a major reservation here in so far as the power of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances is concerned, and that is this: if the Senate were to say that a particular regulation which was of a character repugnant to some members of the Committee and repugnant to many senators could be allowed to remain in effect simply because it was better than repealing it and having an even more unsatisfactory situation, then I believe that we run the very grave risk of hamstringing not only the Senate but also a very fine Committee, the members of which endeavour as best as they can to be totally non-partisan in their views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern was that, if we did this, we would effectively be saying to any government department or to any Minister who was so disposed, that a half satisfactory regulation was better than no regulation at all. Of course, that would create the precedent that Ministers or departments could bring forward delegated legislation which appeared to be permissive in character but was in fact not so permissive because it might contain other portions or other clauses in the legislation which constrained other liberties. On the one hand the regulation may grant a freedom or liberty, but on the other hand it may take away another freedom or liberty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That would require the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances to make a value judgment between one liberty and another. I do not believe that it is the proper role of that Senate Standing Committee to make that judgment. Accordingly, I thought it was unsatisfactory that the Committee should be placed in this position by the Minister and by the tardiness with which both the Attorney-General and his Department dealt with the very real concerns of the Committee. That was my first area of reservation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These regulations are very important because, unlike the previous regulations, they recognise the principle that the effluxion of time of itself may be sufficient to release, or justify releasing, a certain matter from the scope of a conclusive certificate. That is very important because previously, when there was an indefinite period of time for which the conclusive certificate applied, it could only be released from the provisions of that conclusive certificate by virtue of a positive act&mdash;a revocation made with a residual power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These regulations now say that the effluxion of time of itself is sufficient. If that is the case, what then is the appropriate period of time? That is why I feel that two years is more appropriate, particularly since these regulations do not allow scope for an individual to make application for review of the determination behind the conclusive certificate. For those reasons I believe that these regulations should be disallowed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to talk on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill, because the Bill now before the Senate makes a number of changes to the operation of the existing child support legislation. It is designed to introduce more flexible appeal mechanisms and collection arrangements. It is designed to enhance the powers of the Registrar of Child Support to recover amounts that are outstanding and generally extend the scheme eligibility in respect of children subject to child welfare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would say that these changes are overdue, even though the Act itself has not been in existence for very long and certainly flexibility is required. During the course of my remarks on this Bill I will be alleging that there are a number of things wrong with the way the Child Support Agency is operating and I will be suggesting that there are things wrong with the formula upon which the calculations are made. Perhaps you, Mr Acting Deputy President, have heard me speak previously on this matter when bringing before the Senate problems that have arisen with the Child Support Act. I want to stress that, for the most part, it is legislation which we supported and which we do support, but we would like changes made to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In being critical of what has happened since the legislation came into operation, I am not suggesting that it should be abandoned. It has been in force now for some three years and there have been considerable successes which I will refer to, but there have been some failures. We have had the benefit of the report of Mr Justice Fogarty, Chairman of the Child Support Evaluation Advisory Group, which came into the Senate only a couple of weeks ago. The report consists of two volumes which are pretty weighty and contain quite a lot to read. Mr Justice Fogarty quite rightly points out that there has been a marked changed in public attitude to child maintenance since this Act came into operation. I will quote from Mr Justice Fogarty's report where he states that the extent to which parents should support their own children compared with the responsibility of the community to do so through social welfare is significant. He also considered whether it was possible to introduce a formula for the calculation of child support liabilities and whether enforcement through the Australian Taxation Office was desirable and would be effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is now an acknowledgment by the vast majority of Australians that the responsibility for the support of children should primarily lie with the parents. Mr Justice Fogarty summarised the current situation as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The debate now is not whether child support should be assessed by a formula but whether the formula in Australia is satisfactory or whether it can be improved. The debate now is not whether child support obligations should be enforced through the Taxation Office but whether its procedures need to be improved so as to become more efficient and effective.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, the scheme has had considerable success. When we think back to what existed previously, it is a vast improvement. I want to refer to a few facts. The average court order for maintenance has increased from $26 per child per week in 1988 to about $42 per child per week in 1991. The average stage 2 assessment is about $49 per child per week. The number of sole parent pensioners now receiving maintenance has increased from 26 per cent to almost 40 per cent. The agency now collects and distributes over $11m each month in child support payments. The collection rate has increased from 34 per cent in the years before the scheme to 65 per cent at present. I hope it will go much higher than 65 per cent, but one cannot deny the incredible increase that has occurred. Also, there has been a significant increase in payments outside the scheme by private arrangements between parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, in 1989-90 the scheme saved taxpayers something in the order of $35.5m. It is not the only criterion of success, but for taxpayers it is a pretty significant one. However, these successes cannot be allowed to overshadow the significant problems and distress which have been caused to a number of those involved. I would think that every member of this Parliament, in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, has been deluged with complaints, but not just coming from one side of the argument&mdash;not just those who are paying&mdash;but from both custodial parents and non-custodial parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to review now some of the problems which have arisen with the operation of this scheme. The explanatory memorandum to the Bill that was brought in in 1989 said in part that the Bill was intended to establish a scheme which ensures that access to child support is simple, timely, flexible and respects personal privacy. To an extent the Act has fallen down in relation to each of those criteria and there are considerable inadequacies which constituents have had difficulty coming to grips with. As I said, both custodial and non-custodial parents have complained about the scheme itself, the formula and its administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complaints, in a sense, fall into four categories:  complaints by custodial parents that the money they receive takes too long to arrive and, in many instances, is still insufficient to raise children; complaints by non-custodial parents that the formula is too harsh and too inflexible; complaints by the subsequent partners of non-custodial parents that the amount of money that a non-custodial parent has to pay has no regard for the fact that a person may wish to establish a second marriage&mdash;a second family&mdash;and get on with living; complaints by clients about the extreme difficulty in communicating with the Agency and receiving adequate and prompt responses from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme is seen by many as inflexible and incapable of allowing for individual cases and peculiarities. Perhaps that is inevitable when one resorts to a formula. Perhaps there is no other way. The previous way of orders of the court certainly did not work from two points of view: firstly, the amount of maintenance being ordered for people to pay&mdash;and I will come back to that; secondly, the enforcement of court orders. The orders made by the court, which I referred to, were previously and frequently consent orders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the normal course of matrimonial proceedings one would have to say that the arrangements made for the welfare of children by parents who were formerly married should be the best arrangements and that the court ought not lightly interfere with what the parents agree to. But the fact is that from the beginning of this Act, parents made arrangements which took into account the level of social security that the custodial parent could get and kept the maintenance payment at the minimum that enabled the parent to get the maximum social security payment. Many of us who were involved in the Act for a very long time objected to that and tried to have it changed. In my opinion, that was where it all went wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I referred to the figure of the average maintenance as being $26 a week. If one had two children and paid $26 a week, the custodial parent got the maximum amount from social security. There were times when other payments were made in addition to that and that seemed to be fairly common knowledge. In my view, the fact that the situation got as far out of hand as it finally did flowed from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Council of Australia has raised concerns about the formula which now exists. The alternative to having a court decision or an agreed decision probably has to be a formula. I think just about all of us in this chamber agreed to the formula when it went through. We find that its operation now is not sufficiently flexible and does not take into account a number of factors which, I believe, it must. Further changes need to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not take into account the different ages of the children being dealt with; financial responsibilities and resources; other incomes that the parties might have; the income of the custodial parent; the children's independent financial resources, perhaps&mdash;not in many cases, but in some, and that ought to be taken into account&mdash;the varying costs of accommodation which one custodial parent has to pay as against another. The formula lacks flexibility in this sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most disturbing problems of the issues which has come before the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act&mdash;a committee on which I am currently serving&mdash;relates to these issues. The Child Support Agency is not specifically a reference before us. Certainly, in the more than 1,100 submissions that we have seen, it is the payment of maintenance&mdash;which is regarded as an unreasonably large proportion, given the fact that the custodial parent's income is not taken into account in the formula&mdash;that is the cause of a lot of the unhappiness and distress that we have heard about in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there is also in the community a low level of understanding of the formula and how it operates. I do not suggest that as a criticism of those who are complaining, but merely as a fact. I get back to the point that it is worth remembering that prior to the introduction of the child support scheme, three-quarters of non-custodial parents did not contribute to the support of their children. But I think there are still matters to be brought before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this Bill there is the question of the administrative review process. The Bill will now allow for the parent liable to be paying maintenance to have an assessment of child support reviewed by an independent person free of charge. Without legal representation, the cost of having the formula reviewed by the court from when it started until now has been absolutely prohibitive. One fellow&mdash;and it is mostly men in such instances&mdash;who was attempting to pay the money that he had to pay and live did not have a cent left in his pocket to go to a court to have the maintenance reviewed. But that was his only mechanism. It was useless trying to talk to the Australian Taxation Office about it. The formula was rigid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that this will be a mechanism which will be of value. I do not know whether it will work as the Government intends or whether it will need further modification. But it is proposed to encourage parties, in a sense, to go to mediation to try to work something out. I do not know how that can happen while the formula remains rigid. What woman is going to give up maintenance that the formula presently allows her to collect?  I think at some stage we need to hear a bit more about exactly how this will operate or what power the independent person will have to make a variation which is meaningful and lawful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will also end the mandatory requirement that pensioners register for collection by the CSA an amount of child support that arises from an administrative assessment and allows a pensioner to choose to have payments made direct. It will enhance the powers of the Registrar to recover. I think we all know that for those who are on salaries from which tax is deducted&mdash;PAYE employees&mdash;it is relatively easy to get the money and require the employer of that person to pay the money directly to the Tax Office. With somebody who is self-employed it has been fairly difficult. Where a self-employed person has money in a bank account, the Registrar will be able, through this amending legislation, to garnishee other moneys in a way that will free it up and make it work more readily. Senator Alston will be moving an amendment in relation to an aspect of that, which I support, but I shall not go into it in detail at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned that in the past consent orders were accepted by the court. Consent orders will now properly be subject to the scrutiny of the court. The consent order may vary the formula. But if there is a consent order, the court will look at it and make sure that it is, in a sense, in the interests of those involved on both sides. Payments made outside the agency arrangements can be taken into account more readily than at present. The enforcement of child support debts are dealt with when the person paying is not in Australia. There is a provision introduced in this Bill to set aside transactions which are designed to defeat the capacity of a person to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill proposes to remove the ability of pensioners to elect to end the liability of the non-custodial parent who is required to pay. It has been felt that there is a need to have an administrative method of ending liability, not merely the election of the parties. The Bill will eliminate the need for the agency to off-set liabilities that arise. It will be subject to child welfare law. They are just some of the other provisions which are included in the Bill that we are discussing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I get back to the formula itself. It is the formula that is the subject of a considerable number of complaints to members of parliament. It is currently being used to calculate the liability of a payer. It is rigid. It does not account for the actual financial needs and circumstances of the parties. No consideration is given to a new family which may be established as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need to highlight one of the anomalies in the formula itself which is causing great anxiety. Under the formula, the custodial parent is allowed an amount of up to the average weekly earnings before his or her income is counted in the assessment. A wife, in this instance, is allowed to earn $29,931 a year or $575 a week. Then she is allowed to deduct further moneys from her income for each child that she is caring for. But the husband, the non-custodial parent, is permitted only an allowance for living expenses. In today's figures that amounts to $7,584 a year or $145 a week. In many cases, that is totally unsatisfactory. One just cannot do it; one cannot live on that sort of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The formula can also ignore the fact that the custodial parent may be in a relatively good financial position and not in need of such high levels of child support as would result from the direct application of the formula to the payer without regard to the circumstances of the person receiving the money. The present arrangement of appeal to the Family Court is costly and cumbersome and the legal costs are not recoverable. There is no chance that these people, left on $145 a week, could appeal; there is no chance that they could put together the money to lodge an appeal. They are left feeling very angry indeed. They are frequently quite happy to pay maintenance, quite happy to be responsible for their children, but they are treated virtually as though they are criminals because they are not able to pay and they get resentful because of it. Resentment in the breakdown of marriage is one of the things we all need to be very careful to eliminate. The Bill before us addresses these problems to an extent. It will allow for the custodial or the liable parent to have an assessment in the manner I have referred to. I hope that works well because it is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the private agreements I mentioned earlier, it will be necessary and compulsory for pensioners to register for collection. In many cases where non-custodial parents have been happy to contribute over and above the minimum required level of maintenance there have been difficulties. I will cite shortly one example that encompasses just about every aspect of the problems that so many have. The Bill provides that pensioners may choose to have child support payments made to them privately and directly, although they retain the option to register for collection by the Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill, I suggest, still does not go far enough in attempting to solve some of these problems. There are complaints that the formula assumes that the custodial parent has the costs of a single parent and does not take into account the fact that when that parent remarries or is living in a de facto relationship there is considerably more money in the household. The income of non-custodial parents has to drop to 85 per cent of what they previously received before there is any reduction in the maintenance they are required to pay. The fact that the formula of prescribed payments is tied in with inflation means that the non-custodial parent's income is presumed to rise in tandem with inflation, which last year we know was much greater than this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final report of the evaluation of the child support scheme also draws attention to the unfairness of dividing the children of Australia between stage 1 and stage 2 by an arbitrary time line. Because nothing has been done about this situation, a substantial number of children in Australia continue to be significantly disadvantaged and many continue to live in poverty. They are not simple matters but they are matters which, I believe, still need to be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The administration of the scheme has also brought many complaints to those of us who have been interested in the area. Incredible delays have occurred between the making of a court order and the registration of a liability with the Agency, and between the lodgment of an application for maintenance to be collected by the Agency and the receipt of the first payment to the custodial parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have something to judge this by because previously these orders were registered by the collector of maintenance and the money was collected by him and paid out. It did not take anything like as long as it has been taking over the past couple of years. The initial delay has been between eight and nine weeks, and in some cases considerably longer. A parent with several children needs the money for food, clothing, the light bill and to run the household. A delay of eight to nine weeks is absolutely intolerable; it makes it impossible to budget and it makes it impossible to run the household. Some of these delays are well understood and explained but, with so many of them on a fixed income where the money is paid in by the employer, it is inexcusable. It certainly is an area of constant complaint to my office and to others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area of complaint has been the level of debt at which the Agency will intervene to enforce payment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>A woman who rang my office had been trying for a long time to get the Agency to respond. She was told eventually by someone on the phone that until the debt was something like $1,500 it was not worth pursuing. For someone trying to feed and clothe a family and to run a household, $1,500 arrears of maintenance is an incredibly large sum. It told me that somebody was very out of touch indeed in dealing with people who need money to run their households. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been incidents of wrong information being sent to people. Hopefully, that will not happen again. It certainly is undesirable that personal information should be sent to the wrong individual; it is highly distressing. People make phone calls to the Agency. For a long time in Canberra one could get somewhere only by ringing Sydney. Certainly one could ring a 008 number, but that did not avoid the frustration of not being able to get an answer. That has been the experience not only of clients of the Agency but of all of us. People from our offices have rung and rung and got a different person every time they called. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complaints include inconsistency in response from the Agency and, on occasions, rudeness from the staff. I believe that the staff probably have not had sufficient training for the area they are working in and that there are not sufficient of them to do the job. We have set up a very large enterprise to pay money through the Taxation Office and out in this fashion, which I said at the beginning I support; but I am not sure that we have put the right infrastructure in place to enable it to be done as it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People feel that they are treated without dignity. They can never get the name of the person on the other end of the phone and ring back and feel that the same person is taking an interest in their problems. There have been errors in calculating the payments owed to parents; long delays on the telephone; long delays in getting answers to correspondence, particularly in the regional areas. Being a senator from Queensland, Mr Deputy President, you have probably experienced that as well. There have also been complaints of inefficiency in collection procedures. Many of these complaints could be corrected by adequate training of staff and adequate numbers of staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us could spend a great deal of time giving anecdotal stories of the things that have come into our office. One in particular was bizarre. An arrangement which originally had been paid regularly through the collector of maintenance&mdash;an amount paid by the former husband in excess of the court order&mdash;eventually was registered with the Child Support Agency. The Agency found that there was a credit of $1,500; that was the amount extra that the husband had been paying, had agreed to pay, had always paid, and was happy to continue to pay. The Agency told the husband that there was a credit and he did not have to pay any more for a while. He continued to pay what he had always paid because that was the agreement between him and his wife, notwithstanding a court order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This saga goes on and on, but I shall not detail it all. Every now and again the Agency would not send her a monthly payment because, even though it had the money, it said that her payments were in credit of the court order. Phone calls were made to the Agency. The responses were: `We are working on a skeleton staff'; `Sorry, she's at lunch'; `He's sick'; `He's not on the floor today'. It just went on and on. The money was in the hands of the Agency, that is the point. It was not arrears being collected. It had been paid by the husband for the benefit of his children, but the Agency would not pass it on because it appeared to be in excess of the order. In fact, the Agency had been told very clearly that it was the amount the parents had agreed upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has to be some scope for flexibility if this scheme is to work. Where people reach an agreement&mdash;for example, in this instance, to pay more&mdash;or where the father agrees to continue to pay for a child continuing on to tertiary education, the Agency should acknowledge this and not interfere to this extent. The stress caused to the people concerned, of course, is enormous. It is not a matter of any individual officer not doing his or her duty or not trying. I believe these officers are overstressed. One girl we spoke to said that she had been on the job for two days. She had inherited 200 letters, some of which were several months old. In those two days she had answered only six letters because of the number of phone calls coming in. That is the sort of pressure those in the Agency are working under. I should say that they are working under great stress. So there is stress within the Agency and enormous frustration in the community with those who are trying to deal with it and trying to get on with their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think in what I have said this afternoon I have indicated the things that still need to be done to make the scheme work properly. I shall not go into the need for this scheme and the background to it. As I said at the beginning, it is working fairly well when we consider the amount of money that is being collected and the significantly larger numbers of children whose parents are now contributing to their support, as they should be. Let us try to run it in a way that gets rid of the frustrations that are causing so much trouble to so many people and make sure that it operates in the way that the Parliament wanted it to when it set out on this exercise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy today to support the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 and the amendments to it proposed in the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill. I take note of what Senator Reid said in her contribution. Much of it would not be a matter of disagreement amongst us. But, listening to Senator Reid, one might have concluded that something more significant than just administrative procedures needed to be changed. To make it quite clear, I think Senator Reid would be in support of the basic understanding of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The criticisms of this Bill, while they are extensive, I do not think in any way jeopardise the intent of the original legislation nor suggest significant amendment to it. However, some of those administrative difficulties have led to the amendment we have here today: that is, the introduction of a new administrative appeals system so that people will not have to go back through the Family Court if they want to modify, increase or reduce the child support payments that are in place for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know the difficulties of getting in and out of the Family Court, particularly in relation to delays and the challenge alluded to by Senator Reid in respect of legal costs. These are the sorts of things that make most people decide it is not worth proceeding. This amendment allowing for a simpler, less expensive and more accessible appeals procedure to modify arrangements made under child support agreements deserves our commendation and has to have the support of everybody in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is reasonable, while we are talking to this amendment, to canvass a few other issues associated with child support. It is true that it has been an area of significant complaints. Those complaints have come to most honourable senators, I should have thought, in all sorts of ways and they have their own character and colour. But I note that the character of the complaints I get about child support and the payment of maintenance has changed over the past five years. It has moved away from `I can hardly cope with the insufficiency of the payment' and `I don't get much' to `Why do I have to pay all of that?'. In other words, the complaints in large number come more from the paying non-custodial parent than from the non-receiving custodial parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is one statistic that should be held up in this legislation it is the collection rate; that is, the payment of maintenance before and after the introduction of this legislation. Before the legislation, about 30 per cent of non-custodial parents contributed maintenance payments on behalf of their children. Since the introduction of this legislation, the figure has increased to about 70 per cent. That is a very significant statistic. People were avoiding their responsibilities and liabilities under the law as a consequence of producing and parenting children, through adoption or whatever. After the introduction of this legislation, there was a dramatic increase in the number of parents who appreciated that they had better accept that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is also shocking is that 30 per cent of non-custodial parents are still avoiding the payment. If we say that an increase from 30 per cent to 70 per cent is worth noting, and I think it is, it is also important to remember that that still leaves 30 per cent of non-custodial parents who are avoiding their obligations. By and large, they are not avoiding them because of administrative difficulties with the Child Support Agency. They are avoiding them because they do not want to pay. They are avoiding them because they say, `We should not pay unless we have access to children'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most common confusions in the minds of people, certainly in the minds of non-custodial parents, is that if they pay maintenance they have a right to access. It is important to note that those are two quite separate issues. Paying maintenance is an obligation consequent upon having a child and it in no way buys access. Being denied access in no way reduces or removes an obligation for maintenance. As people begin to appreciate that, having had a child, they have an obligation to provide for its livelihood, its education, its housing, food, clothing and so on, we see a gradual acceptance and an appreciation of that obligation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said before in this place, one of the things that has quite shocked me is the number of non-custodial parents, very often men, who paid their maintenance obligations before this legislation was introduced and who still felt annoyed at having to do it. I used to be surprised and ask them why, if they were honourably fulfilling their obligations, they did they not join forces with those people who felt that that was an honourable thing to do and loudly go out and ask not that non-custodial parents should in some way be frowned upon but that non-paying non-custodial parents should be frowned on. If they have actually fulfilled their obligations without legislative requirement to do so, they should be proud of themselves and should be aware that that is honourable behaviour and should encourage it amongst non-paying non-custodial parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is still anger out there. I might say that some of that anger gets to the Child Support Agency. One of the assessments I was able to participate in was in relation to the Tax Office talking about the changes required for public servants dealing with the Child Support Agency. They reported that this was not the usual area of operation for people in the tax area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surprisingly, what was reported was the amount of anger shown by parents raising difficulties about the Child Support Agency. I am a bit surprised about that because I would have thought that one area of the Public Service that certainly engendered anger in the community was the Tax Office. I am a bit surprised that parents only got angry when they were told they had to pay maintenance. I have never known anybody to speak kindly of a tax officer. It is interesting to note that the tax officers themselves say that the level of anger in people who are involved with child support payments was qualitatively and quantitatively different from what they had experienced before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To pick up on a point that Senator Reid made, adequate in-service training has to be made available for people who have to deal with this amount of feeling. It is not whether the payment is $36 or $38 which enrages people; it is all those other bits of undefined areas about having to pay it, asking why they should pay it and why the new boyfriend's income is not taken into account, and so on. All of that is non-specific and very difficult to deal with but it is a matter of needing counselling skills to help people face up to this anger and deal with it constructively. There are too many examples of inappropriate behaviour as a consequence of anger. As much as possible, the Child Support Agency appreciates and recognises the areas of difficulty and deals with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the problems are administrative. I do not need to canvass again the points that were raised by Senator Reid. There is a lot of legitimacy in all of those points that she raised. I am not in any way ascribing insufficiency to Senator Reid, as may have been understood. Those points are certainly complaints that she and others of us have received. We need to question the number and size of those complaints. The passion with which complaints in this area are raised can often make one feel it is a major problem when, in fact, it is a major problem but in small numbers. We need to have that qualifying rider in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is terribly important to stress the adequacy of training and support for staff who have to deal with people in this area, particularly when anger is still around or when anger recurs. This very often happens when the custodial spouse enters into a new relationship and that further income is not taken into account by way of, perhaps, reducing the maintenance obligations of the non-custodial parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We faced a difficulty in this place when we were trying to help outline the areas of design for this legislation&mdash;I note that my colleague Senator Coates is here and I certainly acknowledge his contribution to the original design of this Bill. We had to appreciate that quite often the second spouse&mdash;the new husband, let us say, in shorthand, although it need not necessarily be a second husband&mdash;may have maintenance obligations to a previous family of his own. We could not anticipate all of the possible variations and arrangements that we would have to deal with. I am quite surprised at how successful this legislation has been in terms of taking into account the complexities of the financial arrangements of people in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also interested to see that we are now looking at those people who are asset rich and income poor and, therefore, able to avoid some of their maintenance obligations. I think it is important that we proceed gently&mdash;as this whole area of administration has proceeded&mdash;to tackle the issue of non-payment of maintenance. It is a matter of equity. It is a matter of assisting the Government to give the proper message to the community that if people have children they are charged with an obligation. It is not the nature of this Government, and certainly not the sentiment of this Government, that once people have children it does not matter that they do not care for them because they can be picked up through the social security system. It is important&mdash;and it is one of the areas where we have bipartisan support&mdash;that parents have an obligation to their children for their care and upbringing. That is one of the themes of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this legislation was introduced I said that the Government needed to be particularly congratulated for having the political will to implement and carry this legislation through to the stage of it becoming an Act, and setting those obligations on the community in line with the sentiments of the Government. In no way do we assist parents to abdicate their responsibilities for their children, although sometimes loose language from the Opposition suggests that we do. This legislation is exactly counter to those claims and it gives effect to a very powerfully held sentiment of the Government that we are in support of families in their business of looking after their children. This legislation provides backup support and guidance and, in this case, gives a clear outline of what we understand parents and families say are their obligations. We are not intruding between parents and children. Indeed, through this legislation we are assisting in re-establishing that contact between parent and child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this Bill is consistent with the Government's intention to assist children, and aim to have no children living in poverty. Again, we could spend all night talking about the definition of `poverty'. It is also clear that we do understand that in providing sufficient money, just plain income, for families we can also assist those children to minimise poverty. As I said previously, income alone is not the only thing that is required to address moving out of poverty. We need adequate health care. We need access to education. We need parents who are confident and able to provide guidance&mdash;to shelter and lead&mdash;as their children grow to adulthood. Not all of that can be provided with income to families. In no way do we wish to undercut the income but, as well as income, other parts of this Government's policy very much address the provision of care and minimising of poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to note that we do have a social security system that is in tandem with the maintenance payments, not in opposition to them and certainly not trying to replace them&mdash;not any more. That is something that the Government should stand applauded for as well. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, when looking at these families that are struggling to care for their children&mdash;very often with one parent and a modest income&mdash;one of the things we can note as a benefit of the establishment of this Agency is regular and consistent income. That is certainly what a lot of custodial parents have said, `At least I now know that that amount of money will be that amount and it will be provided regularly'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take note of what Senator Reid has said about those examples of where there have been delays. On the whole, of those parents who are now receiving payment through the Child Support Agency there is, in large part, that regular and reliable known income coming in. Most of these people are not living at the top end of the income scale. Many supporting parents and single parents with children are on modest to very meagre incomes. They have been, as defined in many places, the poorest people in our society. They are the people who struggle against the largest odds. It is important that we acknowledge the achievements of the Child Support Agency so far in addressing those questions of poverty and income maintenance and, at the same time, urging people to appreciate their responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a matter of interest for me that the Opposition, while it may support this policy here, in its Fightback package proposes to put a 15 per cent goods and services tax on all those things that people on low incomes, in particular, have to buy&mdash;food and clothing for their children. That 15 per cent tax will bite those families on low fixed or modestly increasing incomes who are least able to cope with it and for whom there will be the least amount of compensation. The Opposition's proposal of a 15 per cent tax on food and clothing for people whose income, for the large part, goes towards buying food and clothing will create terrible contrary messages to people who may see the Opposition as supporting the Child Support Agency and the legislation to assist with maintenance payments. The two run in direct conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition senators get up in this place and say that they care passionately about children and want to see people assisted out of poverty. They slate the Government for aiming to remove children from poverty but plan to introduce a 15 per cent tax on food and clothing for people particularly struggling at this end of the market. Opposition senators should not dare stand up and tell us about inconsistencies; they should look to their own. They are dramatic inconsistencies and they are highlighted for people who are on restricted incomes or who are enjoying maintenance through the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments that have come into the Senate will assist those people who already enjoy the benefits of the Child Support Agency through the regular and reliable income it provides. They will also allow them more readily to change the terms of those agreements if and when they need to be changed. Of course, we know that from time to time we need or desire to change the agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendments, in terms of being able to access assets to assist in the responsibilities of maintenance, are of benefit. I also believe that the points going not so much to matters of legislation but administration under this legislation are certainly enjoying ongoing review. I believe that we may iron out the hiccups and that the legislation to this point with this further amendment certainly achieves its principal aim. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also welcome the opportunity to speak on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1992, which makes a number of changes to the existing child support legislation. Generally speaking, the Australian Democrats welcome these changes which should improve the collection of child support payments. It is clear that the support scheme is, at heart, effective; it is a sound scheme that has had good results; in other words, it has assisted with the payment of moneys that have enabled children to live a better standard of life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988, only 34 per cent of all custodial parents were receiving maintenance. By 1991, this figure had risen to 45 per cent. Indeed, for the stage 2 parents, the figure had risen to 56 per cent. Alongside this, the scheme has also brought with it a gradual change in community attitudes. I wish to quote from a recent report by a group chaired by Mr Justice Fogarty. It is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Child Support in Australia&mdash;Final Report of the Evaluation of the Child Support Scheme</EMPHASIS>. On page 5 of Volume 1&mdash;the main report&mdash;the Advisory Group concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Scheme has challenged strongly the pre-Scheme ethos of maintenance payments being a voluntary act. The community now expects that all parents will contribute to the support of their own children and they are now more likely to make arrangements for the payment of maintenance.</PARA>
<PARA>For that alone it has been extremely valuable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I proceed to look precisely at what is in this Bill, I want to discuss two major areas of concern. Firstly, there are continuing problems in the operation and administration of the Child Support Agency, which will undermine these positive changes unless the Government gets serious about providing adequate resources to the Agency. It is worth making this point from the outset, because it is possibly the biggest obstacle in the ongoing success of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one thing for the Government to establish a collection program such as this and then to boast, quite rightly, about the amount of money that it is saving the taxpayer, but it is surely essential that the Government then properly fund the Agency concerned so that it can provide good standard, high quality service to its clients. By `clients', I mean both custodial and non-custodial parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that many honourable senators, or their staff, are trying to follow up on child support matters on behalf of their constituents. In doing so, they may sit for many minutes at the end of a telephone&mdash;frequently a ridiculous amount of time&mdash;waiting to get through to the Child Support Agency. Certainly for our office this seems to be one of the major continuing sources of dissatisfaction from parents and, I must add, from workers who are trying to deal with the Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, I met with several community based child support workers in Melbourne. They told me that their workloads have increased as more and more people have contacted them because they either could not get through to the Agency or, if they did finally get through, the resources of the Agency were such that they were not able to receive the required support and they were not able to get satisfactory advice from the Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Child Support Evaluation Advisory Group has commented that it is frequently impossible for clients to contact the Agency by telephone. Submissions received by the Advisory Group indicate that this problem is a common one, resulting in frustration and resentment towards both the Agency and the poor unfortunate staff in the scheme who are trying to deal with all this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems obvious that the Agency simply does not have the resources to cope with what is an extremely high workload. Indeed, the Agency itself has admitted that its basic problem is that there are not enough staff to answer the 12,000 telephone inquiries a month. We have probably also heard complaints of errors made by the Agency and reports of unacceptable delays in written responses from it, in the registration process and the wait between the Agency's receiving maintenance payments and the forwarding of them to the custodial parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the evaluation of the scheme by the Institute of Family Studies that was published in August last year, only 55 per cent of the registered custodial parents surveyed reported receiving support payments following their entry into the scheme. The Child Support Evaluation Advisory Group reported that this delay had probably done more harm to the reputation of the scheme than any other factor. It went on to say that it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . believes it is essential to the future success of the Scheme that this problem be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA>The Advisory Group recommended a sensible solution to the problem which would involve the Government making an advance payment to the custodial parent during this delay period and offsetting that payment against the final payment made by the liable parent. I certainly hope that the Government takes up this recommendation when the next Bill dealing with this area is before us, which I understand will be later this session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are already major problems with the Agency's enforcement process. The issue of enforcement is clearly linked to the confidence that people have in the scheme and their willingness to use it. The Advisory Group says that `enforcement activity by the Agency has been very disappointing', pointing out that only 57 per cent of stage 1 and 2 periodic liabilities are paid on time. It is difficult to generate confidence in the scheme when the Agency is not efficient or prompt in enforcing payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In situations where non-custodial parents are deliberately avoiding their obligations, the Agency needs sufficient resources to chase them up. We have had evidence that people will go to extraordinary lengths to avoid their obligations. People move frequently and change jobs. They try to hide their whereabouts and disguise their incomes. The Agency must have sufficient resources to tackle this problem. At present, it certainly does not appear to be the case that the Agency has anything like the resources it requires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report, the Advisory Group points out not only that vigorous tracing is an essential prerequisite to the successful collection of maintenance liabilities, but also that unless numbers being traced are kept to a minimum, the scheme could be undermined. The Advisory Group sees a pressing need to improve the Agency's overall collection rate, which is presently running at about 65 per cent&mdash;it is some 70 per cent for stage 1 and 50 per cent for stage 2&mdash;falling well short of the Agency's own target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem is that access to the Agency is especially difficult for country people. There are few places in rural areas where people can obtain correct advice about the child support scheme. Their only option is the Agency's 008 number and there, unfortunately, the wait can be considerably longer than for a local call. Indeed, waits of up to 30 minutes are frequent. From the complaints I have had from country people about the Agency, it seems that there is a pressing need for either more community based child support workers in rural areas or for the agency to place specialist workers in the regional offices of government departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish with these criticisms to cast any aspersions on current Agency staff. It is quite clearly a lack of resources that is creating a major impediment to the Agency's carrying out its job properly. It is high time that the Government moved to fix the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I believe that a major problem lies with the two-tiered scheme&mdash;the fact that the scheme will be implemented in two stages. The Government has continued to refuse to extend the operation of the scheme to all children in need. Support for widening the eligibility provisions of the scheme to include all children has now come from the advisory group, the Family Law Council, the Institute of Family Studies and the vast majority of community groups and legal organisations working in this field. Indeed, Justice Fogarty, in his letter presenting the report, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1990, the Advisory group advised the Government that the division of the children of Australia between Stage One and Stage Two by an arbitrary time line was unfair to the children excluded from Stage Two.</PARA>
<PARA>He recommended that all children have the opportunity to use stage 2. It is a matter of regret that nothing has been done by the Government on this matter. That means that a substantial number of children in Australia continue to be significantly disadvantaged and many will continue to live in poverty. The Government's continuing failure to act in this matter is a disgrace. I will be interested to hear the Minister's reasons at the conclusion of the debate tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These two areas&mdash;the failure to widen the scheme and its ongoing serious administrative and operational difficulties due to lack of funds&mdash;sometimes make it difficult to get the true value of the scheme in perspective. However, it is clear that the scheme has proved cost-effective and it has certainly moved a considerable way towards ensuring non-custodial parents actually meet their obligations. Of course, it is sometimes rather difficult to get an accurate picture of the nature of the problem because the views of custodial and non-custodial parents differ so markedly. For example, the Institute of Family Studies report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non-custodial parents were generally negative about the operation of the scheme . . . They also had a limited understanding of the collection procedures.</PARA>
<PARA>The report also observed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps the most worrying polarisation between custodial and non-custodial parents occurs in their perceptions of the relationship between non-custodial parents and their children, and the effect of the Child Support Agency registration on this relationship.</PARA>
<PARA>This polarisation and the negative attitudes of non-custodial parents can make it rather difficult to get an accurate picture of how the scheme is working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, of course, a highly emotionally charged area and allegations will continue to fly thick and fast. But we should not let highly emotive anecdotal material hide the fact that because of the child support scheme considerably more children are now being supported than was previously the case. Yes, there are problems&mdash;let us face it, there will probably always be some who have considerable difficulty facing the fact that payments must be made. I think that is due to the very traumatic nature of family breakdown. Generally speaking, I believe that most of the problems are being addressed and gradually, as they are examined, being dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill certainly remedies a few outstanding problems, one of which has been that people previously had to go through the formal court process to change their assessments. The cost of this was carried by the person initiating proceedings. It could become a very costly process indeed. With this Bill, the Government is setting up an administrative review process which will enable people to have an assessment of child support reviewed by a child support review officer engaged by the Registrar. The review officer will technically be independent from the Agency and the conduct of the review will not require legal representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grounds for departure from an assessment will be the same as are currently available to the court under section 117 of the Child Support Assessment Act. I know that some concerns have been expressed about section 117 and there have been suggestions that it should be widened. I believe that there is possibly a need for some extension to look at the reasonable costs of access and a number of other issues. However, I note that the Advisory Group considered that section 117 grounds had worked well, had been consistently interpreted by the courts and had maintained a satisfactory balance between the various competing interests of the custodial and non-custodial parents. The Democrats certainly support a less formal and less expensive process, but we would have preferred to have seen a tribunal process, similar to that available to social security recipients. The Democrats do not intend to move amendments at this stage to hold up in any way this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some concerns about the review officers. Some child-care workers have expressed to me the need for them to be seen as totally independent. The suggestion has been made that hearings should be conducted on premises other than those of the Child Support Agency. It is most unfortunate, but certainly true, that some people see the agency as being biased. The review process needs to be clearly seen to be fair and independent. I believe that one of the ways of doing this is to make sure that these reviews are held on neutral territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also makes a number of changes to the Registrar's capacity to recover child support debts. The Registrar will now be able to seek a court order setting aside a transaction which is intended to reduce or eliminate altogether a person's capacity to pay child support. The Registrar will also have the power to recover a child support debt from a third party, where the money is actually being held on behalf of the person who is liable for the debt, and to recover money from a liable parent who is not present in Australia. Both of these measures should enable the Registrar to act more promptly to recover child support debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another provision in the Bill concerns payments made outside the Agency arrangements. At present, the Registrar can take into account payments made directly between the parties and offset them against a liability to pay the Registrar. This is a useful provision and one which is often used by parents, often in emergencies or special situations when they suddenly need some extra funds. The Bill expands the range of payments that the Registrar can take into account, including money paid to third parties. All of these moves are supported by the Australian Democrats. There are a number of other measures in this Bill which I will not go through specifically&mdash;we do not have any problems with them and we believe they will generally enhance the operation of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, I do not believe that there is anything inherently wrong with the child support scheme. It certainly needs some finetuning. I look forward to the next piece of legislation which will deal in more detail with the report from the Child Support Evaluation Advisory Group. I certainly hope that the Government does not let the report gather dust on a shelf somewhere and that it implements the suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say just a word about the formula. I think it is generally acknowledged that there have been some problems with the formula, especially as it relates to second families. The Advisory Group goes into this issue in considerable detail before finally recommending an amendment to the formula along the lines suggested by Justice Kay of the Family Court. I think the Government would do well to look at Justice Kay's suggestions. I look forward to the Minister's comments later tonight on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I ask the Minister whether he will be giving consideration to the recommendation made by the Advisory Group that an independent person or body be appointed to review the performance of the scheme about 12 months after the completion of this report and advise the Minister for Social Security of the outcome. The child support scheme and the Agency charged with administering it deserve more from the Government, as do the children of Australia who are affected by this scheme. In conclusion, while supporting this Bill, I strongly urge the Government to provide the Child Support Agency with the additional resources it so urgently requires and to widen the scheme to make sure that all children are adequately dealt with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The child support scheme was introduced in 1988 as a legislative response to a very large community problem which has not gone away. As we all know, since 1976 the divorce rate has remained at considerably high levels. Over that period, the number of divorces granted each year has fluctuated between 40,000 and 50,000, which is a great number. We have had around 700,000 divorces since the rule changed in 1976. We now have a situation where one in three first marriages ends in divorce and one in two second marriages fails as well. Of those divorces, nearly 60 per cent involve children. Since the Family Court started, a total of 750,182 children have been involved in the divorce process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The potential for problems with such issues as custody, access, property and maintenance is enormous. History shows us that despite the ideals of the 1976 legislation, there are still many areas of dispute. Another figure of quite grave significance is that some 20 per cent of children now born in Australia are born either in de facto relationships or outside of marriage. Not surprisingly, most of the problems involve children. For a variety of reasons, non-custodial parents frequently do not pay maintenance for their children. The notion that each parent ought to be equally emotionally and financially responsible for the children is fine in theory but falls apart in the divorce process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a host of reasons, non-custodial parents resent paying money to ex-spouses. Notwithstanding the fact that the parents have had disagreements&mdash;this being the reason for their actual break-up&mdash;often their resentment is related to their inability to see their children as frequently as they want to. One of the reasons I first pushed for the establishment of the inquiry into the Family Law Act was that people were complaining and concerned about the fact that they could not get easy and equal access to their children. Often&mdash;and this is becoming a big issue&mdash;maintenance is not paid because a lot of those people have remarried. They have a second family and cannot afford to pay the amount of maintenance prescribed by the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that background, however, was the increasing burden being placed on the Australian taxpayer. Increasing numbers of sole parents were turning to the taxpayer for funds with the non-custodial parent opting out of the entire process. It was obvious that something had to be done and, accordingly, the child support scheme was brought into being. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But with that scheme has come a number of problems. I note that the final report on the evaluation of the scheme also acknowledges that major difficulties are being encountered. The report refers to the intent of the scheme&mdash;that is, to ensure a collection rate as close as possible to 100 per cent. My understanding is that the Child Support Agency collects and distributes over $11m every month, but this represents only 65 per cent of the total payments made. The Child Support Evaluation Advisory Group suggests that the collection rate should and can be higher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report states that a number of submissions were received from non-custodial parents claiming that the formula was not fair to them&mdash;and that has been my experience in the last few years. A lot of non-custodial parents are concerned and worried that even when they have custody of their children&mdash;for example, for a weekend, a couple of days, a week or a holiday period&mdash;they still have to pay maintenance to the custodial spouse. The Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act has received numerous submissions on that very point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other complaints about the system include the very low level of auto-withholding or direct debit from personal accounts to the Agency; the eight-week delay between registration and first payment; and the very low level of enforcement through the courts. In other words, to date many&mdash;indeed, hundreds&mdash;of custodial parents have had little joy in pursuing what the court has determined is their actual due. As I said earlier, my electoral office is probably no different from others in terms of the number of complaints it receives about non-payment of maintenance. I am quite sure that other members of the Senate sitting here tonight would get the same complaints and the same concerns from people in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system is cumbersome, it is clumsy and I believe that it is basically flawed. In an effort to iron out these flaws, the advisory group has brought down a quite extensive report on the findings of a survey and its conclusions. I do not intend to canvass all its recommendations, but there are a couple of issues that I would like to raise. The report is pretty big and quite detailed. Some extensive work has been done in looking at the child support scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advisory group was asked to consider a before-tax versus an after-tax liability assessment. The group's decision to adhere to the before-tax formula was done on the basis that the unfairness allegation about the formula was illusory and that, even if it was applied after tax, a similar dollar result would be arrived at. But I have reservations about that and I remain to be convinced. There was considerable argument about whether a standard formula should be used, and again I remain to be convinced whether it is best to have a formula. There are problems no matter which way liability is assessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill does not address any of these difficulties. However, it does attempt to overcome the problem of non-payment of maintenance by suggesting that the Agency access and remove funds from banks and other places if the non-custodial parent will not pay the outstanding debts. I just do not quite know how that is going to work. In reality, basically I do not think it will work because, if one has no intention of paying, one will simply transfer one's cash reserves elsewhere. In the case of a remarried non-custodian, I would think that a transfer into the new spouse's name would overcome the ability of any government agency to access that money. Perhaps at the committee stage that will be explained by the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), who is at the table, and his advisers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But one really has to question the civil liberties aspects of this move. The Opposition has moved an amendment to ensure that this becomes a last resort measure. I believe that should be the case because people do have responsibilities; and if they do not meet them, they should be chased up. But how that is to happen will have to be explained later at the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the notion. But I come back to my original assertion that the issue will still be basically unresolved even after this legislation, in whatever form, finally passes this chamber. When calling for the establishment of an inquiry into family law, I was keen to include child support issues in its terms of reference. However, I do not know whether it is correct to say that I was persuaded not to do so. I was told that obviously child support is a Treasury matter, that it had nothing to do with the Attorney-General's Department and, therefore, an inquiry into the Family Law Act should pertain to that Act. In other words, matters relating to the Child Support Agency should be dealt with by way of amendments and by the inquiry that I have just mentioned. I can understand the wisdom of the people who talked me out of including the Child Support Agency in the Committee's terms of reference but I am still concerned because I do not think it is working as well as it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyway, I deferred to wiser legal council and deleted it on the grounds that child support was not a function of the Family Law Act. But gee whiz, if it is not a part of it, it is pretty close to it because there is a very big connection between the Family Law Act, the Treasury and the Attorney-General. Given the number of submissions the Committee has received that involve child support complaints, I definitely did the wrong thing by not keeping it within the terms of reference and having it as a second part of the inquiry. We ought to have examined the issue of child support, notwithstanding this Advisory Group's existence. I still believe that it is something that the family law inquiry will have to think about solidly when we finally come to our recommendations of what does happen to the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Going back to the Child Support Evaluation Advisory Group's recommendations, it has presented a lengthy two-volume report to the Parliament, but I ask other senators: where does that report go from here? Will the recommendations in that report ultimately see the light of day in legislative changes? Who will press the Government into following some of the recommendations that are being made? When Senator McMullan, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer in this place, spoke about the increase in the amount of money, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence indicated that between 1973-74 and 1985-86 sole parents had risen from 9 per cent of the population to 15 per cent and the number reliant on social security entitlements rose from 65 per cent to 85 per cent. Social security payments in the same period rose from $160m to $1.7m, and continued to rise to $2.334m. The Government firmly believes that these statistics provided no alternative other than to introduce widespread reforms.</PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ever increasing number of sole parent families, their apparent increasing poverty and the resultant growth in Government social welfare expenditure calls for a reassessment of public and private roles in providing support for families.</PARA>
<PARA>I have said before that the question of child support is difficult; it is costing a lot of money. Maybe we really should be thinking about why so many people are getting divorced and why so many people need child support. Maybe we should be going right back and finding out exactly what are the causes of a lot of the problems as far as marriage is concerned. Then we might not have so many problems with the Child Support Agency; we might not have so many people needing child support because people would stick together more than they have in the last little while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, there is no easy solution. To date, we have found too few answers to questions that seem to be too far away from being answered. I think we need to do more because with over three-quarters of a million children with divorced parents the problems are growing, as is the welfare budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This Bill is designed to introduce more flexible appeal mechanisms and collection arrangements. I hope it will achieve a little, but I doubt it. It will enhance the powers of the Registrar of Child Support to recover outstanding amounts. I have already said that I do not know whether it will achieve that. It will extend the scheme eligibility in respect of children subject to the child welfare laws.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Senate will be aware&mdash;and I am sure all members and senators will be aware&mdash;this legislation, or the principal Act, has had a profound impact upon the domestic relationships of many families in Australia. By and large, most people who have been affected by it would say that, in principle, it is sound; that it was undesirable, from a community point of view&mdash;and particularly from the point of view of the children concerned&mdash;that we had a situation where something like 70 per cent of parents were not honouring their obligations. Indeed, the system did encourage people to bypass the formal requirements of maintenance and to simply approach the Department of Social Security for payment of sole parent pensions rather than expecting non-custodial parents to shoulder their portion of the responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the concept behind the Child Support Act has been a major step forward, and one that we would welcome. However, in recent times it has become clear that the system does not provide the flexibility that it should. Indeed, some of the structures upon which it is based are in urgent need of reconsideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether others have mentioned the strict application of the formula, but on a trip I took to Mount Isa last week I was reminded in no uncertain terms of some of the extraordinary situations that can arise. For example, at the time of separation a father might be earning a modest wage&mdash;let us say, about average weekly earnings&mdash;he then separates, and has to pay, according to the formula, 27 per cent for two children. The wife is quite content with that amount; it represents a sufficient contribution, as far as she is concerned, to the welfare of the children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then goes to a place like Mount Isa where he finds himself working long, hard hours underground; at the same time he is earning about $60,000 or even $80,000 a year. Suddenly and automatically, there is a great windfall by way of additional payments extracted. From the representations made to me by various organisations, particularly Dads Against Discrimination (DADs), it seems clear that this really is another unintended consequence. They say to me that they can cite a number of instances where even the custodial parents have said that this is much more than they expect&mdash;in fact, more than they need&mdash;and they regard the system as inflexible in that in most instances it imposes very severe disincentives on fathers to actually get out and start a new life for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the underlying principle&mdash;that only the equivalent of unemployment benefits is set aside for the purpose of maintaining the non-custodial parent before the formula is applied&mdash;does seem to provide a massive disincentive. I think it is fair to say that we ought to have another very hard and long look at the way in which the Child Support Agency and scheme have been operating in the past few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is designed to introduce more flexible appeal mechanisms and collection arrangements to enhance the powers of the Registrar of Child Support to recover outstanding amounts, and it does extend some scheme flexibility in respect of children subject to child welfare laws. However, I have to say that it really only makes a very modest contribution to the sorts of reforms which seem to be very much needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent report of the Advisory Committee headed by Mr Justice Fogarty represents progress, but it does take for granted a number of these very contentious premises upon which the scheme is based and which have been a continuing source of concern to many of my colleagues. I dare say that honourable senators on the other side of the chamber would have received the same level of representations. What one finds is that whereas once immigration and welfare matters were always the bread and butter in terms of constituency representations, now it is quite common to find that child support representations outnumber the others. I know from discussions with these groups&mdash;indeed, I know from what they have told me about discussions that they have had with Senator McMullan&mdash;that there are a number of ways in which the system does bear revisiting, and some of these inflexibilities should be given further careful consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, no-one wants to absolve people from their responsibilities. My impression of the members of DADs groups that I met, in places such as Adelaide, Perth and Mount Isa, was that they were very much committed to the concept of maintenance. They acknowledged their responsibilities. They were in no way wanting to be critical of the opposite sex. They were simply saying that the system had to be fair to all parties and that, in a number of instances, they believed that it simply imposed too great a financial burden upon one side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to be as objective as possible in these matters but, certainly, a number of case studies which they put before me indicate that there are grounds for concern and one ought to be prepared to reconsider the matter. It may well be that either we need some further parliamentary scrutiny of the process or the Government itself ought to be taking the initiative&mdash;in part, I suppose, based on the reports of Mr Justice Fogarty's Committee, but also it ought to take account of many of the direct representations which a number of us have received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an Opposition, we support the initiatives proposed in this Bill. Modest as they are, at least they acknowledge a number of the problems that currently exist. Perhaps the major one is allowing a custodian or a liable parent to have an assessment of child support reviewed by an independent person free of charge and without legal representation by a child support review officer employed by the Registrar for that single purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the review may be based only on grounds that are presently set out for appeals&mdash;and these are quite narrow and technical&mdash;it is nonetheless a step forward. It is just nonsense to ignore the financial consequences that flow from putting oneself in the hands of lawyers and finding that one does not get any money back. There are all sorts of incentives that take over and which quite often do not lead to the speedy resolution of matters. That can operate as a very significant deterrent for those of modest means. It only takes a few cases where people are effectively wiped out financially in the course of achieving a modest legal gain for such people to be discouraged from using the system at all. In many instances that has been part of the grievances that have been put before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notion that one can vary the entitlement only if it is more than 15 per cent away from the previous year's gross income again displays inflexibility. There ought to be a much simpler method whereby people are able to establish to the satisfaction of the Registrar that their financial circumstances have changed to a lesser extent. In principle there is no reason why we should not be aspiring to accurately reflect the current financial circumstances of the parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure is there, presumably, as some sort of blunt instrument to say, `Well, we don't want to get bogged down with every minor change in financial circumstances, so we will weight it against the non-custodial party'. We do not do that to aged pensioners. We say to them, `If your financial circumstances change you have to notify the Department within 14 days'. That can be a source of great consternation to little old ladies and others, who say to me, `Will I go to gaol because I didn't tell the Department in time?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to insist in that instance on requiring a fairly precise adjustment as soon as there is even a modest departure from the level of income disclosed, then I do not see why it needs to be at more than a 15 per cent variance before any adjustment is possible. For the purposes of example I will talk in terms of those on higher incomes and it can be seen that 15 per cent on an income of $80,000 is something of the order of $12,000. We are talking about substantial sums of money and it does not strike me as being terribly equitable to simply apply those rules of thumb. Despite the fact that it does have those limitations, allowing people to have access to an administrative review without incurring legal costs is certainly a step forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other matters contained in the legislation. In regard to the private collection of maintenance the Bill will end the mandatory requirement, but will require custodial parents to report to the Department of Social Security that payments are being made in full. Again, that is probably a reflection of the fact that there needs to be flexibility in the system. Perhaps what I should have started off with when discussing the inefficiencies in this Act is something that I am reminded of when considering this proposition, because one of the major reasons why people would prefer private collection is that they do not have to be subjected to the inordinate and inexcusable delay that quite often flows from putting oneself in the hands of the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why it is that there needs to be delays of six to eight weeks or even longer has never been satisfactorily explained to me, other than for bureaucratic convenience. It seems to make a great deal of sense for people to work on monthly cycles and to require moneys to be paid only at a certain time and then paid out at another certain time. It is entirely supply driven and has nothing to do with the needs of the custodial parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my time in this place possibly the worst example I have come across occurred some years ago when a mother complained to me that just before Christmas she had put herself at the mercy of the Agency. She had been told that there would be a delay of four or five weeks. Therefore, she approached her estranged husband and said: `Will you come to the party? Will you help the kids get some toys for Christmas?' He handed over some money. She went to the Agency and said: `There you are. It can be done. I did not have to wait for four weeks.' The Agency's immediate response was that she had acted outside the terms of the Act and must repay the money immediately. The Agency then proceeded to rebuke the father into the bargain. I find that extraordinary. I know that the Government has received many representations on this matter, but has taken no action at all. As far as I am concerned, the Government is simply sitting on that money and drawing interest on it, which benefits the Government and greatly disadvantages the non-custodial parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the ultimate, there cannot be a satisfactory explanation. It is simply a matter of the Government not being prepared to advance that money on time out of its own coffers. It could be done quite simply; it is just that the bureaucrats dominate the system and will not allow that sort of flexibility to operate. It would be a very simple matter, once one has determined the entitlement of the custodial parent, to simply have the Government or the Agency pay that money out as it falls due, instead of this absolute nonsense of tying it to bureaucratic cycles and the time of payment made by the non-custodial parent. If there is one thing that needs to be tidied up urgently, it is that matter, and if my criticism can expedite the process, I will be very pleased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the other matters are really not sufficiently contentious to warrant analysis at this stage. I simply say that again they represent minor improvements only. They will not really lower the level of angst that we are all exposed to in this area. If the Government is fair dinkum about reform in this area, it will go a lot further than this Bill and will do it a lot faster than it has managed to date. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know from experience in my other areas of responsibility that when one deals with people's financial and tax arrangements one is dealing with a very sensitive area. We all know from our other experiences in dealing with matters of family law that it is an extremely sensitive area. When the two are put together, each problem is of great sensitivity and is beyond what would be a mere tax or a mere family law problem, because the two come together and reinforce each other as concerns to the citizens involved. That is perfectly reasonable and understandable and it is a matter that requires continuing sensitivity by members on all sides of this House and in the House of Representatives. Although I receive many representations from people, in the main they are within those parameters. They are people who are expressing concern on behalf of their constituents, but who are continuing to support the fundamentals of the scheme. I welcome that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As other speakers have said, the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill makes a number of changes to the original child support legislation. It has a number of features, but I will refer to only a few, and principally the introduction of the administrative review process and the enhancement of the powers of the Registrar to recover amounts that are due. Those are the two key elements. In summing up, I will not recount all those elements that were outlined in the second reading and which are otherwise outlined in the Bill. They are designed to enhance what the scheme has already achieved. It has achieved a significant turnaround in outcomes for children. It has achieved a significant improvement in the amount of income flowing to children&mdash;many of whom would otherwise be in great need&mdash;from the non-custodial parent. This has been achieved not at the expense of the taxpayers, but properly at the expense of the parent who should be paying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also engendered the beginning of a change in attitudes. There is an increasingly widespread acceptance of the appropriateness of the approach that parents should contribute to the upkeep of their children, whether they are together or separate. I welcome the fact that, as Senator Alston said&mdash;and it has also been my experience&mdash;the organisation which goes under the acronym DADs has made it clear when speaking to me that it is prepared to support only the people who recognise the basic premise that they have a responsibility to support their children. The organisation then argues about the detail and sometimes I disagree, but I welcome the fact that it operates from that principle. That is a principled position to take. I appreciate that it is much harder for that group to be objective about this than it is for me, and I welcome the fact that it is able to deal with it in that principled manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me respond to the first point made by Senator Alston before I go back through the comments made by other honourable senators as briefly as possible. I do not agree with his windfall example, because the principle is that the children's position in relation to the income of the parents should be substantially that which it would have been had there not been a separation. Had the parents been together and the father&mdash;as it is in this case&mdash;gone to Mount Isa and received a substantially enhanced income, the benefit&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we and other Australians contribute to our children is proportionate to our capacity to contribute. Those with higher incomes contribute more. That is why this is a percentage based scheme; it is why it should be a percentage based scheme; and it is why it will continue, for as long as we are involved, to be a percentage based scheme, including percentage of extra income earned. I understand that it is a source of anxiety for people, but I think that that is the correct principle and I intend, certainly for as long as I am involved, to support its continuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of emphasis on the inflexibility of the formula. There is one thing I want to say about that. By its very nature, a formula to have an administrative based resolution rather than requiring people to go to court, or resolving matters in the old ways, is a fixed arrangement in relation to a number of variables that are put into that fixed formula, and it produces an outcome. It is quite clear that the Government recognises, and has recognised since the inception of the scheme, that that can cause unfairness. Therefore, there are a number of mechanisms by which that can be varied&mdash;by private agreement and by the court. There will now be the capacity for it to be varied to take account of the special circumstances of the case by the new review officers. That is one of the advantages of the introduction of the new review officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not want a scheme that would apply hundreds of qualifications, make it exceedingly complex and probably do away with it as a formula based scheme; we would get back to case by case assessment of the merits without a need to review the formula. There are many cases&mdash;none of us hear about them because they are not the ones that people bring to our offices&mdash;where the formula applies satisfactorily, the money flows, children are better off and the level of anxiety between the parents is lower than it otherwise might have been. They are the ones that we do not hear about and they are helping thousands of children around Australia.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Reid raised that point as well as others. She went on to raise a number of matters. In the time that I want to take tonight I will not deal with all of them, but I will try to deal with the major ones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She raised the obvious question about the powers of the review officers. The Act is intended to establish that their powers in relation to an assessment will be the same as those of a court. In other words, if a review officer makes a decision, that will vary the formula in that case and the assessment will operate on the basis of the decision of the review officer. It would not obviate the right of an individual to go to court. The court case would not be an appeal against the review officer's decision. It would be&mdash;I think in the jargon that Senator Reid would know better than I&mdash;a de novo hearing. It would be as if the review process had not taken place. Obviously, it would only be triggered by dissatisfaction with the review officer's decision, although that would not be the formality of the matter before the court. We would hope that there would not be many of those. That is why the review officers are being introduced. Time will tell, but that is our hope and I think it is a reasonable expectation. I would think that this process would be more capable of resolving the sorts of matters that I see often. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Reid raised&mdash;and it was raised in the House of Representatives and has been raised with me by my colleagues&mdash;the administrative problems with the Child Support Agency. I am not going to pretend that they do not exist. They are primarily a product of the enormous volume of cases. Initially, there was a massive one-off surge and it was thought that the number of cases coming would slow dramatically. We now have to face the reality that it appears unlikely that it will ever slow in the manner originally envisaged. We are having to consider that and some of the administrative structures, and we are doing that in the light of the Fogarty recommendations. They are very helpful. We have not made our decision about them. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and I will be consulting with our colleagues in the Social Security and Attorney-General's portfolios to make final decisions on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is always difficulty in the area of enforcement procedures. People have an expectation that, because it is the Government taking the enforcement action on their behalf, we have the capacity to act in a manner that other people before courts do not. Of course, we have to go through the same process of getting orders, giving people time to appeal and all of those things that sometimes make court proceedings so lengthy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I did not hear this particular point, although I was trying to listen from my office to what Senator Reid said. I understand that she raised, and certainly others have raised, the concern that priority may be given to the largest cases. I have sought and received assurances that that is not the process. Priority is to be set by the date of the case, with one qualification, which I think is a sensible one and which I will mention in a moment. In essence, that is the priority setting, not the amount outstanding, which would be the more normal Australian Taxation Office procedure, and people can understand why that would be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The qualification is that there is some current thinking that if priority can be given to the small, very recently instituted bills it might lead to a situation where they do not escalate and those cases can more quickly and readily be brought into line. Therefore, the bigger enforcement charges will not arise. That is a new administrative arrangement that is being pursued. I think it is sensible, but it will have to be judged after some development of it. It is hoped that the new and enhanced powers of the Registrar to garnishee, as established by this Bill, will assist in the enforcement process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everybody expresses concern about the stress and pressure that is put on the staff of the Child Support Agency. That is true. They, individually, work remarkably well. I have been to all the Agency offices. I have met many of the staff. I have great admiration for them. That is not to say that they do not get things wrong because they do&mdash;they are humans dealing with hundreds and thousands of difficult cases&mdash;but they work very well and I give them my support. That does not mean we do not want to review the way that they work. I certainly do and we will use the Fogarty Report to look at some of the issues that have been raised. I support the individuals. I know that many members of the House of Representatives and the Senate have experienced great assistance from them as well as difficulties in some cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that the hard working staff would not be enhanced if we found policies being espoused which suggest that the efficiency dividend should be increased and the number of public servants being employed by governments should be cut. That is not the way to assist those staff or to assist the administration of this Child Support Agency. I think that would be a most unfortunate factor. We have to bear in mind, when people raise the issue, that perhaps there should be more staff. The last thing we need is the introduction of rigid increases in efficiency dividends that would, in fact, reduce the staff available to the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees raised two issues, both of which flow from the reviews. One is the question of widening the scheme to allow the formula to apply in all cases. The second is Justice Kay's proposal about second families. All I can say is that they are both under consideration. They are part of the considerations flowing from the Fogarty Report and the Government will be making a decision and an announcement about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Brownhill raised the continuing issue of whether this assessment should be based on before tax or after tax income. There are two fundamental issues to be addressed. The first is that whichever measure is used, it is the amount of money that is being targeted not the percentage. If we change to an after tax formula, we would have to increase the percentages to provide the level of income as assessed initially by the committee that developed the child support scheme and there would be no benefit to the non-custodial parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I understand the concerns they raised, we should point that out to them and the fact that it would increase the administrative complexity of the arrangement because, while taxable income is readily available, after-tax income would be a new calculation that would need to be made over and above those that are readily available. There is concern about how the garnishee scheme will work. Put simply in the time available, these powers already exist under the tax Act and they will operate here in the same way as they operate there. I will come back to deal with some elements of that in the committee stage. As I said, we are proposing here the same powers that apply in the tax Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other issues I could raise but I think that goes to the main questions raised by honourable senators in the debate.

In other words, it is not good enough simply to assume that those rights probably have been exhausted or to be indifferent about whether the time for appeal has expired.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal issue from the Government's point of view is that the power here is identical to the power contained in section 218 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. There is nothing new or novel about it. It will be exercised only within guidelines, as is the case with the sections under the Income Tax Assessment Act, and we do not need, and should not be making, special arrangements here. The guidelines are currently being drawn up and they will be followed in the exercise of this power. Given that the guidelines are not at this stage available, I understand that the Committee would want to be assured that they will be guidelines with which it is happy. I make it clear this evening, and will confirm tomorrow, that when those guidelines first become available I will make a copy available to Senator Alston and Senator Lees so that they can comment about the adequacy or otherwise of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> While I do not want to see this legislative restriction, for reasons I will comment on briefly in a moment, over and above saying that I do not see why we need a greater restriction in pursuing child support debt than tax debt because it may slow the flow of the money to the children, which is the intention of the scheme, I accept that the corollary of that is that the guidelines under which they operate must be satisfactory guidelines. I am quite happy to make those available to the representatives of the parties in the area concerned, who will make them effectively available to any honourable senator who wishes to obtain a copy. The problem is that the proposed amendment can delay the flow of money to the custodians for the benefit of the children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While in many instances it is clear that appeal processes need to be protected&mdash;and that is certainly right; no-one wants to interfere with the question of due process&mdash;to put it succinctly and without unduly taking the time of the Committee because, as I say, Senator Alston was succinct, the experience of the operation of a similar section under the Income Tax Assessment Act indicates that we do not need to provide greater protection here than we do there where the flow of money is not just the Government pursuing a debt to it but the Government, in this instance, pursuing a debt on behalf of the children of the non-custodial parent. I do not think we should be less diligent and empower the Taxation Office less, in this instance through the Child Support Registrar, to pursue these debts than we are in pursuing the normal tax debts to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will, through the guidelines, preserve the rights of individual men and women affected. To reassure people about the adequacy of the guidelines, I am happy to make them available for scrutiny by honourable senators and other interested people, but the key for the purpose of this debate is by honourable senators. I do not want to create a situation where we could, for example, pursue a debt by way of PAYE deduction from Australian wage and salary earners but cannot in the same circumstances pursue the same debt under the garnishee provisions because we are restricted by this amendment. It is substantially the same debt but because the employment circumstance of the individual is different the capacity to act is different. </PARA>

It is almost impossible to conceive a situation in which one could ultimately argue that the money was not owed to you because you had not done the work.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian automotive industry, particularly the luxury vehicle portion, must wonder what it has done to deserve what the Government has been handing out to it in recent years. The constant changing of the wholesale sales tax laws, combined with the Government's induced recession, has proved so detrimental to the automotive industry, one wonders whether it will ever get a chance to recover.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I probably do not need to remind my fellow senators of the copious tax laws and tax flaws which have been through this place since 1990. The whole mess began when Mr Keating, the then Treasurer, announced that the rate of sales tax payable on motor cars and station wagons, including four-wheel drive vehicles, with a wholesale value exceeding $28,793 was to increase from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. While the initial announcement created a surge in sales, the end result was a negative impact on government revenue. This was quite a rude shock for the Government, despite the Opposition's warning it that this would happen. As a result, the sales tax requirements were changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's second attempt at altering the sales tax on luxury cars was to amend the tax system so that it commenced at 30 per cent for vehicles priced at $30,234 and increased to a maximum of 50 per cent for vehicles with a wholesale price equal to or greater than $54,419. Subsequently, some 12 months later, the Government decided to review the higher rate luxury tax and reverted to the pre-May 1990 arrangements; that is, 30 per cent. In announcing the reversion to the previous regime, the Government conceded that since the introduction of the higher rate of luxury sales tax in May 1990, there had been a dramatic contraction in sales in that sector. Monthly sales are now running at less than a third of the level of the years before the tax changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's change of policy was too late; the serious consequences had already been felt by vehicle manufacturers and importers. In much the same way, the sales tax changes proposed today are too late. The thousands of Nissan workers and their families will tell us that. We never heard from the Government what the actual revenue figures for wholesale sales tax collected from luxury cars were during this period of confused wholesale sales tax rulings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sales Tax Amendment Bill before us today is primarily about reducing the wholesale sales tax from 20 per cent to 15 per cent for passenger vehicles that have a wholesale sale value of $30,505 or less. A secondary, but perhaps more important, issue that arises from this Bill is the impact of clause 4, which amends the second schedule by omitting the current wordy definition of `sales tax rate' and substituting `"sales tax rate" means 0.2 per cent'. This apparently simple definitional change has altered the formula used for calculating the luxury car tax threshold. The formula concerned has as one of its components, defined by the letter `C', the sales tax rate which applies to vehicles not affected by the 30 per cent sales tax limit. This was 20 per cent, or 0.2. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government had stuck with its original definition of the component, from 27 February 1991 the component should have been reduced to 15 per cent, or 0.15. However, the definitional change means that the component stays at 20 per cent, or 0.2. Therefore, under this legislation the sales tax retail threshold and the depreciation limit are no longer the same. For years the industry had been pushing for this nexus to be broken. The Government held out and said, `No, it is desirable to have a nexus'. But when it saw a revenue implication it chose to break it. It has chosen to break it in unfortunate circumstances which have given rise to a great deal of confusion in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We believe it is necessary to correct this situation by an amendment, which we will move in the committee stage. The Government's Bill creates an unnecessary anomaly in that it results in a retail price threshold for sales tax purposes of $43,936.76, yet retains the income tax depreciation limit of $45,462. The amendment that will be introduced by my colleague Senator Short seeks to overcome this problem by ensuring that the retail threshold price at which the tax rate increase is triggered would remain tied to the income tax depreciation limit. In achieving this, the amendment does no more than reinstate the policy adopted by the Government when it introduced the highly discriminatory luxury car tax in 1986. The Government is now proposing to abandon this policy without any sound reason or explanation, to the confusion and detriment of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Logic dictates that the luxury car tax threshold should not fall below the income tax depreciation limit. To do otherwise would mean, in practical terms, a reduction by stealth in the income tax depreciation limit as it now applies to new motor vehicles. I believe that this is just not good enough. It is poor legislation, it is poor drafting, and it is done by stealth. We have a great deal of confusion as a result of this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also remind the Senate that there is a substantial sales tax penalty under the Government's Bill. Because of an increase in the retail price of a new vehicle from $43,935 to $45,462 no new vehicles could be priced in this range. A $1 retail price increase above the $43,936 threshold would bring about a doubling in the quantum of sales tax payable from $4,575.72 to $9,151.44. That is the implication of this apparently simple change to the sales tax legislation. I believe that the Senate should endorse an amendment to be moved by my colleague which seeks to align the depreciation level and the threshold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In practical terms, the depreciation limit for new vehicles will fall from $45,462 to $43,936.76 under the Government's Bill. Yet this has not been publicly announced by the Government. It is a little dishonest. Under previous wholesale sales tax legislation covering luxury vehicles, a retail price void existed between $45,462 and $48,512. The interesting point about this is that within this range it was mathematically impossible to calculate the correct quantum of sales tax payable. The Tax Office had to come to the party, so it resolved this problem outside the Parliament by ruling that vehicles priced in this void should be taxed at the rate of 30 per cent applied to the wholesale sales tax threshold of $30,504.81. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this Bill, the retail void will extend to the range from $43,937 to $48,512. We have this completely unacceptable mathematical situation which is adverse to the industry. The implication of this is that the distributors of vehicles in this price range will be denied the opportunity of reintroducing to their vehicles vital and effective safety measures such as anti-lock braking systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem which this aspect of the Bill raises is with regard to the relevance of the depreciation limit as set down in section 57AF of the Income Tax Assessment Act. I remind the Senate that when the Treasurer announced $18,000 as the 1979 base limit for depreciation, in those days it was possible to buy the most expensive Australian-produced motor vehicle for less than that amount. I think the yardstick adopted was the Ford LTD or thereabouts. In 1992 a Ford LTD is priced in the $52,000 range, well above the section 57AF limit of $45,462. There are other glaring inequities in the application of section 57AF which relate primarily to the calculation of the relevant consumer price index by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When section 57AF was enacted it may well have been the case that $18,000 was not an unreasonable threshold. However, there was a substantial bias in the methodology adopted by the CPI section of the Australian Bureau of Statistics in Canberra over the last decade. In effect, the average level of change in the motor vehicles purchase sub-group of the CPI is calculated by reference to what could be described only as a fictional vehicle. It appears that acceptable standards and features that are found today in what could fairly be described as an average family car are removed effectively to return the vehicles to 1979 standards. For example, where a manufacturer was offering as optional equipment an item or items which are now provided as standard&mdash;such as air-conditioning or power steering&mdash;the value of those sorts of items is discounted. Not only does such a methodology make a nonsense of section 57AF of the Income Tax Act but it also has the effect of substantially undervaluing the limit in 1992 dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems are then translated into the sales tax legislation by virtue of the adoption of the section 57AF limit for luxury car tax threshold purposes. Obviously the Government has made the calculation change in full consciousness of the end result. Why else would it be stated so succinctly in the Bill? However, it does nothing to improve the image of the wholesale sales tax as anything other than an inefficient, inequitable and administratively complex tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that if the coalition's Fightback GST proposal were in place, the sorts of difficulties that the industry is now facing and the problems that we are now grappling with in the Senate would not arise. The Government is presenting to the Senate formulae for calculations that are unintelligible to the ordinary lay person. That a fair wholesale sales tax cannot be calculated on a range of prices just indicates the inadequacies of the wholesale sales tax regime in modern day Australia. When it was introduced, it was probably a quite fair and not unreasonable tax, but now it does not meet the needs of an efficient economy taking its place in world affairs and having to compete internationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to clause 6 and passenger motor vehicles, which are covered by Customs Tariff Act heading 8703, it is interesting to note what is not included under this heading. The vehicles which will not be considered as passenger motor vehicles for the purpose of this Bill and therefore not have their wholesale sales tax reduced to 15 per cent include panel vans, delivery vans, utilities, dual cabins, jeeps, trucks, off-road four-wheel vehicles, lorries and motor buses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What benefit will this reduction really have for business communities? This definition seems to exclude any vehicle which could typically be used by a business. The point that I am making is that, apart from the motor vehicle sales industry, there is no relief for business in the initiative put forward. The Government is trying to get as close to the 15 per cent GST rate as it possibly can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a bit of an aside, I want to comment on clause 6 of the Bill, which amends the fifth schedule. In changing the words of this schedule, it would appear that the Government is admitting that, despite its wholesale sales tax cut of 5 per cent, the Australian motor vehicle manufacturing industry is dead. What other explanation could there be for changing the classification of cars according to the import of products classification 8703?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his second reading speech, the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sales of passenger motor vehicles have suffered heavily in the economic downturn. This has had adverse employment effects throughout the economy for domestic manufacturers, retailers and importers. The reduction in the rate of sales tax for passenger motor vehicles, other than luxury vehicles, will help to stimulate demand for these vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA>One is then left to conclude&mdash;though it was not stated&mdash;that this stimulated demand for vehicles will stimulate the economy and, hey presto, Mr Keating is able to justify his pump-priming measures announced last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this is the Government's plan, I wonder what its reaction is to the announcement this week by General-Motors Holden and Toyota that they will be lifting the price of a number of popular family vehicles from anywhere between one and 3.5 per cent. The net effect of this rise will be to wipe out the tax saving which the Government was intending to lure consumers with to increase car purchases and thus help the economy. According to Toyota, the price rises are due to the fall in the value of the Australian dollar before Christmas. They are expected to take effect in the second quarter&mdash;that is, from April until June. At least in introducing this Bill the Government is acknowledging that its wholesale sales tax does have an impact on the purchasing decision of consumers and thus is a stimulus to the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now invite the Government to look at the implications of a GST. What a pity the Government does not have the courage to bite the bullet, scrap the wholesale sales tax completely and replace it with the goods and services tax proposed by the coalition. Slowly but surely in this place we are seeing wholesale sales tax changes which are consistent with what the coalition has been proposing in its Fightback package. The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991 was a good example of this. The sales tax Bill now before us alters the wholesale sales tax on non-luxury vehicles from 20 to 15 per cent, the same as would apply under a GST. However, a direct comparison cannot be made because, for example, car accessories, including tyres, still attract a 20 per cent wholesale sales tax. Of course, those in business get no relief by way of a credit for their input taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is only one of many sales tax Bills that, under this Government, we seem to pass inevitably each year in a vain effort to patch up the wholesale sales tax system. But we are making it more complicated, unintelligible, inequitable and mathematically difficult to calculate accurately the correct sales price of the item in question. I therefore foreshadow that, in the committee stage of this Bill, my colleague Senator Short will be putting an amendment that we have negotiated with the Government. That will occur tomorrow afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We wish to add at this stage that the Government has increased the amount of revenue raised through sales tax from $3.5 billion in 1982 to $9.4 billion last year. This figure would have been much higher had it not been for the recession, which has served to depress sales. Sales tax collections are down to something like 7.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of the Government's sales tax grab on households, as on others, has been particularly severe. Unfortunately, the sales tax rates are levied on a narrow range of goods which discriminate very nastily and cause massive problems in the economy. The sooner we ensure this change the better, because in the process the rates and the quantum have become very regressive and have affected a number of items quite detrimentally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore conclude by urging the Government to examine the problems that it has created, note the matters that have been raised in my speech and at least ensure that it removes this unnecessary anomaly that results in the retail price threshold for sales tax purposes being substantially different from the income tax depreciation limit. We maintain that the two should be in equilibrium and in conformity with the policy announced prior to this Bill. It can be done, and the Opposition amendment will show how it can be done, although unfortunately it is a fairly complicated formula to arrive at an equitable result. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we have already heard, the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1992, which is before the Senate tonight, deals with the change to the rate of the wholesale sales tax for non-luxury passenger motor vehicles from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. The decision was announced in the economic statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and applies to sales on or after 27 February.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision has two aims. The first is to stimulate the local production of motor vehicles by reducing their retail price and, at the most basic political level, to minimise the political advantage that the Opposition's GST proposal has over the current taxation regime applying in the area of cars. Over time, the measures proposed in this Bill are assumed to boost sales by about 12,000 cars per year, which equates to the estimated 3 per cent retail price reductions. The Australian Democrats agree that this will obviously assist the local car production industry and employment within that industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Government's political position is now enhanced because the introduction of a 15 per cent goods and services tax, which would apply at the retail level, would actually increase the retail price of all of the passenger vehicles affected by this Bill. The Opposition knows this and, I think, it is quite worried about it. Hence, there was an attempt by Senator Short at a committee hearing to introduce the question of the administrative burden which may accompany this legislation. It is a bit of a red herring. People never mind a bit of extra paperwork if they pay less tax&mdash;they can see some reward for their efforts. But if there is a huge increase in the compliance burden with no benefit, such as can be argued would occur under the imposition of a GST, people quite rightly object. This Bill will reduce the consumer price index by an estimated 0.2 per cent and will cost $275m by 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole area of the taxation of motor vehicles is certainly one where legislation should be simplified. Currently, a motor vehicle is taxed at 30 per cent, but only if it retails for more than $45,000 or if it is not specially fitted out for the transportation of disabled people. All other vehicles are taxed at 20 per cent, whether they be for commercial or domestic purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill proposes to amend the definition to align it with the description in the Customs legislation and to tax all of those vehicles at 15 per cent, thereby overturning the previous thrust of reducing the number of sales tax rates. Passenger motor vehicles are, quite interestingly, defined as being cars other than ambulances, hearses, police vans, amphibious vehicles and off-road vehicles. The Customs legislation imposes tariffs on non-commercial vehicles at a 35 per cent rate, and commercial vehicles at a 15 per cent rate. Only those vehicles which are subject to the 35 per cent duty, or would be if they had been made outside of Australia, will benefit from the lower 15 per cent sales tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see from the amendments that the Government is still following the level playing field dictum of not providing a preference for locally produced cars. A problem that confronts the community today is loss of jobs in the Australian car manufacturing industry. The stated purpose of this Bill is to stimulate local car production, not local car sales. We want more production of local cars, not more imports. Why is the reduction extended to imports? I give notice that I will be moving an amendment to ensure that the 15 per cent sales tax rate will apply only to locally produced cars. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition might deal with one of those in isolation. We have not seen an integrated approach from any party in this Parliament. Senator O'Chee might laugh, but the Opposition does not have an integrated approach. It is not a difficult thing to achieve. Australia's performance in the area of fuel efficiency is nothing short of abysmal. Figures released by the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) show that the national average fuel consumption of new cars sold in Australia was 8.9 litres per 100 kilometres and that this is expected to drop to eight litres by the year 2005. This is the worst result of OECD countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent study by Nelson, English, Loxton and Andrews, which was commissioned by the Office of Road Safety, found that Australian drivers ranked fuel consumption behind price, behind size, behind appearance and behind vehicle reliability. It also noted that car makers did not calibrate fuel engine management and transmission systems to optimise fuel efficiency. Incredibly, more than half of the vehicle models sold in Australia are 10 to 15 per cent less fuel efficient than equivalent models sold in the United States, a country which quite rightly is condemned for its rate of energy consumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study concluded that, given the right intervention by the Federal Government, national average fuel consumption in 2005 could be cut to 6.5 litres per 100 kilometres. This involves action by the Government, coordinating through its position as a major purchaser in the market the rapid introduction of existing Australian technology into all new vehicles and the use of the price system. The study advocates, too, that the sales tax regime be re-oriented on a fuel consumption basis and that a fuel consumption program be introduced with specific financial penalties applying to gas guzzlers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, a discussion paper on energy and road transport, released by Minister Griffiths, considers energy efficiency as an important issue. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The benefits of improving the energy efficiency of the transport sector would be realised throughout the economy, and would also improve the international competitiveness of the Australian economy. . . In the future, if increased energy efficiency and fuel switching measures are not realised, imports of oil could grow significantly. Improving fuel efficiency is an important aspect in the development of an integrated approach to the transport sector. Such an approach will lead to better decisions on fuel use and infrastructure. The microeconomic reform allowed by this coordinated development will result in significant savings to the community as well as reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA>The report shows that at least some of the bureaucracy is starting to look at the issue of fuel pricing in a mature way.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various Democrat alternative Budgets have proposed that the fixed costs of car ownership&mdash;that is, registration and insurance charges&mdash;be abolished and that the revenue forgone be incorporated into fuel prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report cites the various advantages of a scheme such as we have proposed: insurance costs would be proportional to kilometres driven; uninsured motorists would be brought into the scheme; the apparent cost at the pump would rise substantially, thus reducing the amount of discretionary car travel and increasing the demand for public transport; and there may be a net decrease in driving costs because of savings on insurance brokerage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats think that the report could have mentioned the fact that this scheme would promote more fuel efficient vehicles; would financially benefit motorists, such as pensioners who drive sparingly; would protect motorists from financial loss because of an accident with an uninsured motorist; would dramatically reduce the administration costs of State registration authorities; and would reduce petrol imports, thereby reducing the current account deficit. It also has the advantage of assisting family budgets, which are often stretched by the large impost of insurance and registration charges, by in effect providing a pay-as-you-drive system. So that is what an integrated policy is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late last year, Minister Kelly addressed the fortieth congress of the International Organisation for Motor Trades and Repairs in Canberra. In that speech she quite correctly stated that governments and industry can have a major role in guiding consumers to make environmentally sensible decisions when it comes to such things as buying a new car or even spare parts for a car. Recently, both Senator Button and the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Bob Brown) have stated that the Government is examining the issues of fuel efficiency and vehicle emissions. So there has been much positive talk, but in the case of this Bill, unfortunately, the Government has not chosen to do something positive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, for one, have been pleasantly surprised by Mr Greiner's proposal, announced yesterday, to introduce a nominal charge for city parking places in Sydney and to use the revenue to provide additional car and bicycle parking facilities at train stations. This is certainly a step in the right direction and something that we should all support. Indeed, the proposal to introduce compulsory emission testing of vehicles as part of registration roadworthiness tests is an excellent and overdue measure which should help to clean Sydney's air and reverse the worrying trend of ageing in our vehicle fleet. I hope the other States will soon follow suit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final report of the ecologically sustainable development working group on transport was issued after Mrs Kelly's speech and before this particular sales tax decision was made. Quite correctly, in recommendation 4, it stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . sales tax on new motor vehicles of higher fuel consumption should be increased and sales tax on new motor vehicles of lower fuel consumption be decreased on a substantially revenue neutral basis.</PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats support the thrust of that approach totally, because over time this would also substantially reduce the amount of oil which Australia imports, thereby reducing the current account deficit&mdash;about which we hear so much from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the use to which the vehicle is to be put is also a relevant factor in any decision to reorient sales tax to promote better environmental outcomes. For example, a bus is not a very fuel efficient vehicle per se, but when it is carrying 60 people it is extremely efficient in respect of its load. Much more work is needed by all governments in Australia to develop an optimal vehicle taxation system&mdash;one that should take into account fuel usage, the task of the vehicle, the vehicle's emissions and the safety features contained in the vehicle.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nor do they care. Whilst the Government has a disgraceful record of negligence towards the development of an electric car industry in Australia, it appears that there may be some good initiatives around the corner with respect to cycling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Brown announced a modest set of measures at the recent Ausbike 92 conference which are, nevertheless, good initiatives. The creation of a national cycling strategy and, more importantly, the integration of cycling into transport decision-making processes, could yield major benefits in terms of a reduction of fuel imports and an improvement in urban air quality as well as providing healthy exercise for urban commuters. What we need is an integrated system of cycle paths which do not cross major roads. Our national capital may be out of touch with the rest of Australia, in the view of some people, but it is an excellent example of cycle planning. The same sorts of amenities that exist in Canberra ought to be provided to communities in the other large cities of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An unresolved issue in the area of taxation of motor vehicles is the question of optional safety features. Because of the dramatic effect of the luxury car threshold on the retail price of vehicles, some firms&mdash;for example, Volvo&mdash;are selling vehicles without safety equipment such as the air bag and anti-locking braking systems. This then enables the wholesale price of some of the models to fall below the threshold and, hence, avoid the 30 per cent tax rate. So there we have a little trade-off: less safety, but a fall below the threshold. Clearly, this is an unintended consequence of what is otherwise a good policy of taxing luxury items at a higher rate than essentials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government should move to exempt these optional items from sales tax. The preferable method, we think, would be to specify the types of items which should not be taxed at all or, at least, which should be taxed at the normal motor vehicle rate instead of the luxury rate, so that the value of the extra features would be excluded from the sale value of the car for the purposes of the luxury car tax. This is similar to the treatment given to modifications to vehicles for the use of disabled people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government could go further and encourage the rapid introduction of fuel efficiency or other environmentally beneficial technology by excluding the cost of this technology from the taxable sale value of motor vehicles. For example, Ford of Britain has developed a new system to reduce cold-start exhaust emissions by about 80 per cent. This eliminates the great majority of exhaust emissions generated on short trips. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. I acknowledge that any government which is serious about addressing the urban pollution created by cars&mdash;and obviously that would not be the sort of National Party government of which Senator O'Chee would be a member&mdash;has to intervene to promote technology such as I have described. Minister Griffiths has taken up another ESD working group recommendation&mdash;that of compulsory labelling of the fuel consumption of new vehicles sold. This is a positive step, but providing information about fuel efficiency in isolation is not enough. It is ineffective and the Government must also provide incentive via the sales tax system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, we have the Opposition's proposal to abolish fuel excise and to tax public transport. This is an absolutely disgraceful proposition. It would guarantee a much smoggier, more congested urban environment and higher fuel imports. I do not understand how the Opposition can seriously put forward such policies at this time when the evidence all around us begs different solutions. If the aim is to address the cost of travel&mdash;which applies to people who live in rural Australia&mdash;as Senator Coulter has already indicated in a speech to the New South Wales Farmers Association, the Democrats support an excise rebate system for country Australians. This is a responsible form of targeted assistance which will not adversely affect the quality of life in cities. The total removal of the excise is simply vandalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A differential indirect taxation system is one of a variety of economic tools that could be used to stimulate sustainable development. This is one reason why the totally free market approach of a universal, single rate goods and services tax is so negligent. All goods are valued equally under such an approach, and this is a really barren way of looking at the economy and society. I will be moving a second reading amendment which condemns the Opposition for proposing to tax the necessities of life under this Fightback proposal, but I do not intend to debate that at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One recent tax decision that should be brought into the public debate is the decision in the State Bank case. It probably has very severe ramifications for the proposed goods and services tax. The facts are quite simple. The Taxation Commissioner attempted to impose sales tax on printed matter produced by the State Bank for its internal use. There is no question that that tax would have been payable if the State Bank were not owned by the New South Wales Government. Section 114 of the Constitution precludes the Commonwealth from imposing tax on the property of a State. This provision was held to exempt the State Bank from the sales tax in question. This case is important because it decided that the property of a State includes the property of State instrumentalities and corporations, even when they are purely commercial operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relevance of the decision to the Opposition's proposed GST is that the GST would be imposed on all the commercial activities of all levels of government, excluding health and education. This decision to which I am referring would appear to limit severely the tax base to which a GST could apply. As an example, let us consider the electricity industry. Firstly, in some States the coal mine, and hence the coal, is owned by the State or an instrumentality; therefore this could not be taxed. Secondly, the electricity is created by the instrumentality and is unquestionably the property of the State until it is sold. It would certainly seem doubtful that any GST could be applied on electricity charges. If it is the case, then this is another hole in the budgetary forecasts of the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, there will certainly be a distortion created between private sector banks and State banks. If State banks produce their inputs in-house they will be exempt from the GST, whereas the private banks will be liable to tax for exactly the same actions. Since financial services are exempt from the GST&mdash;that is, the liability cannot be passed on to consumers&mdash;this provides a competitive advantage to publicly owned institutions, totally contrary to the level playing field mentality of a universal GST. I wonder whether Senator McMullan might be able to tell the Senate whether the Government agrees with this assessment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I just did not quite hear what you were saying or what you were alluding to there. Anyhow, we are discussing the Sales Tax Amendment Bill (No. 1), which puts into effect the reduction in sales tax on passenger vehicles from 20 per cent to 15 per cent, which was part of the One Nation package. This applies to vehicles with a wholesale value of $30,505. The vehicles that qualify are the ones which, if imported, would attract a sales tax of 20 per cent. With Australian manufactured vehicles, if they were to be imported in future, the same reduction would apply. Contrary to what Senator Kernot has said, it applies to imported as well as Australian manufactured vehicles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The price of the average sedan in Australia will drop by 3 per cent as a result of this Bill. However, I am worried about the vehicles that are exempted from this measure. I think the Government showed good sense in reducing the sales tax on passenger vehicles from 20 to 15 per cent. That lines up with our GST package which, of course, involves eliminating sales tax and adding a goods and services tax. Unfortunately, the vehicles that are used by people in production&mdash;the ones who create the extra jobs in Australia; in the factories, in the mining areas and in other enterprises&mdash;have been left out of this legislation. Those vehicles will still attract a sales tax of 20 per cent. They include panel vans, delivery vans, utilities, jeeps, trucks&mdash;which were mentioned earlier by my colleague Senator O'Chee&mdash;off-road four wheel drive vehicles, dual cabs, lorries and motor buses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us spend a little time considering dual cabs. By leaving out those sorts of vehicles, this measure is patently twice as stupid because a dual cab can be categorised in two ways. Firstly, it is a passenger vehicle because it can quite easily carry five passengers, if not six. It can carry  six if it has a full front bench, and five if it has two dicky seats in the front and a full bench at the back, so it can be legitimately classed as a passenger vehicle. On that basis alone the tax on dual cabs could be brought down to 15 per cent, yet the Government chose to leave these vehicles out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at it the second way and applies the 20 per cent tax, that is stupid because a dual cab is a vehicle that is used in production&mdash;production of export income, or of any income. It could also be classed as a passenger vehicle that can carry a few stores and luggage if one is travelling a long distance. That fact has been completely ignored&mdash;although it is a fact that applies to some of the other classes of vehicles as well. In that case the amendment is really stupid and, hopefully, that is something that the Minister will pick up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only vehicles that have not been covered, apart from vehicles of a higher value, are station wagons or four-wheel drive cars valued above $30,505; they are taxed at 30 per cent. They are the only exceptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The downturn in the car industry was illustrated by what happened to Nissan, which cut down its operations at the cost of 1,800 jobs. That is probably what prompted this Government to reduce the sales tax, but only in relation to passenger cars, not commercial vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To create jobs in Australia and get industry going, one has to cut costs to the producers. That is the aim of the GST package. I do not criticise the Government for reducing the sales tax on cars from 20 to 15 per cent, but I do criticise it for is not bringing all vehicles down to the 15 per cent rate. The reason why the Government did not worry about bringing the cost of all vehicles down is that the people who buy those vehicles with the 20 per cent sales tax&mdash;that is, jeeps, utilities, off-road four wheel drive vehicles, lorries, motor buses, dual cabs and delivery vans&mdash;are people in private enterprise, and hardly anyone in private enterprise would vote for this present Government. That is why it left them out&mdash;for political reasons. It was not interested. By aiming the reduction at the family car, it hopes to pick up the average vote. That is the reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was recently in Melbourne, opening a new concept that Toyota Australia has come up with. While he was down there he totally ignored the Nissan complex that had closed down with the loss of those 1,800 jobs. Perhaps he could have gone around to those people and explained why they lost their jobs and why Nissan closed down altogether in Australia. That was a result of this engineered recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During Question Time today Senator Button, when he was getting flustered by Senator Alston's questioning, said, `Well, there is a recession on, you know'. Of course we know there is a recession on. His Prime Minister, who was the Treasurer at the time, engineered it. As a result of that recession car sales right across the board have dropped 20 per cent. It is a pity that it has taken the worst recession in 60 years to bring sales tax on passenger cars down to 15 per cent, but that reduction should have gone right across the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know we are here to speak about a sales tax package but, Mr Acting Deputy President, you have given the liberty to someone else in this chamber tonight to venture off the Bill and onto the GST package, and I think I should be allowed the same licence. I am sure the GST package will iron things out because it will put 15 per cent on everything. It will treat all vehicles the same way. Owners of vehicles used in the production of export goods and in other businesses would be entitled to a full rebate, thereby creating savings to business so that they would be able to create more jobs as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this formula sales tax on so-called luxury vehicles will remain at 30 per cent. In Australia any car costing more than $45,405 retail is classed as a luxury vehicle. There is a fine line between luxury and safety. It all depends on what parts of Australia the vehicle is to be used in. I have taken part in this debate at different times in this place. Generally, a four-wheel drive vehicle is a must in rural and remote areas for safety reasons. One could say that a four-wheel drive vehicle is not necessary on many country roads, but after heavy rains roads may become slippery when clay mixes with the gravel; once engaged, a four-wheel drive mechanism will tend to keep a vehicle on the road. A four-wheel drive is not necessarily only for getting people out of sand bogs or other sorts of bogs; it is used to keep people safe and vehicles straight on the road. A four-wheel drive vehicle is a necessity in those situations for safety reasons and is not a luxury. As I said, there is a fine line between the two. One could easily say that in this case the Government is putting a tax on safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The luxury class is also achieved in Australia by inflating vehicle prices through the inclusion of high import duties and tariffs. That puts the cost of the vehicle over the wholesale figure of $30,505. In Europe when one mentions that in Australia an average European family car is classed as a luxury vehicle, it is a laughing matter. When one looks at it, that is correct, whether or not one worries about safety in remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now I move to the parts of the Bill that I believe are patently stupid. Vehicles such as utilities, vans, delivery vans, jeeps and trucks will remain at 20 per cent. I have already gone into this matter and it is totally ridiculous. I have already said that they are the vehicles which help produce income because they shift produce throughout Australia and assist in creating jobs. All sales tax Bills, and anything contained in either the GST or One Nation packages, are aimed at increasing the number of jobs and not decreasing them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason that this legislation is patently stupid is that it is the first time to my knowledge that the sales tax on a sedan is lower than that on a commercial vehicle. No matter how far back one goes in the history of sales tax in Australia, that has never happened before, and yet we have it now. Perhaps the Government did not really think about it, but probably the only reason for that was to aim at those people who buy the average family car&mdash;the average Labor voter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been said by other speakers on this side of the chamber, it can be classed as an attempt to line up with the 15 per cent GST in the Hewson package. Having gone that far, I wish that the Government had gone the full length of the argument and brought in all the others as well. As I have already said, the GST will be rebated on the class of vehicles I have already mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am afraid that this package has nothing in it for farmers, miners or people living in rural and remote areas, that is, the people who are producing Australia's income. Under the GST package those people will be helped by the removal of the fuel excise. This will take 19c a litre off the price of fuel, or $11 off the cost of filling up a family car, and there will be a 26c per litre reduction in the cost of fuel to operate heavy transport vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have reached the stage with this mishmash of sales tax where it is at zero, 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 20 per cent and 30 per cent. At one stage in the 1990 election there was a vote grab and a luxury tax at 50 per cent was introduced for a very short while. However, all that 50 per cent did was cut down on the sales of cars and the Prime Minister had to quickly back down. Under this Bill the formula for the luxury car tax threshold of $45,462 has been reduced to $43,937, which is out of kilter with the depreciation schedule, and my colleague Senator Watson has covered that matter very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now I will move across to comment on a few of the remarks made by other speakers tonight in this debate. The most stupid remarks were made by Senator Kernot concerning the fuel used by Australian vehicles. Making comparisons with fuel efficiencies is all very well as long as one compares apples with apples. If one wants to compare the fuel efficiency of a vehicle in a given state, one has to compare it with countries of like size with Australia and with the same population density as Australia, Europe, the United States or whichever country it is, because, as everyone knows, Australia has huge distances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no good if one is travelling fairly regularly from Canberra to Sydney, or Canberra to Adelaide, or Adelaide to Perth, or Perth to Sydney starting out with a 1.4-litre vehicle. The vehicle will be worn out in a few trips, whereas a 1.4-litre vehicle is adequate for running around a city, going to work or travelling very short distances. However, safety is a more important consideration when one is travelling longer distances because one travels at the speed limit most of the time. The speed limit in Western Australia is 110 kilometres per hour, and when one travels mostly at night time there are kangaroos or wild horses that could bowl people over.

Senator Kernot said that when the threshold for luxury vehicles was fixed at a certain figure, things such as air bags would be left out. Senator Kernot can correct me if I am wrong, but I do not know of a vehicle that has an air bag fitted as a standard feature. I know that one can get an air bag as an option in a Mercedes Benz, but it is not a standard feature. Where is the argument?</PARA>

I do not wish to go over to any great extent the grounds that they have already covered. But there are some things that I certainly wish to say. This Bill, quite frankly, is nothing other than a political stunt. It does not improve the taxation system. It creates more anomalies between various motor vehicles and it introduces a new anomaly between the so-called luxury car price and the price at which the depreciation limit is set.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill which we are debating implements the Government's decision to reduce the wholesale sales tax on some passenger motor vehicles from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. It is part of the package of hastily cobbled together measures announced by the Government on 26 February as part of its so-called One Nation&mdash;but in reality one job, namely, Paul Keating's job&mdash;plan to buy its way through to the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the Bill is nothing other than a political stunt. In fact, we are now informed via the media, which again reflects the Government's penchant for government by press release rather than by being open and honest in this Parliament, that the Government has agreed to remove the luxury tax car threshold, having reduced it to $43,937 in what, quite frankly, has been an awful mix-up in the sales tax area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As long ago as 12 March in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, the relevant Minister, Senator Button, is reported to have said that the Government recognised the problem that has been seen by everyone other than the Government in relation to the proposals contained in the economic statement of 26 February and that the Government was looking at making the necessary changes. I am very surprised indeed that the Government has not seen fit to bring into the Senate to date the changes that reflect the Government's recognition that there is a problem in what is contained in that 26 February statement. But really, that is quite typical of this Government. The Government is consumed with trying to make a political gain whilst overlooking the burdens and costs that it has created for the rest of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What can we expect now so far as the Government is concerned? Given the statement reported in the press by Senator Button on 12 March, is there to be another amendment moved by the Government? What more changes will there be to wholesale sales taxes generally, the categories of vehicles,  the price at which a car is deemed to become a luxury car or the depreciation limit?  What can we and, more importantly, the industry expect next?  It is precisely this sort of confusion and indecision by government that is very importantly a cause of the major crises that we have in Australian industry today and the lack of confidence on the part of industry in terms of its investment and development processes generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When are the foreshadowed changes which were announced by the Minister on 12 March via a press release going to be made?  If they are going to be made soon, why have they not been introduced tonight? If they are going to be made at a later stage, why should we be pushing this Bill through the Parliament at the moment rather than waiting for those necessary changes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that, in opting for a 15 per cent wholesale sales tax rate, the Government somehow thinks it can counter the appeal of the coalition's proposed goods and services tax and the beneficial price effects that will flow on to consumers and the industry from the coalition's tax reforms. I talk about those tax reforms in the broadest sense which, of course, include the abolition of the fuel excise which will reduce the costs to industry of fuel by no less than 25c a litre and a private motorist by 19c a litre and which will have an enormous impact on the cost of the transport industry in Australia. That is, therefore, very significant for the costs of industry generally in Australia, given that the cost of transport makes up something like 25 per cent of the total cost of production in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cut in wholesale sales tax from 20 to 25 per cent applies only to some vehicles. It is obviously not designed for efficiency, simplicity or fairness&mdash;which are the three essences of a proper and equitable tax system; rather, it is designed to have the best political impact for the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government does not seem to be able to help itself when it comes to putting political gain ahead of economic efficiency or the overall interests of Australians as a whole. The reduction in sales tax does not apply to so-called luxury vehicles, which will continue to be taxed at the so-called luxury rate of 30 per cent. Let me make it clear that in saying that, the coalition is not suggesting that it do otherwise, but it is a point that ought to be noted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nor does the reduction from 20 per cent to 15 per cent apply to off-road vehicles such as four-wheel drives. Trucks, delivery vans, motor cycles, ambulances and a range of other vehicles will also continue to be taxed at the higher rate of 20 per cent. As a result, farmers, small business people and a range of other business users&mdash;the essence of job creation and income and wealth creation in this country&mdash;will largely miss this reduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reduction will apply only to eligible vehicles with a wholesale value of $30,505 or less. The Bill&mdash;and this is one of my main criticisms of it&mdash;adds to the complexity and, therefore, to the administrative and compliance costs of the already cumbersome and anomaly-driven and anomaly-ridden wholesale sales tax system. No less than five rates of sales tax will apply to vehicles: some will be taxed at nought per cent; some at 10 per cent; some at 15 per cent; some at 20 per cent; and some at 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where does that sit with the promise of the Government back in the beginning of 1990, I think, to simplify the wholesale sales tax system? I would hope that when the Minister sums up in this debate tonight or during the committee stage tomorrow, on behalf of the Government he will tell us just where the simplification of the wholesale sales tax process is at the moment. Certainly nothing seems to have happened since the announcement in February 1990 that that tax simplification process was to be put in train; nothing has been heard of it since. It is about time that the Government announced its intentions and its timetable in relation to that simplification process, if indeed there is any continuing simplification or timetable involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer to all of this is that the coalition's package of tax reforms is the only way to go, and the Government knows that. The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, was the most articulate advocate back in 1985 of the very route of tax reform that the coalition is now proposing. He said then that the abolition of the wholesale sales tax and its replacement with a goods and services tax of a uniform rate was the only way to go if we were to get the tax system of this country into line with the twentieth century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the most archaic, anomaly-ridden, inefficient tax system in the whole world. The Government knows that; the coalition knows that. The coalition at least has the courage and the foresight to put specific suggestions to the Australian people for tax reform. The Government has backed away from that at every stage and it has backed away from that at every stage since its master, the ACTU in the form of Bill Kelty, back in 1985 said to the Government during the famous tax summit which was going to change all these things, `We will not buy a broadly based consumption tax.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of day one of the famous tax summit in 1985, the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, pulled the rug on the whole tax reform process. He left the now Prime Minister, the then Treasurer, Paul Keating, absolutely stranded and publicly humiliated because he had been the most articulate and well-versed exponent of the changes that were required. That is why we are in the dreadful, anomalous, anomaly-driven, archaic tax system that we have today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's attitude nowadays on all of this was very neatly revealed in the lead-up to its One Nation&mdash;`One Job'&mdash;statement on 26 February. On 13 February this year, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian,</EMPHASIS> in an article headed `Sales Tax Reform on Hold' reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ministers preparing the statement agreed the political risks associated with being seen as responding to the Coalition's economic program outweighed any benefits in clearing up a tax system that the Government concedes privately is in a mess.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very accurate statement of the Government's view of the situation. It is playing politics rather than putting efficiency, equity and fairness into the Australian tax system. So much for the Government's so-called commitment to tax reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the essential difference between the approaches of the Government on the one hand and the coalition on the other in relation to the two packages that we have put to the Australian people for the next election. The Fightback package of the coalition is an honest, up-front, open analysis of Australia's problems, and a very forthright, honest set of prescriptions for what we ought to do to solve the fundamental problems facing the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement&mdash;or `One Job' statement; that is, Paul Keating's job&mdash;put out by the Government in response to the Fightback package is nothing more than a hastily cobbled together set of proposals, which really have no vision at all for the future of this country. If it had any vision, it would have done what the Fightback package has done: it would have abolished payroll tax, which is a tax on jobs in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did the Government not bite the bullet and abolish payroll tax in the way that the coalition has proposed? Quite honestly, but privately, the Government admits that needs to be done. Why did the Government not abolish the wholesale sales tax that Paul Keating himself, when he was Treasurer in 1985, said was a disaster so far as this country was concerned? He said that the only way to avert that disaster was to abolish the tax and replace it with a broadly based consumption tax&mdash;a tax along the lines of the goods and services tax that the coalition has produced. Why has the Government not removed, or taken any steps to remove, the $20 billion of tax impost on the business sector that we are removing in the Fightback package?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the questions that the electorate has to ask the Government. Why has the Government steadfastly refused, despite all the rhetoric about jobs, One Nation and all that sort of stuff, to back up its rhetoric with one specific decision, let alone a set of specific decisions, to correct the fundamental problems that it, the coalition and the Australian people know are at the heart of the deep-seated problems that this country faces?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major anomaly created by this Bill is that it separates the luxury car tax threshold from the depreciation limit. It is now possible for a vehicle to be priced at a retail price below the depreciation limit of $45,462 but above the new luxury car tax threshold of $43,937 for sales tax purposes. That is counter to the policy adopted by the Government in 1986 when the two prices were made common by legislation. That was a decision that we supported. Between 1986 and 1992, those two prices have been the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The depreciation limit is set, albeit arbitrarily, at $45,462 under section 57AF of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Under Item 61 of the Second Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act, there is a formula designed to ensure that only those vehicles with a retail price above the depreciation limit are subject to the so-called luxury sales tax rate of 30 per cent. That linkage was achieved by taking the depreciation limit of $45,462 retail and deeming that the wholesale price of such a vehicle was $31,564. That is, if a wholesale price of $31,564 is assumed and a wholesale sales tax of 20 per cent is applied, plus the normal dealer margin, one would arrive at a retail price of $45,462. What a bureaucratic device and bureaucrat's delight that sort of approach is! The net result is that it has created a very significant anomaly in the practical situation affecting the vehicle market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vehicles with a wholesale price above $31,564 were classified as luxury vehicles and were subject to a tax of 30 per cent. If the wholesale price of a car was one dollar over that limit, the entire value was taxed at 30 per cent. That, of course, had the effect of driving the retail price of such a car to $48,512. Hence, in all of that, there was a pricing void. A black hole existed between the maximum retail price under the 20 per cent tax&mdash;that retail price being $45,462&mdash;and the minimum retail price under a 30 per cent tax, namely, $48,512. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this Bill, the deemed maximum wholesale price to which the new 15 per cent tax applies will be $30,505. That will be the point at which the tax switches from 15 per cent to 30 per cent. Under the formula, a wholesale price of $30,505 and a tax of 15 per cent translates to a retail price of $43,937 as distinct from the figure of $45,462. So we have the situation where the luxury car retail price threshold is reduced to $43,937 but the depreciation limit for the same vehicle remains at $45,462. I am sure that is absolutely confusing to those who are listening to this debate or who will read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of it. It is certainly confusing enough for the industry and the sooner the Minister comes up with the necessary changes, which he conceded two or three weeks ago through the media, the better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see Senator McMullan here, and I hope that in summing up this debate, and particularly when we move into the committee stage, he will advise us of what the Government is proposing to do to unravel the enormous confusion, uncertainty and, consequently, lack of confidence this situation has provoked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A further adverse effect of the change is that it increases the size of the pricing void or black hole that I referred to earlier. That void now extends from $43,937 to $48,512. It becomes impossible to price a car in that range because of the large amount of extra tax to be paid once the retail price of $43,937 is exceeded. Although the legislated depreciation limit remains at $45,462, this black hole effect means that cars will not be priced at that level. Instead, the retail threshold of $43,937 will become the de facto depreciation limit. This represents a lowering of the depreciation limit by absolute stealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The price distortions which flow from this complex and unnecessary interference in the market are bad for the industry and very bad indeed for consumers. At face value, the price reductions may be welcomed by those consumers who purchase the particular range of vehicles affected, but there are also very large costs involved. One of those is the underhand protection being granted to local manufacturers whose products fall mainly in the price range under the luxury threshold. Another is the incentive which this price distortion creates to remove safety equipment such as air bags and ABS anti-lock braking in order to reduce the wholesale price below that 30 per cent tax threshold level. Any tax or intervention which openly discourages the inclusion of safety equipment should not be tolerated by this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the absence of the Minister coming forward with the changes which he says are necessary&mdash;and we have seen no evidence that he will come forward with those changes&mdash;I will be moving during the committee stage, which I understand will take place tomorrow, that this Bill be amended to allow the luxury tax threshold and the depreciation limit to be brought into line. The essential element of the coalition's amendment is to ensure that passenger motor vehicles with a retail price of $45,462 or less will be eligible for the reduced tax rate of 15 per cent. This can be achieved by amending Item 61 in the Second Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. Specifically, a reduction in the Fifth Schedule rate to 15 per cent would have the effect of increasing the wholesale threshold amount to $31,564 so as to retain the same retail price threshold as the depreciation limit, namely, $45,462. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Motor vehicles that are not passenger motor vehicles as defined under the Customs Tariff Act, would continue to be taxed at the 20 per cent rate.

The only exception to the 20 per cent rate would be off-road four-wheel drives that are cars or station wagons such as Range Rovers, which have a retail price above $45,462. These would continue to be taxed at the so-called luxury rate of 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, I will be moving amendments to be considered at the committee stage of the Bill to that effect.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to take up a problem that has been a source of confusion for tax workers, advisers and researchers and a thorn in the side of tax publishers for almost 40 years. I believe there is a solution to the problem and that the solution is in the hands of the Government via the Australian Taxation Office. The problem we have before us lies in the identification for publishing and reference purposes of decisions of the Taxation Appeals Division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on reviews of taxation objection decisions. Decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, Taxation Appeals Division, are reported under two quite different systems of identification by Butterworths and CCH, though it is the same case. For example, AAT case 6179, 1990, 21 ATR 3645 from Butterworths is reported as case X74 90 ATC 555 by CCH. That is, of course, the same case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem can be explained as follows. The publication of the AAT decisions under two separate and independent identifiers is a source of unnecessary confusion and trouble to tax workers, researchers and advisers within and outside the Taxation Office. A decision of a court&mdash;for example, Snowden and Willson, Myer Emporium&mdash;everywhere is reported under the same name and is easily and quickly found in any alphabetical table of cases. But if one is given the Butterworths reference to an AAT decision and one has access only to CCH reports, or vice versa, then finding the case involves a time-wasting search through conversion tables, verifications, et cetera. Communication between tax workers is also made more difficult. If a tax adviser is `speaking in Butterworths' to an ATO officer or another adviser who is `speaking in CCH', or vice versa, then time may be wasted on both sides while the necessary adjustments are made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone involved in writing and publishing on tax matters is put to unnecessary trouble and expense in providing dual citations. This applies not only to the law publishers but also, among others, to the Taxation Office itself, whose officers are writing letters of advice, drafting rulings and so on. These changes can be brought about simply by repealing the present sections&mdash;sections 14ZZE and 14ZZJ&mdash;which were introduced in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991. Several members of the taxation industry asked for this at the time. With the rush of legislation late last year I can understand why this was not dealt with at the time, but it should not be forgotten. This would leave sections 35 and 43 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act to operate without modification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We appreciate that there are at least two strong arguments for not making this change. They may be expressed as follows. The ATO has consistently and for a very long time taken the view that taxation proceedings in the AAT and in the Taxation Boards of Review before it should be in strict confidence. This is presumably because a taxpayer's affairs are regarded as strictly a matter between the taxpayer and the Commissioner, and perhaps the taxpayer's advisers, and nobody else. When the Taxation Boards of Review were abolished and their jurisdiction transferred to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the present sections 14ZF and 14ZK of the Taxation Administration Act were enacted. The explanatory memorandum to the Taxation Boards of Review (Transfer of Jurisdiction) Bill explained that it was done in order to preserve the privacy of taxation affairs afforded to persons under existing review procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It can be argued that the process of review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of a decision made by the Commissioner is still an integral part of the administrative process of assessing and collecting tax. This argument, which is based on the vital distinction between administration and the judicial function, would provide support for the position that proceedings in the AAT should remain confidential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are powerful considerations, but there are countervailing views. When a tax matter is appealed to the Federal Court from the AAT or directly from the objection decision it immediately becomes a public matter and is listed. If it results in a judgment, it is reported under the parties' name unless the court decides otherwise. Yet it is the same matter. Why should it be anonymous at one level of the review and appeals system but public at a higher level? It may be argued that it is only when the appeal from the AAT decision is instituted that the matter leaves the administrative sphere and enters the judicial sphere. If it is important to maintain confidentiality after the AAT stage, what then is the point of giving objectors a free choice in relation to the majority of objection decisions between seeking review by the AAT and appealing directly to the court?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might also be noted that the administrative function link between the Tax Office and the AAT was weakened when the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991 became law, giving objectors the right to apply directly to the AAT or to the Federal Court rather than to ask the ATO to refer the matter forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Administrative Appeals Tribunal hears a wide range of cases involving Customs matters, deportation, social security, freedom of information, et cetera, many of which are likely to disclose commercial, financial and personal information that could be just as sensitive as tax information. Yet all these cases are liable to be reported under the parties' names. So far as I am aware, only reviews carried out under the insurance legislation and the occupational superannuation standards legislation share the requirement of confidentiality. Even cases involving the registration of tax agents are reported so that all the world knows the tax agents' names, whether they win or lose. What, in real terms, is the difference?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, section 35 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act, if it were allowed to operate in unmodified form in relation to taxation reviews, would provide adequate safeguards for those applicants who might wish to have the confidentiality of their taxation affairs preserved. From the beginning of the system of administrative review of taxpayer-ATO disputes the ATO has insisted that taxpayers' privacy be preserved in public reports of decided cases. Administrative review here means cases heard by the Taxation Appeals Division. This has meant that cases at this level have always been reported by some unique identifier which does not include the names of the parties. This is in contrast to reports of court cases, which almost always are identified by the names of the parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1922 until 1949, when there was only one Taxation Board of Review, which published its own case reports, there was no real problem. The problem really arose in 1950, when the commercial publishers&mdash;Butterworths and the Law Book Company, commonly known as the LBC, and later Butterworths and CCH&mdash;took over publication of the Board of Review decisions. The publishers decided to go their separate ways with case identification systems. Butterworths began the series of reports called CTBR(NS); LBC launched a series called TBRD. But the two companies were publishing the same cases. Thus we had the absurd position, when we look at it objectively, in which a given decision by a Board of Review would be published under two separate and independent identifiers. For example, a case published by Butterworths as 7CTBR(NS) Case 48 was published by LBC as Case H47 8 TBRD. It becomes even more absurd when one finds that this case, on appeal to the High Court, becomes Federal Commissioner of Taxation v. Snowden and Willson Pty Ltd, under which name, of course, both Butterworths and LBC published it. When CCH took over the Law Book Company's tax subscriptions around 1968, closed down TBRD and launched ATC in its place, it continued the tradition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position has remained the same to this day. When the taxation boards of review were abolished and their jurisdiction transferred to the newly created Taxation Appeals Division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, section 35 of the AAT Act, which specifically provides for public hearings, was modified by section 14ZF of the Taxation Administration Act so that hearings before the new Division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal should be private, unless the taxpayer requested otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Likewise, section 43 of the AAT Act was modified by section 14ZK of the Taxation Administration Act. This is why we report AAT cases as AAT Case 4120 (1990) 21 ATR, et cetera, while CCH calls them Case W21 90 ATC, et cetera. I believe that the solution lies in allowing the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to hold taxation hearings in public unless the applicant opts for a private hearing, instead of the other way around; that is, the hearing of taxation matters and the publication of taxation decisions would be in conformity with virtually all the other matters in which the AAT has jurisdiction. I look forward to hearing from either the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator McMullan, or Senator Evans, who is skilled in the knowledge of the law and would be aware of the confusion arising from this dual publication. I look forward to Senator Evans's comments on the matters that have been raised tonight. </PARA>

<TITLE>Quarrying at Exit Cave</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take advantage of some time this evening to expand upon a matter that I have been pursuing in this place for some months now, and that is the limestone quarry at Exit Cave near Lune River in southern Tasmania. In the early 1950s, limestone quarrying started at the Exit Cave area and it has continued since. In 1983, amid a great amount of jubilation and fanfare, the Australian Labor Government acted under the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act to stop the proceeding of the Franklin Dam. Later, it stopped rainforest logging in the Queensland wet tropics World Heritage area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following this flurry of activity, in May 1988 the Helsham Commission recommended the nomination of Exit Cave for World Heritage listing. I will quote from a document which was essentially a heads of agreement between the Commonwealth and Tasmania, known as the Cook-Groom 29 November 1988 heads of agreement, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth agrees that the operation of Benders quarry within the Exit cave area nominated for World Heritage listing can continue provided that acceptable limits are set to the scale and development of the operation. Should any financial loss result from any limits placed on the operation, the Commonwealth will pay compensation direct to the company concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>World Heritage listing was achieved in December 1989. It has been acknowledged by the environmental management plan drawn up by Benders, and by both the Commonwealth and Tasmanian governments as indicated by the Cook agreement, that the quarry is within the World Heritage area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1991, Exit Quarry was proven to have an impact on the World Heritage values of the Exit Cave system. This is according to Mr Kevin Kiernan who, in his investigation of the matter, provided information from a hydrogeological report and field survey notes. Subsequently, Benders Pty Ltd prepared an environmental management plan to support its continued operation of the quarry. Public submissions were invited to consider this environmental management plan. I understand that 180 submissions were made by way of objection to the plans in that environment management plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 5 February 1992, Benders was permitted to undertake some blasting under licence conditions that were drawn up by the Tasmanian Department of Environment and Planning and endorsed by the Commonwealth. Part of the reason for this extra blasting was to provide a sample which would be used by Benders as part of the tendering processes for the supply of limestone to Pasminco Metals-EZ. The question of why this was allowed to happen if the quarry operations had been shown to affect the Exit Cave system is yet to be answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Monday, 24 February, the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area Standing Committee assessed the environmental management plan and concluded as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . past and present quarrying operations have indisputably damaged solution cavities, sink holes and caves that are now known to be part of the Exit Cave karst subsystem.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, it concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . and that even under the strictest environmental conditions continuing of quarrying jeopardises the area's World Heritage values.</PARA>
<PARA>This conclusion was to be used at a meeting of the ministerial council scheduled to meet on or before 29 February but which was postponed by a request of Minister Cleary, the Tasmanian Government's environment Minister. This ministerial council has yet to meet since that postponement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear, and it became clear to me this morning from his statements on the ABC radio in Hobart, that Mr Cleary accepts the conclusion of the Standing Committee. It is also clear from his comments on the ABC radio in Hobart this morning that he is concerned about compensation and finding an alternative to the limestone which is quarried at Exit Cave. They are legitimate concerns and concerns with which we would agree. However, they should not stand in the way of any decision which should be taken to close the existing quarrying operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of compensation lies clearly within the agreement of 1988 that I have already quoted from between Senator Cook and Mr Ray Groom, who is now the Premier of Tasmania. The question of the supply of limestone is a proper consideration, but it is not one to delay this decision. In fact, I cannot understand why the State Minister continues to procrastinate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 6 March in Hobart's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> newspaper, Mr Cleary asked all parties to refrain from public comment until the ministerial council meeting took place, suggesting that such comments so far were uninformed and that they could jeopardise negotiations for a satisfactory solution. However, today on Hobart's ABC radio he claimed that he needs further information about compensation. As I said before, and as I quoted previously, the answer to that question is presented in a straightforward way in black and white in the Cook-Groom heads of agreement which says that compensation shall be paid by the Commonwealth to any affected parties. I suggest that in this case it is not me who is uninformed and it is not me who should refrain from further public comment. Rather, the State Minister, Mr Cleary, has chosen to remain uninformed and ignore what is set out in black and white in the Cook-Groom heads of agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another case of claimed uncertainty concerns the question of the existence of a contract. This question could have a direct bearing on the existence, or certainly the level, of compensation which may be negotiated. The question of the existence of a contract, which should be central to the degree or level of compensation, has to some extent been enlightened by correspondence that I have engaged in with Mr Paul Salmon, the General Manager of Operations of Pasminco Metals-EZ. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I engaged in correspondence with Mr Salmon because there appeared to be some doubt about the existence or non-existence of a contract. Minister Ros Kelly was informed in a briefing from her Department&mdash;her advisers provided me with a copy of it&mdash;that on 28 February 1992 Benders had advised it that its contract with Pasminco Metals-EZ had been extended. The renewed contract was to supply approximately 26,000 tonnes yearly&mdash;the same tonnage as the recent contract&mdash;until June 1994. That advice was given to Minister Kelly. It seems strange to me that 28 February was the same day that Minister Cleary asked that the Ministerial Council meeting be postponed. Minister Kelly agreed to that. It seems strange to me that there was talk of a contract existing as of that date. To clarify that matter, I wrote to Mr Paul Salmon. My letter, dated 10 March 1992, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You may have heard of a rumour that Pasminco Metals has recently renewed a contract with Benders for the supply of 26 000 tonnes of limestone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have subsequently heard that this is not the case. However in view of the importance of the issue of Exit Cave's protection I would appreciate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.An assurance that no written or verbal contract has been entered into by your company; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.An assurance that Pasminco will not enter into any written or verbal arrangement with Benders to supply limestone until the Ministerial Council has resolved the future of the quarry at Exit Cave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You are probably aware that I have received a briefing paper from the Minister to which I will need to respond today. Your comments as soon as possible would be helpful.</PARA>
<PARA>On 12 March 1992 I received a correspondence from Mr Salmon. The letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am writing in response to your letter of 10 March 1992 seeking information on the supply of limestone to our Hobart refinery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you are probably aware, the existing supply contract with Benders Pty Ltd expires on 30 June 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In line with normal procedure, Pasminco Metals EZ called tenders for a new supply contract to operate from that date. No contract has been signed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, after full consideration of supply proposals, it was indicated to Benders that Pasminco Metals EZ was prepared to enter a new agreement with that company subject to Benders having a secure source of supply that meets all legal and regulatory requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make it absolutely clear that Pasminco Metals EZ will under no circumstances take any action that would conflict with any decision of the Ministerial Council considering the future of the Exit Cave quarry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of limestone supplies, Pasminco Metals EZ is co-operating fully with Federal and State authorities to ensure the most satisfactory solution for all parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paul Salmon</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">General Manager Operations</PARA>
<PARA>I conclude from that, again, that I am not the one who is uninformed in making comments about this; rather, it is those who have chosen to ignore this correspondence which I have made public and which clearly states the situation with regard to the contract or, in fact, the lack of a contract. Mr Salmon has advised that no contract has been signed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a State Minister who would like the discussion to go away, leaving him in peace and quiet. In fact, the situation is quite clear and leaves the Federal Minister little opportunity to do anything other than to expedite the decision on this and to follow through the Government's obligation to do all in its power to protect the areas it nominates for listing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the Minister to sit idly by, like Nero outside burning Rome, while quarrying operations continue to eat away at the fundamental values for which the area was nominated for world recognition in the first place is ministerial irresponsibility of the kind that has led to decades of environmental neglect and decay in this and other countries. I believe it is time that this matter was put to rest. There is a long history there. I have taken enough of the Senate's time in delineating some of it. I think it is time that it was concluded. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) There is no agreed definition of an emergency landing strip. An aircraft in distress may need to attempt a landing at any available aerodrome. The final decision rests with the pilot in command, who will take into account the nature of the emergency, the requirement (if any) for an immediate landing, and the performance characteristics of the aircraft. In assessing the suitability of an aerodrome, the pilot in command will be primarily influenced by the adequacy of the runway(s), the navigational and landing aids available and the prevailing weather conditions. He or she may also consider the availability of rescue and fire fighting services.</PARA>
