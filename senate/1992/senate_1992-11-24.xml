<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Leader of the Government in the Senate to the Prime Minister's promise in the One Nation statement last February that, `Within four years the Federal Budget will return to surplus'. I also refer the Minister to the fact that, far from moving towards a surplus, the Budget deficit this financial year will be a minimum of a staggering $14 billion, or 50 per cent greater than last year's excessive $9.3 billion, showing once again that a Labor government cannot be trusted to handle money.

It is all very well to blow hard about all that stuff, but as a percentage of GDP it is not nearly as dramatic as Senator Short would like to make it.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GG4">Senator FOREMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans. Can the Minister inform the Senate of the economic benefit to Australia from the breakthrough in trade talks between the US and the EC on the Uruguay Round? Does this mean that the Uruguay Round can now be brought to an early conclusion?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3249" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is delighted that the United States and the European Community have finally been able to resolve their differences on agricultural issues. This opens the way for agreement on a successful Round outcome among all 105 GATT countries, although a great deal of work does need to be done to turn this preliminary agreement into solid, bankable Uruguay Round commitments. The parties will be meeting in Geneva in the next week or so to commence the work necessary to bring the Round as a whole to a successful conclusion. There will be quite a lot of negotiation to put together the schedules of specific commitments on agriculture and other goods and services. When that happens, of course, the whole package will be able to take effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the economic benefits that will flow when it does take effect, the first and most important result of the Round's conclusion will be a much needed boost to business confidence in a period of what has been worldwide recession. That should be followed by a strong increase in global output over the next couple of years which we conservatively estimate to be worth around $200 billion a year. Global trade in services and intellectual property will be, more or less for the first time, fair, non-discriminatory and open while, of course, bringing agriculture under GATT rules will, among other things, progressively undo the gross corruption of markets by export subsidies which have so dramatically harmed the interests of Australian producers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Australia it is still our estimate that a successful outcome to the Round will deliver in excess of $1 billion in increased national income. In the farming sector the cut in the level of subsidised exports of 21 per cent over six years will mean higher world prices for important commodity exports such as wheat and coarse grains, beef, butter and cheese which together represent 10 per cent of Australia's total exports. In that sector alone, ABARE&mdash;the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics&mdash;estimates the trade gains could be in the vicinity of $900m. The savings from the reduction in global tariffs will be up to $750m in import duties. We also expect substantial benefits to flow from the increased access opportunities for the Australian service industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an appropriate occasion to put on record the debt of gratitude that this nation owes to a succession of trade Ministers from Australia who have done so much to put agriculture on the map so far as this Round is concerned, beginning with Mr Dawkins who, as trade Minister, was the single most important figure in the world in getting agriculture into the Round to start with. That tradition has been followed extremely effectively by his successors, Messrs Duffy, Blewett and Kerin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those efforts have successfully protected the interests of the agricultural exporting countries involved in the Cairns Group. Australia's chairmanship of the Cairns Group reflected the extremely influential role we played in starting these negotiations and that should be recognised, even by those churlish senators opposite.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3249" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have seen a number of reports about the very strident pressures that French farmers are placing on their Government, and the French Government may attempt to veto the agreement in the European Council of Ministers. We have had no formal indication that the French Government will act in that matter. Indeed, President Mitterrand has specifically indicated that France would not exercise a veto.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is to be assumed that France will continue to oppose the agricultural reforms but, in doing so, it looks as though it will not have any support from any other member of the European Community, at least the kind of support that would encourage it to dare to try to go down the track of stymieing the whole process. That is as it should be because there are significant benefits in a successful conclusion of the Round, not only in net terms for the French economy as a whole, quite apart from its impact on the farm sector, but certainly for all other members of the European Community as, indeed, for the international community&mdash;not to mention the developing countries. It would be an absolute tragedy if, at this stage, domestic political considerations were to intrude, and I do not believe they will in fact at the end of the day.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Government is about making changes to the industrial relations system. In order to make those changes, we believe in working with people to achieve enduring and quality change; we do not believe in working against people, confronting them, having perhaps a short term change which will be turned over and undone at the first sign of the changes in bargaining shares, leaving an aftertaste of bitterness and division within the community. We are on the side of making sure that changes are worked through the community and we are in a position of pointing to significant and quality changes that are beginning to transform the industrial relations culture of Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For bargaining between parties to work, the balance of bargaining powers must be fair. It cannot be said that an individual employee bargaining with an employer, with the individual employee meeting that employer in the employer's office on their own, is a fair balance. That is not a fair bargaining practice; that is an unfair bargaining practice and is seen by most people as being so. So when I see references to `the contract or the sack: accept these terms or be dismissed', I recognise that as being the implication of what will happen in the privacy of an employer's office when an individual employee is offered the terms that that employer wants to foist on that employee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no better reference than the transport authority in Victoria which at this moment is threatening to lock out all of its employees and engage only those who accept terms of individual contracts.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the location of Xanana Gusmao at the moment, we were informed on Saturday that he was being detained in Dili.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the conditions under which he is being held, I asked our Ambassador on Saturday to contact the Indonesian Government at the highest available level, which he did, to seek assurances that Xanana would not be ill-treated in any way. He received assurances at a very senior level that that would be so&mdash;that he would be treated in accordance with due process under Indonesian law and that he would not be ill-treated. Having received those assurances, which I very much welcome, I think we can be quite confident that there will be no ill-treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the question of access by the Red Cross, the ICRC has sought access to Xanana; that has not yet been granted. Brigadier General Nurhadi, the Indonesian military spokesman, is reported as having said that access will be permitted but he has not specified when that will happen. Might I add to the public record that the Australian Government has specifically requested the Indonesian Government&mdash;this was done over the weekend&mdash;to allow the ICRC to have such access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the role that is generally being played by the Government, all I can say is that we are continuing to monitor the situation and will continue to make representations as appropriate. We have continued to emphasise, in both public and private statements, our belief that this is an occasion for reconciliation, not for revenge in any sense of that term. I certainly hope that Xanana Gusmao's arrest will be taken by the Indonesian authorities as an occasion for the commencement of another serious attempt at reconciliation, and certainly that the Indonesian authorities will consider very carefully the implications for future harmony in the province of any punishment that may be imposed upon him.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Leader of the Government in the Senate to an answer he gave on 20 February 1991 relating to the enormous financial losses of the State Bank of South Australia and the failure of Labor governments, Federal and State, in that regard. The Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not accept the assumptions in the question when Senator Hill throws in gratuitously the words `failure by the Federal Government'. That will emerge from my answer to the question. The phrase `seemingly perilous and worrying plight of the State Bank' was not the Reserve Bank's phrase; it is the Royal Commissioner's phrase. What happened was that it was not until January 1991, as the December half-year accounts for the bank were being compiled, that the likelihood of any large loss became apparent. Senator Hill can see that from reading the Royal Commission report. The estimate of the State Bank of South Australia of a full year loss escalated very quickly from about $200m in mid-January 1991 to almost $1 billion by the end of the month. That is when the dramatic events occurred. It is true that in August 1990 the Reserve Bank did have a position paper on the State Bank of South Australia, but it does not, as Senator Hill's press release said, refer to the `perilous and worrying plight of the State Bank'. Those are not the words of the Reserve Bank; they are the words of the Royal Commissioner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since about 1987 the Reserve Bank has been in dialogue with the State Bank of South Australia about various matters. It was in 1987 that the Reserve Bank drew the attention of the State Bank to the fact that the Chief Executive of the State Bank, Mr Marcus Clarke, was both a director and shareholder in Equiticorp, to which the State Bank of South Australia had a very large exposure. That was at the beginning of 1987. It is therefore surprising to me to find that Dr John Hewson at about the same time recommended Mr Marcus Clarke as a suitable candidate for the governorship of the Reserve Bank of Australia.</PARA>

On Australia's part five Ministers, including myself and Senator Evans, travelled to Jakarta for the forum.

The outcome was substantial. Four agreements were signed and two working groups, one on trade, industry and investment and the other on agriculture and food cooperation, were established. The working group on trade, industry and investment will meet in February to look at a number of trade and investment issues. These include the growth of trade between Australia and Indonesia, specific opportunities for industry cooperation and cooperation on intellectual property issues.</PARA>

The temperature rises and falls like Canberra weather in the month of November. Let me just say a few things about the Government's White Paper because I think it is important. The Government this year delivered a $338m boost to science funding in the science White Paper including $235m revenue forgone through retention of the R&amp;D tax concession&mdash;something which the Opposition was not committed to doing but followed shortly after the Government, thus making another hole in the Fightback funding.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister for Justice.

Has that approach been supported by police Ministers from all States?  What benefits will it bring to the community?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to say that there is now a nationwide realisation that there has to be a community based approach to crime prevention and community safety issues. Certainly the police Ministers, in convening a special meeting in Melbourne late last week, gathered together a group of people, not only from business, such as the Insurance Council of Australia, but also from many community organisations with wide neighbourhood networks&mdash;I am thinking of the Australian Council on the Ageing, the National Council of Women, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia and so on&mdash;together with experts in criminology and other fields. We discussed the whole question of a strategy which would  involve a change in the expectations and culture of the community in relation to the incidence of crime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that the matter cannot be left to a simple reliance on the police forces and other elements of the law enforcement community, whether one is talking about the criminal justice system, corrections, prisons and so on. I know that we have guests from the United States in the gallery, but I do believe that rather than spending a tremendous amount of funds on imprisoning people as an answer to the question of crime and the incidence of criminal activity in our community as has occurred in some nations around the world, our approach has to be community based&mdash;based in the neighbourhood networks which can galvanise their energies and harness their enthusiasm in coming up with crime prevention and community safety programs which will prevent the incidence of crime in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this is not simply a question for police Ministers or law enforcement agencies. Indeed, the better cities program, for example, and the designing into criteria for urban planners of strategies which can help reduce the incidence of crime&mdash;simple matters such as lighting and access&mdash;are all important ways in which the community can help to deal with that particular matter. It does involve a change of culture and expectations. It is akin to the way in which the Australian community over the last decade or so has reacted to the whole question of the incidence of disease and injury in the community by looking to health measures&mdash;preventative measures in the field of health and safety&mdash;as a way of minimising the incidence and occurrence of disease and injury in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something similar has to occur in relation to the incidence of crime. I believe that with the support of Labor Ministers from Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory, and Liberal Ministers from Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania, and the Country-Liberal Party Leader from the Northern Territory, we have a very firm non-partisan Australia-wide basis for tackling this change of culture and expectation that is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we can harness the energies of community organisations in the neighbourhood networks in this task of preventing crime occurring and ensuring the safety of communities. I look forward to working cooperatively with those organisations over the coming year to get a nationwide strategy in place with full support from all political organisations throughout Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. Is it a fact that the Department of Defence decided that the Australian Army signallers who went to the western Sahara as part of a UN peace force would carry their Steyr rifles for their personal protection, as is the usual practice of Australian UN peace forces?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On deployment to the western Sahara a substantial amount of Australian equipment was seized by the Moroccans in transit&mdash;not only rifles, but also communication equipment, et cetera. We have had to work our way around that problem. I did check when the first commander redeployed back to Australia whether any of these equipment deficiencies were in any way impairing our operations and it was his view that they were not. It has taken a lot of diplomatic effort to try to free that equipment up, not all of those have been successful so far.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. It is not clear from the Minister's answer whether they have their personal weapons. Since it was decided as part of the risk assessment that they should have their rifles for personal protection, surely this is a position that is intolerable for the Australian Government. If the argument is that there is now a negligible risk, why were civilian communicators or the police force not sent, as was done in the case of Cyprus?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will check what final arrangements have been made in terms of arms carrying. On the second part of the question, I think the threat assessment has lowered at this stage. As Senator MacGibbon knows, we were committed to stay in the western Sahara only until March next year. We have made major efforts, as has Senator Evans, to try to get the UN to focus on a resolution of the western Saharan problem. The initial deployment was meant to be for 35 weeks. It was meant to settle down both sides and supervise so that a referendum could occur. Negotiations have travelled at a snail's pace. We have put pressure, through our representatives in the United Nations, to try to bring about some resolution, either to hold the referendum or to finalise United Nations' involvement in western Sahara.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator John Coulter asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Why were letters from Simon Woodley, Environment Section of GBRMPA, dated from late July to 4 August 1989, not put before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal when it heard an appeal by Island Voice against permission to construct the Magnetic Keys Development on Magnetic Island?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Is it not likely that if these letters had been produced before the AAT, the Tribunal may have reached a very different conclusion?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. The recently released Whitehouse Inquiry concluded that "No adequate insurance policy covering rehabilitation in the event of financial failure was taken out. . . as required by the terms of paragraph 3.1 of the Deed of Agreement" and "The reason why the insurance coverage required by the Deed of Agreement was not taken out is unclear". Can the Minister now shed more light on why, having pursued the matter of insurance most assiduously GBRMPA suddenly dropped all requirements for insurance with the disastrous economic and environmental results which are now all too apparent?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Answer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. The letters from Mr Woodley from July and August 1989 were not placed before the AAT when it requested documents on the Magnetic Quays case as the request for documentation was issued by the AAT in early April 1989 and the relevant documents presented to the Tribunal in late April 1989, ie. before Mr Woodley's letters came into existence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsequent hearings were concerned with the question of legal standing of Island Voice regarding the appeal of the Authority's decision and consideration of applications for Stay of Works in which such correspondence was not relevant nor do I believe it was requested by the Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The Tribunal did not reach a finding on the Magnetic Quay issue as Island Voice withdrew the appeal from the AAT before the Tribunal had the opportunity to consider the matter. The Tribunal had sat and given legal standing to Island Voice regarding the appeal of the Authority's decision, and had considered several applications for Stay of Works. If the appeal had gone ahead, all relevant documents, including the referenced letters, would have been provided as requested.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. Mr Whitehouse's report is critical of the adequacy of insurance for the Magnetic Quay site and as a result of his findings the insurance matter was referred to the Attorney-General's Department for advice. Attorney-General's Department supports the Authority's consistently stated position that because removal of the breakwalls was not regarded as a practical proposition, the insurance did not cover that eventuality. The Attorney-General's Department also supports the Authority that having regard to the terms of the permit and the Deed it would have been inappropriate for the Authority to insist on "performance insurance" (of the type designed to ensure that developments are completed in circumstances, for example, where a construction company for financial reasons is unable to complete a project), as it had already determined that a performance bond in the form of a bank guarantee to the value of $500,000 would be appropriate to ensure that the project would be carried out in an appropriate manner.</PARA>

<PARA>In response to a question by Senator Childs, the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, made a remark that the Government was in a win-win situation with workers and employers. I find this absolutely extraordinary. Here we have a Government that has presided over a situation where there are over one million people out of work under the Government's failed accord. Yet the Minister for Industrial Relations comes in here, day after day, answering dorothy dix questions, supporting a policy which has failed. Senator Cook has a habit of doing this on a daily basis.

Resort to the facts will always cripple an argument of this superficiality.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Labor Party. At that stage, there was double-digit unemployment, double-digit inflation and negative industrial growth in the economy. We then negotiated, at peak level, an accord with the trade union movement that guaranteed moderate wage outcomes, tax cuts and an increase in services provided by the State to the community so that the relative position of families would not be worse as a result of their having less income from wages. We then negotiated that package. What did it do? It meant that, during the whole period from 1983 until the recession, wages outcomes were moderate, the growth rates in the Australian economy were dramatic, and the level of employment increased amazingly so that the participation rate&mdash;which measures the number of people looking for work in the economy&mdash;rose well above the levels it had been cowed into during the period of the Fraser Government when those opposite were in power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, during a time of rapid growth in employment and rapid economic growth when the trade union movement's bargaining power was at an optimum, wage increases for the first time in our history were moderate and consistent with the macro-economic goals of the economy. Thus it was that we were able to develop an economy working in partnership with social forces&mdash;not dividing the community through fighting and warring with it, but working in partnership with the social forces to establish an outcome for Australia in macro terms which was beneficial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were then hit by the effect of the international recession. We were then hit by the effect on our exports, particularly in agricultural goods, of closed markets in Europe which had a devastating effect; the economic enhancement program in the United States for wheat; the closure of Eastern Europe; the impact on Japan of these circumstances which meant lower prices for wool and wheat out of Australia; and we&mdash;and we have admitted this&mdash;kept monetary policy too tight for too long. In those circumstances Australia moved into a recession&mdash;just like the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we have competing economic formulae. The way in which anyone indicates a true concern for unemployment is by laying down a human policy on how to deal with it and how to support the unemployed during their time of unemployment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know what created the problems for Australia. It was interest rates at 25 per cent. This Government was screwed by Mr Keating when he was Treasurer, notwithstanding the advice of people like Senator Button who repeatedly told him that his interest rates were too high. But Mr Keating when Treasurer took no notice of Senator Button or other advisers who were telling him that he was creating a situation where a massive depression would occur. That is what led this country into the depression, not the world crisis which we are now facing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the two countries of New Zealand and Australia and at what has happened over the past 12 months to wage rates in New Zealand. Believe it or not, there has been a one per cent real increase in wage rates in New Zealand, whereas in Australia there has been a 0.5 per cent decrease in real wages. Those are very interesting figures which the Labor Party ought to take into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we also heard Senator Cook talking about increases in executive salaries. I agree that increases in executive salaries at present are outrageous, but what is this Government doing about government business enterprise salaries which are paid at the executive level? It is doing absolutely nothing in an area where it may be able to exercise some degree of control. All Senator Cook is doing is trying to mislead the people by saying, `Look over here. Look over there. Don't look at the problem that we have created. Try to look at something else that is going on in this country, such as executive salaries'. I agree with Senator Cook that executive salaries are exorbitant, but what is he doing about the executive salaries in government business enterprises? He is doing absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wage increases for executive officers are occurring under an ALP Government with ALP policies and the ALP system in place. The ALP has been in government for nearly 10 years, and the Labor Party cannot now blame everything on what happened prior to 1983. The Labor Government is responsible for these policies and for the existing situation. It is responsible for the rate of unemployment and the exorbitant increase in executive salaries, or at least it carries the responsibility for not doing anything about these salaries by introducing some sort of bargaining process. It is the ALP's responsibility, because it is the one in government. It is about time the Government realised that the things it is complaining about are all the responsibility of the ALP and its policies. </PARA>

That is the sort of irrelevancy that those opposite bring into this argument and it is no wonder they are behind in the polls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Opposition talk about freedom of choice. All they do is talk rhetoric about freedom of choice. Giving an employer freedom is not creating an equal bargaining position. How can those opposite expect an individual employee who may have just left school to sit down and argue, debate and come to a contractual arrangement with an employer? How can those opposite expect them to have the knowledge or the education, to come to an agreement with an employer on an equal footing? The employer may be supported by a lawyer and advised by an accountant, and Opposition members do not even want a union there to advise the employee. Yet they argue that that is fair and equal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, if the employee does not accept the contract he or she does not have a job. Yet Opposition members argue that that is fair and equal. That is their concept of choice and freedom. Workers in this country can see through it. They do not want that sort of choice. They do not want that sort of freedom because it means that employers will have the upper hand and they will exercise it. Those opposite know it because that is what they want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite talk about the overseas experience. They did make one legitimate reference; they made the legitimate reference to the fact that in most countries overseas there is this sort of system. There is so-called free collective bargaining. If that is the case, why is the United Kingdom in a worse recession than Australia? If there is freedom of the labour market, why is the United Kingdom not booming? Why is unemployment as high as it is in Australia? Why do we see the same situation in the United States?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Free labour markets do not mean reductions in unemployment.

I particularly want to deal with the aspect of the question I asked and the extraordinary personal attack on me that came from the lips of Minister Cook. I note that the Minister has left the chamber. I was going to remind him that when he is in this chamber and is asked a question, he is not with his union mates somewhere else.</PARA></TALK.START>

He goes along the path of character assassination because he has no answer to these things&mdash;he cannot investigate them and give a sensible and proper answer in this place&mdash;just as he has no answers for the current unemployment situation. He just goes on the attack and attacks everybody instead of looking inwards at himself and his Government to see what they have foisted on the Australian public.

<PARA>I asked a straight question as to whether the Minister had seen a copy of this report and, if not, whether he was going to get a copy of it and have the matter investigated. He could quite easily have stood up and done the right and proper thing and said yes. But this Minister, Senator Cook, finds that very difficult. He is, unfortunately, in the business all the time of trying to defend these people who consistently break the law and try to hold society to ransom. It is about time that, as a Minister, he accepted his responsibilities and treated each situation on its merits and not on how he would like it to be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a brief contribution to this debate on the answer given by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) to a question at Question Time. In his contribution, Senator Lewis invoked, as Opposition members are keen to do, the situation in New Zealand. Having recently returned from New Zealand, I found somewhat extraordinary Senator Lewis's claim that after one year of the Employment Contracts Act in New Zealand wages are up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it clear on what basis that claim was made. To do that we need to look at the source of the statistics. There are no statistics on the legislation in New Zealand for workplaces with fewer than 50 employees&mdash;and that is the majority of workplaces in New Zealand. Many of the larger work sites for which there are statistics, after just over 12 months of operation, are able to retain, and are retaining, union representation and are still bargaining collectively. So, if we are prepared to accept figures for the minority of the work force in New Zealand, we must realise that those figures are affected by the fact that collective bargaining has been able to continue in a good many of those instances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the much vaunted so-called economic recovery of New Zealand, which is also often referred to in this context by Opposition members, it is true that there are some signs, in that inflation has been lowered and there has been some increase in exports. In the case of lowered inflation, as is the case in this country, one only has to speak to those families where the breadwinner is unemployed or to sole parent families about the joys of reduced and very low inflation. They will tell you that they cannot eat low inflation or put shoes on their kids with low inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the increase&mdash;slight though it is&mdash;of exports from New Zealand, over the past 12 to 18 months there has been an extraordinary increase in the exports of virgin timber in often unsafe ships out of New Zealand, particularly into Asian markets. That is an unsustainable increase in exports which is only of short term value in developing the economy of New Zealand. It is a short term, exploitative economic and industrial relations policy that takes no account of the real lives of ordinary people. The Opposition would do well to look again, with both eyes open, at what is happening in New Zealand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support my colleague and friend Senator Crane in his endeavours to ensure that the union movement in this country is not infiltrated by terrorist organisations. After all, that was the basis of the question which Senator Crane asked the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) today. It was also the basis of a rambling, ranting and thoroughly irrelevant response from the Minister&mdash;a response which has been continued by some of his colleagues on the opposite side of the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, let us get this very clear. Senator Crane has said in this place&mdash;all of my colleagues thoroughly support him&mdash;that the activities of the corrupt and venal minority of troublemakers in the union organisation are a slur on the innocent and upstanding men and women of this country, many of whom are forced into the union movement against their will. That is the problem we have to face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see Senator Sherry on the other side of the chamber rolling his eyes and throwing his head and shoulders around, as though he did not have enough opportunity to do it when he was on his feet. Perhaps we should remind Senator Sherry that the organisations that he purports to represent have done absolutely nothing to improve the rights of the individuals that are part of those organisations. Senator Sherry would like us to believe that the people on his side of the chamber support freedom of association. Yet those are the people who in the dead of night rushed legislation through Parliament last year to limit the size of unions so that one could not legally belong to a union unless it had 10,000 members. So much for freedom of association, so much for human rights and so much for free choice! The people on that side of the chamber refuse to allow Australian workers to make a decision as to whether or not they want to belong to a union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry and some of his colleagues would have us believe that there is no compulsion in joining a union. The experience of my brother when he was at school and working with a newspaper putting the colour inserts in at 11 o'clock on a Saturday night or 1 o'clock on a Sunday morning was quite the contrary. The print union said, `You, brother, don't have a union ticket. You either get a union ticket or you lose your job'. He said, `You can't do that; you don't employ me'. It said, `We'll fix you'. On top of that, it took him down for $150, which was two weeks of his net pay, and did absolutely nothing for him when the newspaper closed down. So much for free speech, so much for freedom of</PARA>

Senator Crane relied very heavily on the opinion of the Chief Executive of the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr David Edwards, who is not disposed to our side of politics. He quoted him but did not quote the particular paragraph reporting what David Edwards had to say about the allegations&mdash;they are no more than that&mdash;that have been made in the chamber today. Senator Crane might read this with me. The article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive David Edwards said he had heard similar allegations about building unions but had not seen any proof.</PARA>
<PARA>It is all very well for any of us to get up in this chamber and make allegations about people, associations or groups on the basis of facts that have not been established. It is always helpful if one is going to make allegations in this chamber or anywhere else against a group or against people that one does so on the basis of established evidence. I think much credit must be given to David Edwards&mdash;as I say, he is not a person who supports this side of the chamber&mdash;for saying that. When these allegations were put to him, he said that he had heard similar allegations but had not seen any proof. One thing that is clear today is that absolutely no proof has been brought into this chamber. Allegations have been made&mdash;inferentially, not explicitly&mdash;without any proof being put before this chamber. Someone who is intimately related with the union movement in Victoria&mdash;that is, Mr David Edwards&mdash;has said that he has seen no proof. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr David Edwards said that building unions were powerful and were not accountable to membership. Of course they are powerful. His opinion is that they are not accountable to the membership. But that is not what has been put today against the unions. What has been put is criminal activity. Mr David Edwards goes on to say that if there is evidence of this sort of activity, it should be investigated. What he is saying is that he knows of no evidence and, if there is any evidence at all, there ought to be an investigation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I table the Government's response to the report prepared by the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, following its inquiry into Australia's relations with Latin America. In so tabling the report I note that we are honoured by the presence in the gallery today of heads of mission from nearly all of the Latin American countries that are represented in Australia. I thank them for their patience in sitting through the nonsense that has preceded this tabling debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like, first of all, to compliment the Committee for its excellent work on this subject over the past two years. I would also like to acknowledge the efforts of the wide range of organisations and individuals who contributed to the Committee's hearings. Like the Committee, the Government was pleasantly surprised by the large number of submissions made to the inquiry. All of these have helped to generate a considerably greater level of interest in Latin America within political, business and academic circles in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government warmly welcomes the Committee's report. It provides a wealth of information on Australia's existing political, economic and cultural links with Latin America and, in doing so, exposes the depth and extent of the linkages which have been formed, if rather quietly, over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the Committee's inquiry, awareness of these links was not widespread. The geographical distance and cultural differences which separate Australia and Latin America have served to keep us somewhat in mutual ignorance of each other. However, I am confident that the Senate Committee's report, and the Government's response to it, together mark an important step in redressing this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report comes at a particularly appropriate time. This year marks the 500th anniversary of the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the New World, and it is quite fitting that Australians take stock of recent developments in Latin America which have transformed the nature of this region. Indeed, the changes which have occurred in Latin America over the last 10 years have been almost revolutionary in nature. Practically the whole of the continent is now governed by freely elected leaders and parliaments. This is a far cry from the situation only 10 years ago when much of the continent was ruled by the military. I should also note that governments in Latin America have made real progress towards ensuring that the human rights of all people in the region are recognised. Cuba now stands alone in rejecting the trend towards greater political freedoms and pluralism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Latin America is also being transformed economically. Governments throughout the region are now introducing a wide range of new economic measures which are designed to free up internal markets and to open them to external trade and competition. As a consequence of this, Latin America is now characterised by economic frameworks which emphasise efficiency and productivity instead of state control. In addition, Latin American countries are moving to more closely align their economies with those of their regional neighbours. This is occurring through bilateral trade arrangements, such as that signed between Chile and Mexico, and through wider intra-regional organisations such as the Mercosur and the Andean Pact. This has not, however, caused Latin American countries to lose sight of the importance of multilateral trade liberalisation. We have greatly valued the partnership of several Latin American countries in the Cairns Group. All these developments necessarily mean that Australia can and should take a much greater interest in Latin America than has previously been the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the responses to the Committee's 63 recommendations make clear, the Government is fully aware of these changes. Indeed, we have been following them closely, especially during the last three years. We continue to look for new ways to respond to these opportunities, particularly in terms of identifying potential new trade and investment linkages. It is pleasing to note that, partly as a result of the Government's promotional efforts, Australian companies have taken a higher profile in Latin America in recent years. This has been especially so in the minerals sector. The success of BHP's investment in the Escondida copper mine in Chile speaks for itself. I would encourage more Australian business people to travel to Latin America to see for themselves the opportunities which are available. The Government is keen to assist Australian companies in whatever way it can to develop economic links with Latin America. However, in the final analysis, as always, it is incumbent on these companies themselves to do the real work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government also notes that the growing depth of the relationship with Latin America is not purely one-sided from Australia's point of view. Indeed, Latin American countries themselves are turning increasingly towards our own Asia-Pacific region. Like Australia, Latin America is actively seeking to diversify its trading and political linkages away from its traditional links with North America and Europe. The Australian Government welcomes Latin America's recognition that it too is an integral part of the Pacific Basin. A number of countries are already members of the Pacific Basin Economic Council, PBEC, and the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council, PECC. Some Latin American countries which border the Pacific have expressed a keen interest in eventual membership of the Asia Pacific Economic Council, APEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has cooperated very closely with a number of Latin American countries in various multilateral matters. Indeed, Australia's multilateral ties to various Latin American countries have generally been more substantial than our links at the bilateral political level. I mentioned the Cairns Group, of which five of the 14 members are from Latin America. Six Latin American countries are consultative parties to the Antarctic Treaty and have established scientific research programs on that continent. The Government has also welcomed keen Latin American participation in the conference on disarmament, particularly in supporting Australia's efforts to secure an effective chemical weapons convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding, I reiterate that the Government has recognised that, as a result of the political and economic changes which have taken place in Latin America, the future for this region does look considerably more optimistic than it once did. The Government recognises that there are excellent opportunities for closer cooperation across a broad range of political, economic and cultural activities. I again thank the Committee for helping to focus attention on those opportunities. I seek leave to move a motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) and, very broadly, the Government's response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on Australia's relations with Latin America. I speak on behalf of the Liberal and National parties and also as Deputy Chairman of the Senate Committee that undertook this very sound, very constructive and timely inquiry. I, along with all the members of the Committee, thoroughly endorse the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that we have the Government's response, we can genuinely say that the Committee members and the Government are unanimous in regard to looking to greater substantial links between Australia and the Latin American countries&mdash;indeed, the whole region. At least 90 per cent of all the matters referred to in these two important documents have the full assent of the Australian representatives in this Parliament from both the Government and the Opposition. It is a bipartisan matter. The Minister said in his response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government also warmly welcomes the Committee's report as providing a useful framework for public discussion on Australia's relationship with Latin America. The Government has found the Committee's analysis of recent trends in Latin America to be both well-informed and relevant to Australian interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government particularly welcomes the Committee's conclusion that Latin America as a region presents significant opportunities for Australia in a number of areas, particularly in the commercial sphere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I endorse the Minister's statements. I briefly refer to the five mild criticisms that are set out on the second page of the Government's response. The first criticism is that the report tends to overlook a great deal of information about what the Government is already doing. I believe this is overly defensive on the Government's part. We have not overlooked the positive things the Government is doing that are referred to in our report and in the Government's response. But let it be clearly understood that we are not satisfied with the level of relations between Australia and Latin America. We are rebuking the Australian Government and, indeed, Australian business&mdash;especially those areas of business that can take up opportunities that are now presented&mdash;so that they change their inaction and ignorance, build upon the new open doors that are available and make sure that we live up to our opportunities. So if we have overlooked a certain amount of what the Government is doing and if the impression has been given that we are critical that the Government is not doing enough, then the Government has certainly got that message right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second mild criticism is that the report tends to look at the region in isolation from Australia's relations with the rest of the world. Certainly, our inquiry has been focused on Latin America. We have not tried to put Latin America in perspective with regard to Australia's relations with the rest of the world. However, we have said&mdash;for instance, in recommendation 14&mdash;that one per cent of Australia's exports are going to Latin America and that we would want to see that figure rise to 3 per cent by the end of this decade. That does give some perspective to the commercial links and possibilities that we see developing between Australia and this region. Of course, the great majority of Australia's commercial exchange is with Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third minor criticism is that we have not ranked our 63 recommendations. The Minister certainly got it right when he referred to recommendation 31: the Committee regards the setting up of a task force as a key recommendation. It seems that the Minister and the Government have fully accepted that key recommendation, and I welcome that. At least 50 of our recommendations can be treated alike: they all need to be implemented and they all need to be responded to in the positive way that the Government has done in this statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth mild criticism is that we did not refer at any point in our report to the environment. I accept that criticism from the Government. We were so overwhelmed with the wide range of areas that we could report upon in this report that we did leave aside the important UN conference in Brazil and the priority increasingly given, and rightly so, by the Latin American countries to environmental concerns about the Amazon jungles, Antarctica, and practices in each country&mdash;both in the city and the countryside. Of course we want to endorse all that can positively be said about the environment. I welcome the Government's statement that it will include environmental matters in the work of the task force over the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Liberal senator seeking to represent free enterprise and to give maximum encouragement to free enterprise, I accept that we must involve the private sector in all that the Committee has recommended and all that the Government has responded to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As our contributions are limited to these few minutes at this point, I have one clear proposal: now that we have the report and the Government response, I put to the Government that, with the cooperation of the Committee, there should be a translation of a summary of the report and the response of the Government into Spanish and that this new combined publication in the Spanish language be made available to the Latin American countries with the full assistance of all of the ambassadors from Latin America who are resident here in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise that those ambassadors are present in the gallery behind me, along with the principal officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade involved in Latin America and the members of the secretariat of the Committee. With their assistance and with the assistance of our five resident ambassadors in Latin America, I wish to see seminars held involving four elements&mdash;government, parliament, business and academics&mdash;one seminar to be held in each of the major cities of at least the eight countries during this coming year of 1993, from which there is some feedback, some response, and that reports of those seminars come to the Government and this Parliament so that we can hear a response from our counterparts in the Latin American countries to what we have determined in Australia. I hope that the Government will positively respond to this extra program, this extra suggestion, which I believe would be a very positive way of acting alongside the task force that is to meet in the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quibble with the response to recommendation 31 to the extent that I believe we should have four quarterly meetings of the task force during 1993 and then two six-monthly meetings during 1994 rather than the four-only meetings that the Minister has just suggested. I hope that that point is negotiable, as I see the task force as being the principal coordinating body in carrying forward all that we have in the report and in the Government's response. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank all of the ambassadors from the Latin American countries who are resident in Canberra, including the four members of the diplomatic community who gave path-breaking evidence to the Committee in the course of this inquiry. I particularly thank the other seven members of the Committee for their diligence and hard work on a very long report&mdash;one that took some 14 months to complete but one which will be very worth while in the Australian body politic in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I tabled the report in June this year, I registered the conviction of Committee members that Australia was in danger of missing out on trade and other opportunities in some 20 countries of an increasingly revitalised Latin America. We were hopeful that the Government would take up the report and its 63 recommendations in order to substantially improve relations between Australia and the republics of Latin America across a wide spectrum of activities. The challenge was to demonstrate that Australia has the capacity to project ahead, plan and put in place an appropriate framework for developing relations between Australia and a vital region but without neglecting the efforts that we rightly put into relations with Asia. It is with pleasure today that I note the Government's response to this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first and most important response was to signal Australian Government recognition of Latin America as a region of importance to Australia&mdash;not in the same category of importance as Asia, nor with the same immediacy, but nevertheless as a vitally important region in the next decade. The policy framework, I am glad to note, has been set in the Minister's response. The Government's lengthy response itself will be a large body of useful opinion and information for the Australian community in a readily accessible form on many aspects of the Australian-Latin American relationship. Very importantly, it gives an up-to-date account of the action that the Government is taking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to note the Government's acceptance of what I believe are two major recommendations in the report. The first is recommendation 31, on the setting up of an interdepartmental task force for a period of two years to be chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. This task force will be responsible for the vital role of canvassing and disseminating practical information and coordinating development of government policies on Latin America. I stress, from all the evidence that we on the Committee received and assessed, that the role of this task force in coordinating will be vitally important. There seemed to be a great lack of coordination between Government departments on some aspects of the relationship with Latin America. That will be an important factor to overcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task force, of course, will also be a first point of reference on matters relating to Latin America. Indeed, some of the problems identified by the Committee, which form the basis of recommendations that the Government has accepted, will be coordinated by this task force. I refer, for example, to recommendation 2, on the collection and compilation of statistical data on Latin America, and recommendation 32, on the coordination of cultural and trade promotion activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second important acceptance by the Government is that of recommendation 26 for a second weekly flight from Australia to Argentina and in reverse by Aerolineas Argentinas. As Chairman of the Committee, I expect that next April, at the end of the Southern Hemisphere summer, Aerolineas will continue with a second weekly flight each week of the year thereafter. A second weekly flight certainly would facilitate travel not only to Argentina but also to the immediate neighbouring countries of Chile, Brazil and Uruguay. I am pleased to see that the Government has not only indicated that it accepts this recommendation but has also already implemented it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, I welcome the Government's response. If we are to achieve a richer relationship with the republics of Latin America across a wide spectrum of activities, a great deal needs to be done. There is still an uphill battle to put in place the measures that will consolidate Australian-Latin American links&mdash;measures ranging from development of language skills, the issuing of visas and improving transport links, to the broader matter of increasing awareness in the Australian community and specifically the business community about the countries of Latin America. But I am confident that with the combined effort and goodwill of the Government, business and the academic community, and with the close cooperation of the Latin American representatives in Australia, we will in time achieve the aims that the Committee set out in its report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak, albeit very briefly, to the Government response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on Australia's relations with Latin America. I have only just got the response and therefore I cannot address it in detail, but I think that already it has demonstrated the value of the Senate Committee's work in this important area. Basically, it has forced the Government and the bureaucrats to address what I would describe as the underdeveloped relationship between Australia and the Latin American countries and the enormous potential to further extend the relationship to the benefit of both sides. So I rise, firstly, to give credit to the Senate Committee. I think its work in this area will have a long term benefit for Australia. This is another instance of the parliamentary committee system doing valuable but often unsung work for the benefit of the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reflect upon the fact that it seems to me that, in my 11 years here, really only in the last few years has the profile of Latin America risen, and I have wondered why. Firstly, I think it has occurred due to the endeavours of the Latin American missions in this country, particularly the heads of mission. In the last few years they have put in a real effort to educate Australia as to the opportunities that exist within their countries and to really demonstrate that Latin American countries are not so far distant nor so mysterious as they seem to be to Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their work has not only encouraged the Senate Committee, but also it has better informed this Parliament and, therefore, encouraged the Parliament to better inform the public. I give them and the Senate Committee credit. Thirdly, the successful realisation of opportunities by such Australian companies as BHP in Chile has really opened the eyes of other Australian companies and business enterprises as to these opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Success breeds success, and the benefit in dollar terms for Australia that is coming out of such investments is encouraging others. I am pleased to hear that not only are Australian mining houses now actively seeking joint ventures and investment in Chile, but also they are now pursuing new opportunities in Argentina, Colombia and Peru. Obviously, there will be enormous benefits for Australia in investing not so much its capital, but particularly its expertise and experience in mining development within Latin America in ways that will bring benefit to us all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Committee and the fact that the Government has taken the Committee's report seriously and sought to address its recommendations in a constructive way.

I also commend my colleague Senator Teague, whom I would describe as an activist in terms of his personal endeavours in seeking to further develop this relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously transport links are critically important.

The direct air link to Buenos Aires is vitally important and I am pleased that a second flight is starting. As to the LAN-Chile link, I think there is approximately a 12-hour wait in Tahiti to meet up with a Qantas flight. Those sorts of things astonish me. Presumably there is some sensible reason for that, but it seems to me that if one is trying to encourage business linkages, one makes sure that flights such as that meet to facilitate efficient trade. Transport links need to be further developed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunities for business investment and trade within Australia need to be further promoted. I am pleased that Austrade is now operating its Latin American network out of Buenos Aires rather than from Miami in the United States. Nevertheless, Latin America is an enormous geographic region and one would hope that there will soon be a more complete network of Austrade representation that can further support Australian business endeavours. Education and communication of the opportunities also seem to me to be vitally important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, Australian business is starting to recognise the opportunities that are coming out of the development of the economies of the region, particularly the enhancement of the market process within the region. Some of the economic achievements in recent times have been astonishing and present real opportunities for us. Australian business is also encouraged by the return to civilian government by so much of the region and the democratisation process generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Really it is just a start, but, as the years progress, provided that transport links and education are improved and such facilitating organs as Austrade carry out their tasks, the relationships will become much more comprehensive and valuable to us in Australia. It demonstrates one further lesson: the danger in Australian foreign policy of orientating our direction simply towards the acknowledged opportunities in Asia; we run the risk of missing out on great opportunities that exist elsewhere in the world. Those opportunities within Latin America, as has been demonstrated by the work of the Senate and the response of the Government, are just another example of the benefits that can come from broad vision rather than narrow vision. </PARA>

The Committee's recommendations have been analysed in detail and the response is there in depth. Of course, changes have already been occurring in terms of the relationship. There is no doubt about that and much of that may be attributed to the extraordinary work of the Latin American diplomatic community here in Canberra, both as a collective and as individuals. I am pleased to see so many representatives of that community here in the gallery this afternoon as we debate the Government's response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only has there been an improvement in relations on a business-like basis, but also a great many friendships have been formed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was significant&mdash;indeed, it was symbolic&mdash;of the changed relationship that when President Bush made his announcement during the American Presidential election campaign in Humboldt, South Dakota, of an extension of the export enhancement program, the two countries with which Australia cooperated most closely on that vexed question were Canada and Argentina. It is now a matter of history that there has been a breakthrough on the GATT and, hopefully, there will be a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of talks. Much of that could not have been achieved without the close cooperation that has developed between Australia and a number of the republics of Latin America. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On matters of politics, it is particularly useful for us to note that there has been a democratic revolution occurring and continuing to occur in Latin America&mdash;a reversal of the period 1964 to 1973 where, from the overthrow of President Goulart in Brazil to the overthrow of Allende in Chile, very brutal authoritarian regimes developed and stayed in power for some time. All that is now in the past.

We found some reluctance to respond, some lack of enthusiasm from various people in government departments who initially gave evidence and who did not seem to be willing to pursue matters further. I am pleased to learn from the Government's response that this has changed. Certainly the Government has put a deal of time into responding to the recommendations made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an aside, can I say that it is a ridiculous system where we were given this response half an hour ago and then are expected to debate and comment sensibly on it.

I do however, by glancing through it, note and acknowledge that the Government has taken some interest in the recommendations and has seen fit to comment on all of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a little disappointed in the introduction of the Government's response. It does seem to be fairly defensive. It indicates that the Government was going along the right track as far as Latin America was concerned. It is, however, my understanding that the interest the Government took in Latin America certainly got a boost as this Committee worked through its reference and the Government did then become more and more interested. Up until that time, there was not much evidence of any real interest by the Government. Certainly, since the report has been issued, it has stirred more action from the Government and government departments. For that, I am most pleased, and that is a great recommendation of the Senate committee system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, in its introduction, made some reservations which I thought were rather disappointing. It indicates in its first reservation that there was a lot of information already around about the Government's existing activities in Latin America. As I mentioned, the Committee found some difficulty in getting together a lot of information about Latin America in its early days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second of its reservations, the Government indicated that Australia's priorities are in Asia&mdash;the South East Asian and Pacific region. The Committee understood that from day one and we at no time suggested that Australia's main focus should move off the region in which we live. We did say, however, as other members of the Committee have mentioned, that the Government should be paying more attention to Latin America.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third reservation from the Government seems to suggest that we should have prioritised the recommendations. As other honourable senators have mentioned, we consider all of the recommendations very important, and it was for the Government, of course, to respond to all of them&mdash;not only to some of them or in descending order of importance to it. Further in its response, the Government says that we should have made recommendations concerning private enterprise, not just government. I cannot quite follow that. Many of our recommendations&mdash;for example, our recommendation on the dairying industry, and recommendation 24 which relates to chambers of commerce and business councils&mdash;have a very significant relationship to private enterprise and do not involve just government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased that the Government has taken up recommendation 31 and instituted the task force.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a bit disappointed with the response to recommendation 37, which was a relatively minor recommendation about having native Spanish speakers who do not have Australian teaching qualifications being employed as assistants in the teaching of the Spanish language. In recommendation 38, which concerns arranging teacher exchanges, the Government simply refers to some forum being set up under the Australian Educational Council and then comments that these matters are likely to receive attention from that forum. I had hoped that the Government would have been a bit more positive and said that those matters definitely would receive some attention and that the recommendations we made would be brought to the forum. The response just seemed a bit light. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are obviously a lot of other matters that could be spoken about if we were not on a time limit and if we had had a little bit more of an opportunity to read these responses before we were required to debate them.  But again, I thank the Government for its answers, such as they are, and recommend the report and the response to Australians generally and to people who are interested in trade. It certainly has brought Australia and Latin America closer together and augurs well for the relationships between our respective countries in the future. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Film, Television and Radio School has had a distinguished existence in the last few years. For example, over 40 awards, including Silver Hugos at the 1991 Chicago International Film Festival, were won for two 1990 third-year student films. Twenty of the 68 internationally distributed AFTRS student productions were broadcast throughout the year, particularly in Europe. The third-year production in 1992, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Road to Alice</EMPHASIS>, won a special commendation at the Melbourne International Film Festival. The director of that film, Stavros Efthymiou, was named young film-maker of the year at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. So this organisation, which like all is suffering from some restraint in expenditure, is maintaining high standards while naturally having to cut its cloth to suit the changed times of the recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chairperson of the school, Ms Robin Hughes, made the point that it is vital to maintain and increase the quality of the work, despite a reduction in real funding. She also said that there needs to be a greater integration of all the many and various activities if the school is to maintain standards within its shrinking resources. She continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is time now for a rationalisation of resources.</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly that is a point that the Opposition has been making in respect of this and other areas of the arts, without necessarily diminishing the quality of the work being done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I find it extraordinary that the recommendation of the coalition, in opposition, that there be greater efficiencies and some cuts in administrative spending within the arts is trumpeted by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) as being some kind of savage slash to arts funding. Yet here we have clear evidence of how a body, suffering from cuts in arts funding by this Government, is quite properly coping with that problem by rationalising its activities. In other words, it can be done and it is being done by these organisations, despite the extraordinary nonsense coming out of the Minister for the Arts every time we talk about the clear scope and need for rationalisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Australian Film, Television and Radio School for recognising that there is a capacity for rationalisation. It is proceeding with it. As Robin Hughes, the Chairperson, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to maintain a flexible stance that will allow us to continue to respond to the opportunities to develop a higher profile in the Asia Pacific region,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that can earn revenue for Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to use our excellent international reputation to enhance connections useful to the industry overseas, while at the same time never forgetting that our true and central purpose is to continue to produce for the Australian film, television and radio industry professionals of outstanding calibre.</PARA>
<PARA>According to Robin Hughes, the task for the coming year and future years, under what will clearly be tight financial conditions no matter who is in government, is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to ensure that any changes that follow from this process serve only to enhance the quality of education offered to all students and users of the AFTRS.</PARA>
<PARA>I say amen to all that. All I hope is that the Minister for the Arts stops misrepresenting the coalition's rational arts policies, which do not cut by one cent the amount of money going to arts-based art. In other words, funding on arts criteria will be maintained in full. The only areas where there will be cuts are those which are frankly political, other arts grants which are not based on arts criteria or where there is clear scope for rationalising and tightening administrative costs, such as the Film, Television and Radio School is quite properly showing it can do and is doing. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to refer to a few items in this document. Firstly, the Australian National Maritime Museum is seeking additional funds of $784,000 in this Advance, which is maintaining a level of request that has been quite high in recent times for a specific set of reasons. As the request outlines, the Australian National Maritime Museum is seeking funds to cover a shortfall in revenue, accounts that were carried over into 1992-93 and additional supplementation agreed to during the 1992-93 Budget discussions, all of which were unforeseen at the time the Supply Estimates were formulated. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As at 30 September 1992 revenue for the ANMM is down in excess of $200,000. </PARA>
<PARA>It obviously hopes that the main revenues for the Museum, which are due in the December-January period, will be stronger. This dramatises the fact that there is an absolutely vital need for the greater promotion of the benefits of this Museum and its attractiveness. It is an outstanding museum. I hope that there is a greater attempt to promote it in a much more commercial way than it has so far been promoted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this is now getting to be a pretty big bill. The Department of Finance agreed that the Maritime Museum would receive an additional $2m last year to cover a shortfall against its appropriations. But only about $1.3m was provided. So this year there has been an additional $674,000 included in the Additional Estimates to cover that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, at the time the Supply Estimates were due, the Maritime Museum funding for 1992-93 had not been resolved. Subsequently, an additional $1.5m in unanticipated costs and half a million dollars in revenue shortfalls was agreed to. After taking account of the timing of the receipts and payments for the Maritime Museum, the Supply Estimates were understated by $726,000, which is currently coming up for review. I regret that the Museum is not doing as well as it deserves to. It will have to look to much more aggressive ways of raising revenue and to adopting a much more commercial approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Film and Sound Archive is also after more money. The total amount required is $690,000. However, I must commend the Film and Sound Archive for one element of this additional cost. It relates to having a computer upgrade and buying computers at an earlier date than it would normally have had to put up the money in order to get a discount of about $45,000. The Archive was advised that placement of an order for the computer upgrade before 25 September 1992 would result in a saving of $45,255 and a total price of $185,000, as against a price after 25 September of $228,755. This expenditure was unforeseen when the Supply Estimates were formulated. But I am pleased to see that a government department is prepared to make suitable arrangements to try to get that kind of discount for early purchase. It shows the flexibility that would be good for some other departments. I commend it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I want to raise very briefly relates to the Australian Customs Service, which wants $455,000. This requirement for extra funds arises from an unforeseen payment of $455,000 awarded to a New South Wales company by the courts. I would have thought it would be reasonable to tell us what that was, but we do not know. We are asked to provide the money without being told much about this. Was the Customs office wrong? We just do not know the basis on which this unforeseen payment is to be made. All we know is that the sum was not anticipated for payment during the Supply period. I think it is up to the Customs Service to let us know. It would be nice if the Minister could suggest that that be done in these applications. </PARA>

<PARA>There is a request for an act of grace payment to Queensland Alumina Ltd for $3.9m, representing interest on customs duty paid under protest by the company and subsequently refunded. I do not know the background to this but it is worth noting that the Government is recognising that it had a moral obligation to pay interest on the customs duty paid by Queensland Alumina under protest, which it subsequently refunded. Because of that moral obligation, it has accordingly approved an act of grace payment for the $3.9m on the condition that Queensland Alumina grant the Commonwealth a release and indemnity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder what interest rate the Commonwealth paid on this debt. It is good to see that where the Government is demonstrated to have been in the wrong, it is providing interest on that debt. I would like to make the point that under our proposed GST arrangements any refunds of GST that have to be paid to people who have paid GST and which are not made within a very short period will be subject to interest rates. So if the Tax Office does not pay refunds promptly, it will have to pay interest. I am glad to see that at least other elements of the Government take that view, which is not a view currently in vogue in the Tax Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter that I would very briefly like to raise is that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade requires $188,000 for the payment of compensation to the Government of Iran and the staff of the Iranian Embassy following the attack on the Embassy on 6 April 1992. This is to pay compensation to the Government of Iran in respect of damage to furniture, fittings and equipment and miscellaneous loss and damage to the Embassy and for the theft of $US65,000. This is what intrigued me. Has the $US65,000 been recovered? I do not remember hearing of that in the court case. I do not remember reading about it; maybe because I did not notice it. I did not note whether anyone has been prosecuted for the theft of that money. I wonder what stage the Government is at in seeking to recover that $US65,000. It may be that I have not followed it closely enough. It is one of those issues that should be taken up. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

It is impossible in the five minutes that I have to consider this report to discuss all the aspects of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been the case that some departments have been able to provide us with at least a draft copy of their annual report by the time of Estimates. That was the case for one large department with which I was involved. It does not seem to have been the case with the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services this year. It has not even managed a draft annual report. The year before it did. It would have been most helpful if it could have done that. At least we now have the report before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Page 35 of the report mentions the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the effect that the co-payment&mdash;it was introduced for the dispensing of a prescribed drug&mdash;has had on reducing the number of drugs that have been dispensed. As I said, this report has only just been tabled but when I looked through it I could not find&mdash;I may stand to be corrected&mdash;anything about the Medicare co-payment. The Department talks about all the things it has done during the year but it did not talk about the fact that before Christmas last year we introduced in this Parliament a Medicare co-payment which was aimed at reducing overservicing in general practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report does not&mdash;and I will stand corrected; I have flicked through the pages&mdash;emphasise that a number of studies commissioned by the Department were undertaken to look at what the Australian public thought about the introduction of a co-payment system for attending a general practitioner. Taxpayers' money was used on those studies which found that an overwhelming number of people believed it was appropriate that a small co-payment be made when visiting a general practitioner. People understood that there was a cost involved. They understood that they should not visit a general practitioner on just a whim; that there should be a need to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating needed a couple of votes this time last year&mdash;I can see that Senator Cook is smiling, because he knows that I am right. His arm was twisted up his back. Despite these findings and despite the acceptance by the Australian public, the concept of a co-payment was taken away. This was about buying a couple of votes in order to kick Mr Hawke out of the Lodge so that Mr Keating could move in. Those details are not reported anywhere in this annual report. However, I expected that we would have seen some reference to the concept being introduced and then the baby being thrown out with the bath water. As I said, I stand to be corrected, but at first glance it is not in the report. It is not listed in the index. If the report were really up front, I believe this would be in the index, as is the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is another indication that Mr Keating was prepared to throw out something that was accepted by the Australian public&mdash;something that was going to reduce the strain on the public purse. Some of the money that was being used in over-servicing could have been redirected to some other aspect of health. But that concept was sold out because Mr Keating wanted to get one, if not two, votes for his leadership bid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this says a lot about how frustrating it must be for some of the people in the Department. These people set up a scheme which had the support of the public and which was going to do something about reducing overservicing, only to have it thwarted for political reasons&mdash;the buying of a couple of votes for the leadership. That was appalling. </PARA>

<PARA>The Corporations and Securities Panel is interesting in that it is designed basically to back up or support the Australian Securities Commission in determining improper behaviour. The panel was set up because the previous regulator of the market in respect of the control of Australian companies, the National Companies and Securities Commission, ran the risk of being perceived as prosecutor, judge, jury and executioner. The establishment of the panel is partly a move to have peer review of the difficult concepts of acceptable behaviour and market integrity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two problems emerge from this. One is that there are massive disagreements, apparently, within the business community about what really this panel should properly do. In fact, the panel has been able to complete only one examination&mdash;the Titan Hills determination relating to a takeover&mdash;and this was subject to much litigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The panel takes the view in its annual report that this examination was ultimately worth while because it established a lot of precedents under which it could operate. The interesting point is that whereas for 1991-92 $249,000 from the Securities Commission's budget was allocated to the panel, the annual report for that year shows that the panel's expenses were $231,753. So, as we can see, the panel almost expended what was allocated to it despite the fact that it really only had one investigation. As I said, obviously that one investigation was far more expensive than would normally be the case. In fact, as the report says, the operational expenses of $132,025 wholly comprised the Titan Hills determination. Hopefully, that situation will not exist when the work of the panel settles down. The other expenditure related to such things as members' annual fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have clearly a situation where it is going to be expensive to have this kind of additional panel. It is going to be interesting to see whether the panel will be able to get through in 12 months more than simply one determination. There clearly is a need in the markets for there to be some sort of peer review of the difficult concepts of acceptable behaviour and market integrity. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>I have much pleasure in presenting this report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act. The report will probably become identified in time, as is the wont of this place, as the McKiernan report on family law. This is somewhat unfair as it is truly the work of 10 dedicated, hardworking members of parliament. It is in every sense of the word a committee report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank my colleagues on the Committee, particularly the Deputy Chairman, the honourable member for Kooyong, the Hon. Andrew Peacock MP. Much has been said and written, not all of it kind, about my deputy. Notwithstanding the idle chat and advice I received from colleagues on this side of the chamber about how I should work with Mr Peacock, at the presentation of this major report I have nothing but praise and gratitude to direct to him. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His parliamentary experience and knowledge of the legislation was of enormous benefit to me personally and to the Committee as a whole. His loyalty and assistance during the inquiry greatly enhanced the Committee's ability to approach its difficult task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank other Committee members, Senator David Brownhill, Senator Rosemary Crowley, Senator Margaret Reid and Senator Sid Spindler, and from the House of Representatives Mr Russ Gorman, Ms Carolyn Jakobsen, Mr Michael Lavarch and Mr Alisdair Webster, for their hard work and dedication to their task. Family law is an area about which people can have strong views. It is much to the credit of the Committee members that such a strong degree of unanimity was reached on the many issues under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to thank the staff of the secretariat, both present and past. The Committee experienced some difficulty in staffing for much of the first 10 months of its operation due to reasons unrelated to the Committee. Thankfully, earlier this year the Committee eventually achieved a stable secretariat. On behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank the staff, particularly the Secretary,  Robina Mills, the legal adviser, David Wallace, Fiona Taylor, who found herself holding the fort alone in December and January, Donna Christophers, who developed the database for the Secretariat, and Lesley Cowan, who did a sterling job in supporting the secretariat and the Committee and who was responsible for putting the report into its final publishable shape. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time does not allow me to further extol the quality of the secretariat. However, I make special mention of Robina, whose exceptional competence and ability I do not believe have been fully realised and utilised in this place. Further, I have ensured that David Wallace's significant qualities have been duly relayed to his superiors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subject matter of this inquiry made it a particularly difficult area in which to work. The number of submissions was extremely high by any standard, but it is not recorded in the report that staff were often fully engaged in dealing with the immediate demands placed on them with the telephone inquiries and responding to letters. I commend the way they went about their monumental and difficult workload and the quality of their work. I also record my appreciation for the support that they have given to me personally and to the rest of the Committee during the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must also thank my own electorate office staff who had the task of dealing with many of the complex and varied telephone calls asking about the inquiry. This was a particularly heavy task in the early stages of the inquiry and I suspect it is something that will be repeated in the coming months. Sue Reid, Stella Files, Ken Travers, Trish Cowles, Marianna Serghi and Anita Stergio have my gratitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry into the operation and interpretation of the Family Law Act 1975 was announced on 13 March 1991, with the establishment of the second Joint Select Committee. The inquiry was prompted by the concern expressed by some members of the Parliament, in particular by my colleague Senator Brownhill, acting on behalf of many constituents who had made representation to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's terms of reference required us to inquire into the court's counselling service and the role of mediation and marriage guidance, the resolution of custody, access and guardianship disputes, the enforcement of Family Court orders, the resolution of property disputes, including those between de facto couples, the exercise of discretion by the courts under the Act, the appropriateness of the current adversarial legal system for the resolution of family law disputes, the cost of legal proceedings in the family law area and whether the current restrictions on the full publication of proceedings in the Family Court should be eased. The Committee has previously reported to the Parliament on the matter of the retiring age of judges of the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terms of reference did not include any examination of the child support scheme or the child support legislation. However, so numerous were the complaints made to this Committee and to members in the course of their electorate office work that the Committee felt compelled to comment on issues relating to child support, both the operation of the legislation and the operation of the Child Support Agency. The Committee has not transgressed its terms of reference by making recommendations in relation to these comments, although it does urge the Government to take note of the concerns expressed in the report on the very important matter of child support and the current problems being experienced by many non-custodial parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child support is an integral area of the family law system. It is a factor to be considered in deciding a property dispute. The amount of income and assets a non-custodial parent is left with after settlement can have a huge bearing on the extent and quality of any continuing relationship with the children. The Committee emphasises its support for the scheme and the principles underlying it. However, it is obvious that some fine-tuning is needed to avoid the many hardships currently being experienced by many non-custodial parents and, where remarriage has taken place, on their new spouses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's major concern is that parents may not now be sharing equitably in the support of their children, that the custodial parent is sometimes seen to be faring very well under the new scheme at the expense of the non-custodial parent, many of whom appear to be becoming impoverished. The formula seems to be too inflexible and not capable of enabling relevant expenditure, such as existing mortgage payments, school fees and utilities payments, to be taken into consideration. The Committee also has concerns about the operation of the agency itself and points to the recent report of the Commonwealth Ombudsman, which when considering the client base of the Agency had the largest proportion of complaints and the third largest in terms of absolute numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee received a total of 1,031 submissions, including 89 confidential submissions. Submissions were received from a large number of individuals, people who had been both directly and indirectly involved in the proceedings of the Family Court, as well as from lawyers, academics, government departments and authorities, and community groups. The published submissions are contained in 32 volumes, amounting to some 6,000 pages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of the inquiry the Committee took public evidence in all capital cities as well as two regional centres. The Committee also visited several registries of the Family Court and the Noble Park Family Mediation Centre. Evidence was taken from 22 government organisations, 38 non-government organisations and 52 individuals in the course of 17 public hearings and five in-camera hearings. In all, the Committee met formally on 57 occasions for 192 hours, or the equivalent of five working weeks, taking evidence, undertaking inspections and discussions and formulating its report. These statistics give a real perspective on the scope of the task and the commitment this Committee gave to the completion of its task. They of course do not take account of the countless hours of informal inter-committee discussion, dialogue and representation. The Committee was obliged because of the workload involved to seek an extension of our reporting date, which had been established to be the first sitting day in August. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Family Law Act, when it was passed in 1975, was considered to be a watershed in the reform of law relating to the dissolution of marriages, particularly the abolition of the notion of fault and the introduction of a 12 months separation ground for divorce. Now, 17 years on, areas of major concern appear to be the ancillary matters relating to children and property, as opposed to the principal relief matter of divorce. It is with those ancillary matters that the major dissatisfaction with the Act and with the Family Court appears to be focused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee found that as a general rule the Act itself was an effective vehicle for the administration of family law matters in Australia. Generally speaking, the Committee also found that the Family Court was not using the powers granted to it under the Act to the extent possible, nor was the Court making the best use of the flexibility of the Act. In particular, the Committee cites the introduction of new penalties for the enforcement of court orders which the Court has not yet begun to use to their best effect. The cross-vesting legislation, which allows the Family Court to hear a range of matters normally dealt with by other jurisdictions, similarly has not been made use of to the extent that it is possible under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee notes that the Family Law Act has been amended 34 times since the Act was initially passed in 1975. The Act has now become unwieldy, and the Committee considers that it is time for the Act to be renumbered for ease of reference. The Committee has recommended that this happen as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee received a number of submissions from people complaining about aspects of their experience with the Family Court where their complaints may possibly have been of sufficient seriousness to warrant some kind of independent investigation. The anomaly exists that complaints about the operation of the Family Law Court, including complaints about the Chief Justice, are in the first instance made to the Court itself. In this situation, it is difficult for the Court to be an independent arbitrator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee notes that the administration of the Family Court does not come within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. The Committee feels that scrutiny by the Commonwealth Ombudsman is an effective feedback mechanism for government departments, as well the Parliament. The Committee in urging the Commonwealth Government and the Family Court to introduce a complaints handling mechanism for the Family Court suggests that the Ombudsman's Office may be the most appropriate agency to handle such complaints. If this is not the case, then some kind of alternative complaints handling mechanism should be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to counselling, mediation and marriage guidance, the Family Law Act 1975 gives legislative recognition to the pivotal role that the provision of free, in-house counselling might play in assisting separating couples to reach their own decisions, without recourse to expensive litigation. The overriding emphasis in the new Act was to be on the reduction of bitterness associated with marital breakdown. Submissions to the Committee were mixed in their assessment of the value and effectiveness of the counselling service as it currently operates, although the vast majority of submissions were supportive of counselling per se. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The counselling service has a difficult task, which is compounded by the fact that not enough people are aware of the service prior to their approach to the Family Court to initiate proceedings for divorce. At this point many people may have already made the decision to divorce and the counselling service's role will be limited to minimising the bitterness too often associated with divorce and assisting the partners to come to an agreed position regarding their separation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is concerned that the counselling service has not been able to operate as effectively as it might, nor has it been able to offer the range of services possible under the Family Law Act. Research has shown that early intervention counselling is the most successful and to that end it must be possible for people to access counselling services within and outside the court at the earliest opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst counselling can assist in dealing with the effects of separation and divorce, and to some extent minimising the amount of litigation, the avoidance of litigation altogether is desirable. To this end, the Committee considered the role of mediation as a method of alternative dispute resolution within the area of family law. The Family Court has conducted a pilot mediation study and early results are encouraging. Such alternative dispute resolution methods must be encouraged and supported by government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of marriage guidance was another related issue. The Committee encourages the greater availability of marriage guidance and, prior to that, to see relationship education and `life skills' become part of the school curriculum, particularly in high schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of children, by far the most important issues considered by the Committee related to the resolution of disputes in which children were involved. Disputes were usually about who had custody of the children and what access arrangements were going to be put in place for the non-custodial parent. It was put to the Committee that more joint custody or shared parenting arrangements should be adopted. However, the Committee, while it is supportive of arrangements which facilitate the involvement of both parents in the upbringing of their children, was not able to recommend that joint custody be ordered more frequently than it is at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Children need to have security and stability, particularly in the period following parental separation and divorce. Joint custody, where parents have daily care and control of the children for substantially equal periods of time, may not be conducive to perceptions of security and stability. There is nothing in the legislation at present to prevent shared parenting if parents want to enter into such an arrangement. Joint custody requires cooperation and communication between the parents and probably a reasonably close physical location of the two residences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if a shared parenting arrangement is undertaken, it is likely there will be one primary residence for the child or children. However, this is not to say that parents cannot have a significant involvement with and contribution to the upbringing of their children. This must be encouraged, but quite often it will only be achieved if both parents are able to come to terms with their divorced and separated situation and they must be able to communicate with one another regarding their children. I draw the attention of the Senate particularly to comments contained at paragraphs 5.31 and 5.32 of this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One deficiency in the Family Law Act is that nowhere does it spell out the different rights and responsibilities relating to both guardianship and custody. This deficiency has been the cause of some confusion and the Committee has recommended that the rights and responsibilities of guardianship vis-a-vis custody be spelt out in the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An issue raised by many people during the inquiry involved the situation where one parent, usually the custodial parent, moved away from the area, either interstate or intrastate. Many non-custodial parents argued that access to their children following their removal was hindered or prevented altogether. The Committee appreciates the financial and other difficulties which may be involved in the exercise of access rights when the parents live a long distance away from one another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee takes the view that, in general, it is fair to expect that the custodial parent who moves a long distance away from the non-custodial parent should be required to contribute to the costs and travelling involved in access. However, the Committee notes that there may be cases in which it may be inappropriate to require the custodial parent to expend an equal share of the costs and time involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A disturbing matter for the Committee was where there were allegations of child abuse, particularly sexual abuse. Submissions made to the Committee provide evidence of widespread concern about the capacity of the Family Court to deal with custody and access cases when allegations of child sexual abuse are current. If the allegation is malicious, the accused party will be prevented wrongfully from having contact with the children. If the allegation is factual and the result of a real concern on the part of the other parent, then the children must be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major concern is that cases often hinge on conflicting evidence and the veracity of either party's evidence is difficult to substantiate in the absence of a criminal conviction. The manner in which allegations are investigated by State government departments, and the manner in which children are questioned, may affect the reliability of the evidence that is obtained and evidence can be frequently called into question. As it is often nearly impossible to assess the facts with absolute certainty, judges often feel that they have no option but to make a tentative finding, precluding or limiting access to children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is aware that allegations of child sexual abuse and any resulting cancellation or limitations of access may have disastrous consequences for totally innocent parties. At the same time, poor handling of investigations can exacerbate the difficulties intrinsic in this type of case, with the result that the level of danger to the child is not fully appreciated by the court, and the child is returned to an abusive situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another significant issue is whether children should be represented separately in proceedings in the Family Court and whether that separate representation should be ordered in all contested custody cases. The Committee concluded that children should always be separately represented in cases where there were allegations of child sexual abuse and in other cases at the discretion of the court. The Court has developed protocols with the States to better manage cases where there are allegations of child sexual abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the matter of domestic violence, a number of submissions to the inquiry have suggested that there is a need for changes to the manner in which some judges of the court, and magistrates with family law jurisdiction, approach the resolution of disputes over children in cases where domestic violence is involved. Some submissions have argued that the courts have not, in the past, paid enough attention to the effects of violence on children, and have therefore granted access in some cases where it is not appropriate. Others have suggested that, in some cases, the terms of access orders made by the Family Court have conflicted with the terms of protection orders issued by magistrates' courts to protect one party, usually the custodial mother, from further violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has noted that improved coordination between the Family Court and magistrates' courts may help to alleviate existing problems. The Committee also suggests that where police protection is necessary or where a custodial parent fears violence taking place when access occurs then it may well be inappropriate for an access order to exist at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The enforcement of Family Court orders, particularly access orders, is the focus of a great deal of anguish, concern and anger to many people. The Committee received several hundred submissions and hundreds of letters not only from parties to divorce but also from their friends, relatives and children, all complaining about the lack of action taken by the Family Court to penalise custodial parents who breach access orders or agreements. Many submissions expressed outrage at the fact that, while default on a maintenance order is immediately penalised and enforcement action taken, enforcement of access orders is almost non-existent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee heard from many parents, mainly fathers, who claimed that they were being unreasonably denied legitimate access to their children. The Committee also heard from custodial mothers who claimed that they had breached access orders because they feared a violent former partner, and could no longer tolerate persistent harassment from their ex-partner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is concerned that many people have highlighted the Family Court's inability or lack of will to enforce access orders. The flouting of court ordered access is not only a breach of the law;  it can also irrevocably damage the relationship between parent and child. The Family Court must recognise that the new penalties provided in the legislation could be appropriately and effectively used so that children are not denied contact with their non-custodial parent through selfish or vindictive acts on the part of the custodial parent. If access is refused or frustrated, the Committee considers that reversing the onus of proof is a just and proper course of action. It is then up to the custodial parents to justify the refusal and explain why they breached the law. This penal action would assist non-custodial parents to preserve contact with their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to property disputes. The Committee considered the mechanism by which the Family Court currently determines the settlement of property disputes and has made recommendations which seek to make such settlements fairer. In particular, the Committee has recommended that there be equity of sharing&mdash;that is, a 50 : 50 starting point in the division of marital property and any variation from this starting point to be dependent on specific circumstances. The Committee also considered in detail the issue of pre-nuptial contracts or financial agreements. We concluded that where two people wished to make such an agreement, the court must take that agreement into consideration in the division of property, provided that the agreement was not made under duress and was not in any way challengeable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subject of family farms was considered by the Committee. The Committee had a significant number of representations made to it by people who had lost all or part of their farm following a property settlement. In some cases, people affected were not even parties to the divorce. The forced selling of a farm not only requires the seller to accept the market price at the time, but also often takes away the livelihood of the operator of the farm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has recommended that in such situations special consideration be given to farming properties, whether the property was acquired after marriage or whether it had been brought into the marriage by one party, and the necessity to retain the property as an income producing entity. The Committee notes that pre-nuptial contracts may be one way of ensuring the continuation of the farm within the family. The Committee recognises that there are other family businesses to which the above principle may apply, but we received insufficient evidence to formulate specific proposals in relation to other situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inclusion of superannuation as a matter to be taken into consideration in the determination of a property settlement has been a vexing question in family law for some time. Superannuation has been dealt with inconsistently over the years. The Committee recognises that the inclusion of superannuation as part of the pool of property for division has some difficulties, given that it is a benefit which will be realised at a date in the future, and that the determination of the value of superannuation to each party is a matter of some complexity. Nevertheless, the Committee has recommended that superannuation entitlements be included as property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final issue in relation to property settlements is that of the position of de facto couples and the absence of jurisdiction in the Family Court to decide property disputes between such couples. The present situation is one of confusion and varies depending on the State in which a couple resides. Some States have legislation and some do not. Quite often it is the woman who is disadvantaged in a de facto situation where the partners separate. The Committee has recommended that the Commonwealth Government seek a reference of powers from the States in relation to the jurisdiction of de facto property disputes and then legislate so that such disputes be heard in the Family Court. We have specifically recommended that the Family Law Act not be amended in respect of de facto property disputes where children are not involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With relation to the adversarial nature of proceedings, many submissions to the Committee commented on the nature of proceedings in the Family Court and whether such an arena was the appropriate forum in which to hear disputes about relationships. The Committee comments on the formalised nature of the proceedings in the Family Court and notes that the increased and increasing formality is at odds with the spirit and intention of the legislators when the Act was passed in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is aware that an appearance or attendance at court can be an intimidating experience for many people, and that the court may not be the most appropriate forum for many of those to resolve what are, for the most part, emotional and personal problems. It is evident that there is added emotion in family law disputes, particularly where those disputes involve children. This being the case, it was necessary to consider whether alternative mechanisms or procedures are better suited than a strictly adversarial legal process to the resolution of family law disputes. The Committee concluded that, even though there have been criticisms of the adversarial system and that it may not be the ideal method for resolving family law disputes, the adversary system should be retained but with appropriate modifications for alternate dispute resolution and simplified procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal now with the costs of proceedings. The Committee is concerned about the effect that increasing costs are having upon access to justice in family law matters. A matter of fundamental principle is the accessibility and availability of professional services at an affordable cost for people approaching family breakdown or following any separation of parties. The Committee is concerned that there should be a balance between the cost of services of the legal profession and the availability of those services to the community. The Committee notes that 521 submissions made a reference to the high cost of being involved in family law disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee hopes that recommendations made by it and moves already afoot in the Family Court will simplify procedures and thereby reduce costs anyway. The Committee has recommended the development of a new costing system and the greater use of costs orders, particularly where it is apparent that one party has unnecessarily prolonged proceedings. Complaints about limited access to the court because of high legal costs and the problems encountered by self-represented litigants were made to the Committee. The court must strive to make itself more user-friendly and enable those parties who wish to represent themselves to do so adequately. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some comments on this report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operations and Interpretation of the Family Law Act. This is an important document presented to the Senate this afternoon. Of course, it is with some sadness that we bring the report to the Senate at a time when many families in our community are under much greater pressure than the normal pressure of keeping a family together, when we have well over one million people out of work&mdash;one million families affected by the consequence of unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, it is worse than that, when one understands the number of families affected by perhaps one parent being out of work when both have worked previously, and the one out of work in that circumstance not being counted; and when one thinks of the number of people who are in part time employment who would, in fact, prefer full time work. We are talking about families at a time when there is particular pressure. We are talking about families at a time when there are 680,000 children living in families without a breadwinner. Hopefully, these are circumstances that will change before too long and that additional pressure will be removed from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is inevitable that the stress of these facts will be very significant indeed. Some families may even be drawn together by the circumstances, but far more may well find that it is the thing that causes the fracture to come in the end and that the family will not survive, with the inevitable consequences, both for the children of the marriage and for the parties themselves whose hopes have been dashed. The one thing that the Committee had in mind throughout this inquiry was that the institution of marriage is something that is very important in our society. Honourable senators may think that is not apparent from the report because it dealt with the consequences of breakdown of marriage. But I believe that throughout the inquiry the institution of marriage was foremost in our minds as we dealt with the issues before the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We gave great consideration to the things which perhaps make it easier in the end to keep a marriage together: learning to understand each other; teaching life skills at an early age. I think we would be particularly conscious of those young people who have grown up in a situation where a functioning marriage has not existed. They will inevitably find it more difficult to enter a marriage and make it work because they have not had the example of a good, functioning family. It is particularly important that, somewhere in society, we enable people to learn the skills that are necessary to keep personal relationships in a wholesome way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to concentrate more on prevention of breakdown of relationships, even though we recognise that, when a relationship has broken down, it is important to have in place mechanisms to enable people to restructure their lives as quickly as possible with as little bitterness as possible. It is inevitable that when a marriage breaks down there is great hurt&mdash;always for at least one party but, in my experience, frequently for both parties. That hurt does not go away easily or quickly. Those are the issues that brought this inquiry about. This must be a day of particular satisfaction for Senator Brownhill who worked so hard for so long to have this inquiry set up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us, as senators&mdash;and, I suspect, members of the other place&mdash;have had representations over the years from constituents who have been hurt by their experience as a consequence of the breakdown of their marriage. They come to us and seek assistance. I think every senator and member would know of the issues that came before the Committee. We considered 1,031 submissions, 89 of which were confidential. Many of them were in the form of letters, and were no less valid submissions for being so. In many cases, the hand-written letters were far more impressive because carried within them were the real feelings of the person who wanted to be heard. In many of the submissions that is what people were seeking; they wanted to be heard. They felt that they had not been heard previously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are dealing with an Act of Parliament which affects more people in our country than any Act other than the income tax Act, so its significance is great. Approximately one in three marriages is ending in divorce. The solutions to dealing with those problems need to be looked at. The Act that we were reviewing came into existence in 1975. Although under the previous Act there was a ground for divorce which enabled people to dissolve their marriage without establishing fault after living apart for five years, with the new Act fault was eliminated from the legislation&mdash;but not from the minds of men and women who had embarked upon marriage in the first place. Although we can legislate to say that fault is no longer relevant, it is not as simple as that when we come to dealing with the people who are concerned with it. As a consequence, some of the other issues&mdash;such as custody, property, access and payment of maintenance&mdash;have become more significant than they were under the old Act when the grounds for divorce were frequently the centrepiece. That is what we are still dealing with 17 years after the event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people have suggested that we should return to the old Act. I do not think that would really change or improve anything. We have to deal with the consequence of the breakdown of marriage. In doing so, we have to recognise that solutions are not easily found. We were given evidence that about 95 per cent of marriages which break down are settled between the parties, and the very best settlement is the one that the parties reach themselves. About 5 per cent go to litigation&mdash;a quite small percentage one might say, but significant nonetheless. We have to be careful that, in dealing with those who are unhappy with the consequence of all this, we do not set up arrangements which make life more difficult for the 95 per cent who in fact work out the solutions for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we appreciate that, amongst the 95 per cent, there are some who reach settlement but who are not happy with the consequences of it. It gets back to dealing with the hurt that comes from the breakdown of the marriage and enabling there to be sufficient counselling for people to be able to work it through and get on with their lives. That is the crucial thing. What really are the priorities of what we are talking about? I think that we are talking about the children of the marriage, first and foremost. I am not forgetting the adults, but I think it is the children who are least able to deal with the situation. I always feel a tinge of sadness when I hear a parent say, `The kids are fine. They understand. They know. They are all right'. I wonder whether in fact that is the reality or whether it just appears that way, because the impact on children is enormous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We discussed this from a number of points of view. We spoke about the adequacy of counselling&mdash;not just for the future of the children but right from the beginning. If only we could get people to recognise the symptoms of trouble in the marriage early enough to obtain marriage counselling, from the Family Court, a marriage counselling service&mdash;anywhere. They would recognise the symptoms early if it were a tooth. Why not when it comes to the most precious relationship? We need education&mdash;and we referred to this&mdash;to encourage people to accept the necessity of obtaining advice, help and assistance at an early stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view that there is no-one on earth to whom one should be more polite and more considerate than one's spouse&mdash;the most precious person in one's relationships. But somehow we tend to forget this from time to time. Counselling is necessary from an early stage, and also when it is recognised that the marriage has failed, in order to try to get rid of the bitterness, to try to get the parties to understand what has occurred&mdash;why one party has left or why it has happened as it has. It is absolutely vital to do as much as possible to avoid a defended divorce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded of the woman who came from Albury to give evidence. She told us the story of the breakdown of her marriage, including the court proceedings and everything that went on. I said to her at one stage, `Would it not be the fact that you were married to somebody who wanted his day in court, no matter what?'. Some people are confronted with that situation: the other party will pursue the matter, is not amenable to counselling, is not amenable to mediation; the matter must go to court because that is the only way it can finally be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We talked about the need for people to be able to have separate interviews at counselling&mdash;especially where domestic violence has been involved&mdash;and the special sensitivity that is required in that situation. We talked about the need for an interpreter service so that one can be quite sure that those whose English is not up to it are able to get advice and assistance in a way that is meaningful to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went to a mediation centre and looked very closely at mediation. It has been introduced; I believe that it is working well. I believe that it has a great deal to offer&mdash;not for everybody, but if it helps some it is an achievement. We suggest that in this particular skill there should be a diploma set up in each State so that people can study and become expert in this area. At the present time I do not believe that there are sufficient people skilled in mediation for it to become as widespread in the community as we would want it to be. Some people will not go to mediation; some people will go but will not participate. We know that, but we do believe that it is highly probable, especially where we have two people who deep down want the matter resolved, that they will be able to talk through their problems and come to a solution with mediation. But it gets back to counselling, mediation, marriage guidance and being prepared to deal with the problems in one's relationship in a meaningful way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Access to children, of course, became one of the big and central issues. I particularly recall the grandparents that we saw. I hope that we can find solutions that will enable grandparents to be accepted as having a really meaningful role to play in the lives of their grandchildren. We heard some stories which were really quite pathetic and ought not to occur. But it is something that flows from the consequence of people being so deeply hurt that they want to get back at somebody in some way. They might not really mean it, but that is what they want to achieve at that time. As a consequence, I think the hurt to the grandchildren is great. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McKiernan referred to the separate representation of children, especially when there has been abuse. It is not my view that all children should be represented in divorce proceedings. I think it is wrong to conclude that the parents do not have the best interests of their children at heart. Of course there is a case for separate representation, but we should not intrude that first; we should let the parents work out a solution. Frequently, there can be significant problems between the parents as adults, but in many cases they are able to come to reasonable decisions as far as their children are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard, frequently, about the costs of divorce&mdash;and I do not really need to go into that here. I think everybody would be aware of the fact that it is a pretty costly procedure to get involved in. Some cannot afford to get involved in it. There is legal aid available but on a fairly limited basis. I do not know that granting more legal aid is the answer to the problem, but we did make some comments about the influence that aid might have&mdash;the influence that flows from one person having assets as a result of which one might be totally bankrupted in the end by proceedings being drawn out and going on for a very long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We looked at some of the procedures of the Court and came to the view that simplification is required and is necessary. I believe that the Court is aware of that as well. It is in the process, together with solicitors involved in the area, of working towards simplifying procedures. The Court, we believe, should have regard to the impact of costs on proceedings. It should be sensitive to the costs which flow from regulations and procedures that are put in place. So when we are planning on a new procedure, we should think first, `What will the impact of this be on the cost of a divorce?'. It should not be looked at just solely from the perspective of convenience or the administration of the Court; it should also be looked at from the point of view of the litigants and what effect it will have on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we heard a great deal about domestic violence&mdash;far too much. Domestic violence is not new. It has been around for a very long time. Many honourable senators will remember the ground of `cruelty' that existed under the Act which this Act replaced. Nothing much has changed in that area, but I hope that we are more aware of it now as a community and regard it as totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There definitely was a feeling conveyed to us that judges do not really understand domestic violence. I am not able to say whether that is a fair conclusion or not. I can only say to you, Mr Deputy President, that witnesses conveyed to us on occasions that they felt that judges did not understand domestic violence. It is an area where counsellors and judges need to be sensitive to what is happening in the community. I have used the word `sensitive' a number of times as I have spoken this afternoon because I believe that that is perhaps one of the words that is relevant to this whole area of human beings&mdash;being sensitive to each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what came out of the submissions and the many letters that I referred to, handwritten letters, was the enormous sense of frustration that people suffered as a consequence of their encounter with the Family Law Act&mdash;the system, the Court, the judge, the counsellor, the lawyer, somebody. We were not a court of appeal and in no case did we ever set ourselves up to be one. We took all of these submissions as they came to us on the basis that we accept that `You have had an unhappy experience; we want to try to find, as a consequence, the solutions to those problems'. Of course, from time to time there are faults with all of those things: the system, the Court, the judge, the counsellor, the lawyer&mdash;we recognise that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many conflicting messages came through from all of this: the woman who feels aggrieved because she has been abandoned with the children and is not being paid maintenance, not getting a fair settlement and not being able to get on with her life; the man who feels he has done nothing wrong but has lost everything&mdash;his house and his children&mdash;and is paying maintenance. It is not simple to bring all these things together and find one solution. The situation is one where that is just not possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we have to try to work through this situation and see that overall the Family Law Act is doing what people expect of it&mdash;it is enabling them to get before the Court, if that has to happen; enabling them to see counsellors when that is necessary; enabling them to get appointments without having to wait too long; and enabling them to get appointments with a counsellor without having to travel too far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area of access, though, is where many of the frustrations come after the marriage has been dissolved. There needs to be some fairness in relation to the costs of access where parents are living away from each other. There was talk about where children should be handed over if one of the spouses rightly fears violence. We rejected the idea of children being handed over at police stations, unless very special arrangements have been made. I think I would personally totally reject handing children over at a police station. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We looked at the situation which develops quite frequently of allegations of repetitive court actions or repetitive counselling appointments made in relation to access over little things; and of people who make appointments and do not keep them or people who are advised of appointments and do not keep them. There are so many ways of aggravating the other person. We have to deal with that of course, but what really needs to be dealt with is the underlying problem that makes a person want to continue to hurt the other party. We heard about false accusations in relation to a man having access to his children. I would deal with that most severely if it were ever found to be true. But, then again, sometimes it happens, so we cannot ignore the consequences of that either. We have recommended that the Attorney-General ask the Family Law Council to inquire into the incidence of allegations of false accusations and make a report on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have asked that the police have more access to the information about court orders so that enforcement can be more meaningful if a domestic violence order is breached. At the present time, we all know stories and have all had constituents come to us complaining about not being able effectively to enforce an order. We have dealt specifically with the ways in which we think that that should be dealt with in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee discussed the question of the terminology used in relation to custody of children&mdash;custody, guardianship, joint parenting, and all of these things. My personal view is that we perhaps should abandon the use of the word `custody'. We should make custody the fact of parenting: once a child is born, those two parents are the custodial parents of it, and that that cannot be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why I think that should be explored is that the word `custody' has some meaning within it&mdash;that is, being in custody at a police station and so on. It has within it a meaning that implies ownership and control in a way that I do not think is really meant in this Act. We have not recommended any changes at this stage, but I think we should look at it with a view to making orders for the future arrangements for children more understandable and meaningful to the two parties involved. This will cover where the children will live and what involvement is meant by guardianship. People had so many different views of what they thought the orders meant. There is confusion in the minds of many people about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have dealt with property and recommended more precisely defining the matters to be considered. We rejected any suggestion of a set formula. It was put to us that there should be a formula that is followed which makes property precise. I reject that as a proposition, because in the end that would cause more inequities and problems than the ones we are trying to solve. I understand why it seems a simple solution, but I reject it. However, we have suggested that more things should be taken into account when determining property so that there is less uncertainty than there seems to be at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We suggest that financial agreements between parties should be both recognised and enforceable, and we particularly deal with the special case of farming properties. Superannuation is a matter of great importance in this community and we recommend that the court have power to divide superannuation and that it be regarded as property. We recommend that the court have power, under an amendment to the Act, to direct the trustees as to what should happen. It is my view that every woman should have a superannuation scheme whether she is in employment or not. When superannuation is to be divided, it may not be fair or reasonable to set off superannuation that is due in 20-odd years against the house now. Perhaps that super should be divided between the two of them and put into a scheme for each which will mature and into which someone will continue to pay. We have dealt with that and made recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the Child Support Agency which raised its head constantly throughout our inquiry and in the submissions. I have spoken in this place frequently about the Child Support Agency. There are problems with the formula and with the way it is administered. That has been set out by the Ombudsman recently and I shall not go through those details now. But it is vital that the Child Support Act be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are creating a situation where men are abandoning their employment to avoid being absolutely bankrupted by the application of the Act. There are women who are having great difficulty surviving because their money is not being paid to them promptly, and they then suffer the consequence of the former husband giving up his employment altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are examples of men being absolutely unable to get on with their lives and re-establish a household because of what they have to pay under this formula. Sometimes a woman is in employment and perhaps living with a person who is earning a good income. All honourable senators present know the stories I am talking about because they have heard them in their electorate offices. We were not looking into the Child Support Agency, but we have commented on it in chapter 16; one could not complete this report without doing so. I hope our remarks will be read and taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were asked to comment on whether the rules governing publication should be changed. At present any proceedings can be published and reported upon without identifying the parties. If the media is serious about educating and informing by the reporting of proceedings, they can do so now. The only reason why names need to be added is if the media want to sensationalise the issue. I totally reject the need for the names to be a reason for reporting Family Court proceedings. There are cases when a judge may order the names to be announced when they involve snatched children and things of that nature. That of course happens, but otherwise I see no reason to change it. We suggest and recommend that the Act be renumbered. It is very complex to use as it is, and I hope that will be done very soon indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise that many of the recommendations are quite costly. We suggested&mdash;and in fact this is now under way&mdash;that there be a review of the funding. Is the Family Court funded adequately to carry out the functions which this Parliament has said it must carry out? If we have passed legislation which says the court should do this, that or something else, we should ask whether we are funding it adequately. It is not just a luxury. On the other hand, it is very expensive and, in the end, perhaps we are asking taxpayers, who are busy making their marriages work, to dig deeper and deeper to fund the court. It is not easy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We felt that we could not conclude this report without a review of the costs of the court and how it is spending the $110m that it is already getting. Is this sum adequate, and are there ways of making changes which will enable it to function easier and with less cost to taxpayers? Would it be cheaper in a sense to have more money spent on it so that it can be more effective than it is at present?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In nearly half an hour that is a very brief resume of this report and the inquiry which we have undertaken. I have not touched on a number of matters which I would like to have dealt with this afternoon. I hope people will read the report and that the Government will look at it very closely indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a report which we have all agreed upon and that is of some significance. One might say that it is always tempting to put in a minority report and get the additional publicity that flows from that process. But all members of the Committee were very aware indeed of how important our inquiry is to so many people in this community. Some may not feel happy with what we have concluded, but I hope they will see a number of things in it that are worthwhile. We certainly have not adopted every proposition that was put to us, but we looked very closely at them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, but by no means least, I am grateful for the opportunity of working with Robina Mills, David Wallace, Fiona Taylor and Lesley Cowan who worked with the Committee during the last part of it. Early on we worked with a number of people, and I am thinking particularly of Jon Stanhope, who left to be Deputy Administrator on Norfolk Island. All those people were dedicated to the task, but in particular the four people I have mentioned have been invaluable. I have enjoyed working with them and have benefited greatly from the opportunity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a great deal of pride that I am able to speak on the tabling of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act. It is the  report of an inquiry which I was told repeatedly could not and should not be done and would not be possible. I thank those who supported my quest for an inquiry, encouraged me along the way and urged me to continue to battle for them and on their behalf.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, to the extent that this inquiry was viewed by some with unrealistic optimism, we have not solved the dilemma facing 40,000 Australian families every year or answered the question, `Why do marriages fail?', and we have not provided a formula to prevent couples from seeking a divorce. The biblical intonation `What God has joined, let no man rend asunder' is no more or less achievable today than it ever was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to recognise that the increase in the divorce rate is as much a reflection of people's changing attitudes and expectations of what is possible in life and the ability to work hard at a marriage as anything inherently wrong in the system or society. If we start from that basis, then objective examination of the Family Law Act is possible, as it was in the case of this Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking to the report, it is impossible to deal in any depth with all 16 chapters, so I will contain my remarks to those areas which prompted me to seek the inquiry in the first instance. Accordingly, my concerns will largely centre on chapters 5, 6, 7 and 11. My initial concern was with the apparent inequity and inconsistency in matters of custody, access, maintenance and property settlement. I believe those aspects of the Act have been all well examined in this report and the recommendations outlined will make a meaningful contribution to the family law debate in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of child support and the Child Support Agency was not a term of reference for this inquiry, although I wanted it included. To most people grappling with divorce, it is all part of the one problem. However, in the strictest legislative terms, child support does not come under the auspices of the Family Law Act. Therefore, we refrained from making any recommendations on this issue. Senator McKiernan has already outlined how frequently this vexed question was raised. I urge the Government to seriously examine its operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McKiernan has also covered the important role that counselling services play. I support the recommendations of strengthening that service. However, I am of the view that, unless separating couples are convinced of the benefits of counselling, the influence counselling has on future relationships between the divorced parents is limited. For that reason, I believe it is important that more appropriate guidelines be put in place so that the judges and solicitors have firmer guidelines to determine the merit of the opposing arguments, irrespective of the quality or quantity of counselling available. It is imperative that consistent guidelines be laid down for assessing custody and access arrangements and determining an equitable split of marital property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so far as the report talks about custody, many submissions suggested that the Family Court was not the appropriate place to determine custody problems. I would disagree with that assertion, but accept that decisions about custody need to be made by those in full possession of all relevant issues. There are too many submissions to quote in any detail, but it appeared to me that too often custody orders were made without the judge satisfying himself fully of all the facts that needed to be taken into consideration. We heard too many stories of unsuitable parents being granted custody to suggest that it is an aberration. A more informed judge could avoid many of these inappropriate decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, too many divorcing parents have no real understanding of their rights and obligations. A submission quoted in the report is typical of those we received. The second paragraph on page 99 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My ex wife has sole custody of our children because I was not advised by my solicitor what the difference was regarding sole and joint custody [guardianship]. The solicitors fixed this up amongst themselves. I feel now that my rights as a parent have been stripped from me . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The recommendations we make on these will help reduce that lack of informed judgment. Access, or lack of it, is probably the single most contentious aspect of divorce. It is the subject of most of the submissions the Committee received and certainly it forms the overwhelming bulk of family law related letters my office receives. The law sets out quite clearly that access should be available to the non-custodial parent and, in theory, no-one would dispute that. In practice, it is not always that easy, as the Committee learnt. What happens if one parent moves thousands of kilometres from the other? What happens if access is only offered at a time when the non-custodial parent cannot have the child? What assurances can be provided that the child will be safe? How does one handle the resentment and jealousy that might arise between the two parents?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well to say that people must be objective and adult, but when it comes to wanting the best for your child it seems that rationality is often lacking. The court has battled with the problem for years with mixed success. The notion of joint custody is fine, provided both parents are sufficiently objective to allow it to work. Not everyone can be or wants to be objective and cooperative for a whole variety of reasons. The Committee recognised the difficulties that joint custody brought with it and, indeed, the Family Court itself advised us of research that suggests that joint custody should be provided only in cases where both parents were capable of assuming parental responsibilities, where there was a demonstrated willingness to cooperate, where it was geographically possible, and where there was an absence of parental conflict. It acknowledged that joint custody did not work when parents could not cooperate or communicate with each other or where they were actively litigating for sole custody of their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report has also taken on board the practicalities of access. It recognises that there is often a cost involved in getting a child from one parent to the other. As the law presently stands, it is assumed, but not specified, that the non-custodial parent pays for the access visit, and if he or she cannot then either a mutual agreement is worked out or the child misses out. I think the most appropriate recommendation is recommendation 43 which directs the Family Court to give recognition to fairness and the capacity of the custodial parent to share the costs and the travelling time involved in the exercise of access and, where appropriate, make each parent contribute to the costs. The cost of access is often a prohibiter and has been used by both custodial and non-custodial parent alike as a barrier to access. If the court can provide some direction on this, it will remove some of the acrimony in some access disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recurring objection was that of the continual obstruction of the custodial parent in denying access and the inability of the court to bring the defaulting party to order. Again, the report suggests that the Family Law Council extend its present inquiry to examine the extent to which the access orders are breached, what and how penalties are presently imposed, and how effective they are in correcting the problem. Many submissions talked of continually denied access despite court orders. Providing specific access arrangements add to the frustration in making the custodial parent cooperate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While penalties are written into the Act, it seemed to the Committee that they were rarely applied. We are suggesting that the Chief Justice of the Family Court instruct his judges to apply them. I hold the view that if there is a possibility that the penalties will be applied many defaulting parents would become more cooperative. Most of the time, access is denied because of sheer spite and resentment. I think that the fact the Act has operated since 1975 is evidence that the counselling and advising about right and proper behaviour has not been sufficient incentive in some cases for parents to adhere to the spirit of the law and it is past time to start applying the penalty clauses a little more rigidly. I think, if that were tried, we well may find less violence will result. Often, the tragic cases we hear about are a result of frustration and resentment over denial of access to children. The law is only as strong as its application and there is evidence that it could be more uniformly applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another pivotal aspect of the divorce process is how best to split the assets of marriage. No matter how fair one might like to be, the fact remains that one $500,000 house is obviously more luxurious than a $250,000 one. The reality of divorce is for many a reduction in living standards. That cannot be avoided. Equity is more difficult to achieve. To what extent should the custodial parent receive more than the non-custodial parent? Much resentment surrounds this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Property involves not just that accumulated during the marriage but that accumulated by both parties prior to the marriage. While under the Australian marriage law each spouse retains what property they might have owned prior to their marriage, in practice that does not always follow. The courts have a capacity under section 79 of the Act to alter the property interests of the parties to a marriage. To what extent property ought to be divided is no simple formula. What is meant by equality or sharing? Who determines it and how is it determined? Section 79 of the present Act sets out a number of issues that need to be taken into consideration, but their interpretation has been the cause of considerable litigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all this comes the vexed questions of maintenance, child support, the financial capacity of both parties and the contributions of both parties. Many submissions related to difficulties arising between working and non-working parties. Because the Act does not clearly direct what weight a judge ought to place on each of these various considerations, there have been varying interpretations and determinations made over the years with discrepancies becoming more evident and some people believing they have not received a fair go from the court. This seems particularly the case with custodial versus non-custodial parents and evidence has shown some discrimination against the non-custodial party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, because this has been a grey area, too many times it seems that the cost of litigation to determine a fairer property settlement has resulted in more money being given to the solicitors than the value of the property in dispute. That can happen if one party vexatiously decides to keep taking the other party to court. The Committee acknowledges that section 75 and section 79 of the Act do not give sufficient direction to judges. It has suggested that the Act be amended to instruct judges to combine relevant matters when determining property settlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an argument to suggest that the fifty-fifty marriage asset split is today more equitable in that the custodial parents receive considerable financial support through child support arrangements. This is a view strongly put by the Lone Fathers Association. The National Women's Consultative Council also asked for less discretionary powers and supported the notion of equal shares. The Family Court was at pains to point out that 95 per cent of all property arrangements are settled outside the court and that litigation affects only 5 per cent of cases. However, one cannot assume that the 95 per cent of cases settled outside are always either amicable or fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our recommendations take those views on board. We support equality of sharing as the starting point in the allocation of property and that, where they exist, pre-nuptial or subsequent financial agreements should be the starting point but that the courts should have the discretionary powers to vary from the principle of equal sharing based on the length of marriage, future needs, financial impact and other similar considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my perspective, rural property was the pivotal point of this whole review in terms of how the Family Court regards the treatment of family farms in determining property settlements. Numerous cases brought to my attention involve farms being sold up and non-custodial male farmers losing not only their home but also their source of income to accommodate the requirement that a property split be done between the two parties. I have never subscribed to the view that a divorce ought to result in someone losing his or her home, job and livelihood. In my view, any law that supports that notion is clearly wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am in disagreement with the Family Court judges who, in the past, have seen nothing wrong with destroying a family farming operation. Their judgments have been counter to the notion of equity and law. Neither do I accept, as was suggested to the Committee, that the court attempts as far as it can to alleviate the sorts of problems associated with farms and businesses. I have too many examples highlighting this problem contained in letters in my office. Indeed, one such case started my relentless campaign to have this inquiry started. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far too many totally unfair and inappropriate judgments affecting family farms need to be addressed. A submission in the report reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have recently been involved in a divorce and property settlement, which I believe I was unfairly and unjustly treated, I was ordered to pay in excess of $600,000.00. This amount was arrived at by way of percentage of property value. Property which had been gifted to me by my father only three years prior to separation.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased that the Committee came to a similar view and recognised that family farms need to be considered differently in determining property settlements in marriage breakdown. I am delighted that we have done so and I trust that the legislation is soon amended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recommend that the Act be amended to distinguish farming properties from other matrimonial property so that the court takes into consideration such matters as how the farming property was brought into the marriage and the necessity to retain the property as an income producing unit. Frankly, if this Committee achieved nothing other than these changes, I would be satisfied that it had not been entirely without purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolution of property disputes has frequently been linked with maintenance. As I have already said, the operation of the Child Support Agency was outside our terms of reference. However, that did not prevent many submissions being received that dealt with this vexed issue. Indeed, 198 submissions detailed complaints about the level of child support payable, and more than 70 complaints were directly aimed at the Child Support Agency. Complaints have continued to pour in both to the Committee and to the offices of myself and others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that maintenance and child support are inextricably linked, the Committee could not ignore them. Generally, the complaints centred on the formula base, the inability of many non-custodial parents to start a second family because of the financial obligations placed on them by the CSA to their first family and the overwhelming amount of resentment that the whole process generated. In some cases, it has forced people to abandon employment to avoid their financial commitments. It has restricted increased access to avoid breaching the formula for shared custody and it has resulted in less access because the non-custodial parent cannot afford it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, there has been no provision for custodial parents contributing below an income of nearly $30,000. We were told that some non-custodial parents are taking a lesser property settlement, usually outside the court process, to avoid expensive legal fees and on the assumption that their financial obligations would be reduced. That frequently was not the case, and the Child Support Agency made no recognition of the property settlement arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that point, I expressed concern at evidence the Committee took last week from a representative of the Child Support Agency. In response to my questioning on what consideration the Child Support Agency gives to the changed circumstances of custodial parents, the gentleman concerned responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is entirely irrelevant. It has nothing to do with the maintenance of the children of the previous relationship.</PARA>
<PARA>That attitude concerns me and clearly fuels resentment to an already very emotional issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to raise two other issues only briefly, although that in no way implies their lack of importance. The first is the very disturbing issue of costs. This issue is dealt with at length in chapter 14 of the report. Increasing costs are affecting the ability of people to obtain justice through the Family Court system. Surely that is contrary to the spirit and intent of the Act. We have suggested a number of issues relevant to this subject. Too often it was suggested that the only winners in divorce were the solicitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Figures of $400,000 or $250,000 were given in various witnesses' evidence, and these were not large property settlements of millionaires. Those costs will never be recouped. In those cases, there seemed obvious grounds for the litigants to complain. Perhaps in other cases it was simply a matter of a client refusing to accept the advice offered and wanting to continue the litigation. The incidents reported to the Committee suggest that the legal profession needs to take a long, hard look at its charging procedures for family law. There is a great deal of room for improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that I wish to raise briefly&mdash;again, it is one that Senator McKiernan has already mentioned&mdash;is our recommendation that the powers of the Commonwealth Ombudsman be extended to examine decisions of the Family Court which, until now, have been outside his jurisdiction, notwithstanding the fact that many people have taken that course of appeal. The Committee is of the view that it is an important countercheck on the Family Court and, as such, ought to be available to those who do not believe they have been fairly treated. Additionally, the Family Court could do well to examine its complaints handling mechanisms and see whether these might not be improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw my comments to a close, although there are so many other aspects that I want to comment on. I thank the Committee Chairman for his cooperation and the manner in which he treated this entire reference. That we have achieved consensus on so many issues is of great personal satisfaction. I also wish to be associated with the Chairman's remark as to the heavy burdens placed on the Committee secretariat, which has not had an easy job processing so many submissions and dealing with so many people, who understandably hold very strong and emotional views on this topic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate staff have been similarly very heavily involved in this issue now for several years. My personal thanks go to my electorate secretary, Mrs Toni Rogers, for the work that she has done for me and for the many other members and senators' officers in handling family law queries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the beginning, no amount of legislation or review will ever remove entirely the bitterness, acrimony and sadness surrounding marriage break-up. This report hopefully takes the process of divorce a little closer to one of equity. As legislators, that is all that we can hope to achieve. I said when I moved for the establishment of this inquiry that we were setting out on a daunting task but that the rewards would be many. I believe that if this report is taken by the judiciary and all the people who have any association with family law, it will have achieved in no small measure a great deal to help people in those sad and emotional times. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to have the opportunity to add some comments to those already made on the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act. Unfortunately, I was not able to hear all the remarks of Senator Reid and Senator Brownhill. I did hear most of what Senator McKiernan said. I am fairly sure that I could concur with most of their comments. In particular, I would like to thank my colleagues on this Committee. Sometimes there is a clear division of opinion on committees but things worked out agreeably. Sometimes things become fairly divisive but in this Committee there was a unanimity of purpose and a remarkable ability for all members of the Committee to produce this almost unanimous report, with two very small dissents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to thank the very hard-working staff. I am sure the Senate has already been told that we received over 1,000 submissions. The work required to sift through the opening round of letters and submissions to this inquiry was a massive task. It did not lessen as the inquiry proceeded because the interest in the Family Law Act and this inquiry persists. The Committee was tagged by many of those people in the community who had a lively interest in the deliberations of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are just a few points that I would like to highlight in my comments. The people who contacted me before this inquiry started, and certainly the people who led me at one stage to try to seek a reference to the counselling service of the Family Court through the Standing Committee on Community Affairs&mdash;more particularly women&mdash;were concerned about the consequences of the Family Court on marriage breakdown associated with domestic violence. Most people would know of some of the tragedies that have occurred within the Family Court where men and women&mdash;husband and wife&mdash;were required to attend together and have not in the past had adequate protection, even within the precincts of the court. On a few occasions very serious harm has been done to some women attending the court and on a few occasions I think there has been actual death. Those things no longer pertain and the Family Court has realised the importance of providing adequate security to those people attending the court. The counselling service should recognise that sometimes it is inappropriate for couples to attend together, particularly where the question of domestic violence is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard Senator Tate in this place on a number of occasions point to the importance of the court protection orders actually being effected as well as being effective. As in the responsibility for who does what within the court precincts, there has been a period when the protection of citizens under the Family Court protection orders has fallen between Commonwealth and State jurisdictions. It has taken quite some time for those matters to be sorted out so that women who are victims of domestic violence and involved in Family Court proceedings can now expect a better understanding by the court of their needs for protection, both during the counselling and court procedures and subsequently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No matter how well we might recommend changes under the counselling procedures in the Family Court here, it is also true that women continue to be harassed by unhappy spouses. I certainly put on record in this place and can say it again that there are still women who are murdered in this country as a result of domestic violence. Nearly 50 per cent of the murders in this country each year are domestic violence related. It is a matter of the greatest gravity that the Family Court, in looking at the very unhappy breakdown of some marriages, take account of those facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other points I want to make&mdash;I have raised it in this place on a few occasions previously&mdash;relates to the importance of Family Court judges being up-to-date with community standards and having a recognition and understanding of what is the state of play in the real world. Sometimes it has been clear that some of the comments of Family Court judges would have us believe that they are not up-to-date with community standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this report we recommend that it is important for the Family Court to have a more systematic and intensive program of judicial education in relevant non-legal matters, particularly in factors such as domestic violence and child abuse, which can influence the welfare of the child. I would also hope that that could be read without necessarily requiring the welfare of the child to be of prior consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In matters such as domestic violence, the welfare of a woman is equally deserving of the court's consideration. In making this recommendation we appreciate that sometimes Family Court judges are not completely up to date with what are community standards. It is not acceptable for women in our society to be victims of domestic violence. It is not acceptable for women from one State to another to be harassed or hounded across our nation. This is what happens to many women. It is very unacceptable that women who have left a violent marriage to try to make a new start and provide adequate care and support for their children should find themselves harassed and hounded across the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent proposals for portability of protection orders go a long way towards the courts, governments and parliaments recognising that it is not okay for women to be victims of violence and to be harassed across the country. At the same time it is also quite clear that we cannot guarantee protection to women who have come out of a domestically violent marriage. We cannot give a guarantee after a divorce or after a woman's leaving a violent marriage. We need to address ways in which portable protection orders can be provided to the necessary police forces or magistrates courts in the places to which a woman might move. We need to ensure that protection in fact exists rather than being set out on a piece of paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the recent agreements between Attorneys-General it is proposed that the issuing of a protection order will allow police immediately to seize all guns belonging to the person against whom the protection order is issued. These steps are a beginning to protect women who are the victims of domestic violence. Certainly, the changes reflect the very considerable move in this Parliament, in government and in society to recognise that domestic violence does exist and to determine exactly what constitutes such violence. I am very pleased that we have addressed that in this report on the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have addressed all the bits and pieces of the consequences of the administration of the Family Law Act. In particular, we have pointed to the importance of counselling being provided early. It should be provided in a way that takes account of the particular circumstances of any family&mdash;that is, if there is a domestic violence situation, couples are not required to attend counselling at the same time; or, if joint counselling is agreed to, adequate protection must be guaranteed to the woman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report we also talk about the importance of mediation as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism. Mediation may not be the preferred or appropriate way to deal with a situation involving domestic violence. Mediation often works best if both parties to the marriage breakdown can attend. That, of course, may not be possible if the spouse who is a victim of violence cannot be guaranteed protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recognising the time constraints, I will not trawl over many of the things that I would like to say about this very comprehensive report which will be an excellent addition to the Family Law Act and its implementation. In particular, the chapters on the role and effectiveness of counselling, mediation and marriage guidance deserve very serious deliberation and consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think every member of the Committee recognised the importance of marriage guidance. The report proposes that even school-age children, and in particular secondary school children, be given access to early education on communications and relationship skills. If this is done, it is hoped that in the longer term there will be less marriage breakdown due to the failure to address the resolution of difficulties. The breakdown of some marriages is evidence that lots of people in our society lack these basic communication skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area that deserves consideration is the enforcement of Family Court orders. I have talked about protection orders. Until recently, and possibly even still, in some jurisdictions protection orders are not satisfactorily or adequately enforced. As well as that, much evidence was given to the Committee about the failure to enforce access orders. There is a concern that the penalties and sanctions under the Family Law Act are not being used to require the implementation of court orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We even talk about consideration of the reverse onus of proof against a person who fails to meet an access order. Orders are made to require a person to provide access. It is therefore argued in this report that it is up to the person who fails to satisfy that order to justify or come up with a reasonable excuse why that person was unable or unwilling to fulfil it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of chapters in the report deal with matters concerning property. I simply draw attention to the fact that we did look very extensively at property issues. I have to say that it is now something like a mere 100 years since women won the right under English law to have some claim on their own children. Up until the 1880s women in Britain had no claim of access to their children. As with all property in a marriage, children belonged to the man. Over this century we have seen a breaking down of those laws and a recognition of the rights of women to have access to their children, to parental responsibilities and to property. This report highlights that, by and large, a property settlement following the breakdown of a marriage would start off with a fifty-fifty split. That is an extraordinary move&mdash;even when compared with what happened 25 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a huge number of submissions and complaints relating to the child support scheme. This area was not part of our terms of reference. But we could not properly ignore the number of submissions. So we wrote a chapter on the problems relating to the child support scheme. This may be something that the Government will want to take up; it may be something that will lead to a further examination. This is a very constructive, thoughtful and comprehensive report. I am very happy to support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act which was tabled this afternoon by Senator McKiernan, the Chairman of the Committee. The Committee had its beginnings in a motion moved some time ago by Senator Brownhill in response to many representations that he had received from constituents asking for just such an inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must admit that at first I thought this was likely to be a waste of time. It is a matter of public record that the family law area has been surveyed, investigated, researched  and reported on many times. As a result, there have been countless reports and perhaps not as much action as one would wish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought that it might have been quicker if I approached the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and submitted a range of reforms that the Australian Democrats thought should be implemented as a matter of urgency. When it became obvious after three months that the Attorney-General was unable to proceed with most of those requests for reforms, the Democrats decided that we would support Senator Brownhill's motion for a select committee, and the Committee started work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry turned out to be a substantial undertaking indeed. It received more than 1000 submissions. Public hearings were held in all States, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. Some 120 recommendations are the outcome of this report. Many of them are not directed to the dissolution of marriage but to the maintenance of marriage, to attempts to achieve reconciliation and to offer as much support as possible to people going through this most traumatic human experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee worked well under the sensitive yet goal-directed chairmanship of Senator McKiernan, with quite superb and expert support from the secretariat and, in particular, its Secretary, Robina Mills, the legal adviser, David Wallace, the senior research officer, Fiona Taylor, and the very able administrator, Lesley Cowan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My satisfaction with the results of the report is somewhat tempered by the realisation that the law is necessarily a very blunt and, in the end, inadequate instrument to assist people in this most traumatic area of human experience. Another aspect that I found rather unsatisfactory during the process of this inquiry was that many of the 1,000-plus witnesses recounted personal problems, personal anguish and personal trauma and asked the Committee to assist them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not easy to withstand those requests. Very obviously, it was not our task, it was not within the ambit of our activity, and we had neither the resources nor the avenues open to us to assist with individual difficulties. Nonetheless, I think all members of the Committee would have experienced considerable anguish&mdash;`anguish' is not too strong a word&mdash;when we faced these personal experiences. I think that to a large extent it informed our determination to do the best we could in this difficult area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That aside, the results of the Committee were a lot better than I expected could be achieved. I agree with the Committee's report and recommendations. They are a very significant step forward in the continuing effort to improve the provisions and the implementation of the Family Law Act. Nevertheless, a number of matters require stronger action. I will refer to the three points which formed the subject of my dissent a little later tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the largest areas in which I believe positive progress was made is in the assessment of the Family Court counselling service and the recommendations arising from that. There was very clear agreement that increased resources were necessary to meet the demand in this area. In particular, Committee members felt that it was necessary to reduce waiting times, to make sure that after hours services were available, that visiting services to outlying areas could be provided and that additional resources could be provided to cope with the additional caseload due to references from States regarding ex-nuptial children and other areas of counselling, such as grief counselling, post decision and post settlement counselling, which the Committee thought were essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Committee recommended that filing and sub-registries be established in a number of regional centres other than those currently in existence. This includes a new registry for Geelong. The Committee also felt that continued and ongoing training was necessary for councillors, particularly&mdash;and previous speakers have mentioned this&mdash;in the areas of domestic violence and child sexual abuse. The Committee found differing levels of understanding and expertise in the various courts around the country. I was also pleased to see that the Committee considered that an interpreter service for the Family Court was essential and must be provided free of charge. For people who are in a strange country, with a language they do not speak, to have to go through this emotional experience without being able to communicate in their own tongue would be an additional burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to some other matters related to the Family Court counselling service. I note with satisfaction that the Committee recommends the promotion of complementary community based counselling services and mediation services coupled with a determined push to increase community education in the community and in schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the most difficult area is custody and access. There was some suggestion at the beginning of the inquiry that we could achieve a cultural change in the attitudes prevalent in this area if we turned away from the term `custody', which somehow conjures up an image of imprisonment and control, and perhaps went to more neutral terms&mdash;something like `joint parenting', or `parenting plans'. In the end, after receiving considerable evidence on this question, the Committee decided that this was not a good way to go at this time, that we were dealing not so much with terminology but with substance, and that we needed to ensure that as far as possible this area was administered in any improved manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also addressed itself to the question of separate representation of children and noted that this is provided in the Act. Under section 65, the Family Court is given power to order separate representation `in any proceedings under the Family Law Act in which the welfare of a child is relevant'. The discretionary nature of this provision and the absence of easy access to legal advice for children do not satisfy either the general principle that all human beings are autonomous individuals regardless of age or the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Australia is a signatory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effective operation of section 65 is limited in two ways. Firstly, the court exercises its discretion to appoint a separate legal representative somewhat infrequently, and by definition only when it has become obvious that the welfare of the child could be affected unless this step was taken. Secondly, the number of cases actually coming before the court is small compared with the total number of marriage dissolutions involving children. More than half&mdash;55.6 per cent&mdash;of all divorces granted in 1990 involved children. However, approximately 95 per cent of all divorces do not reach the stage of proceedings before the Family Court. Hence, in most divorces, decisions affecting children are made by agreement between the separating parties in circumstances which do not enable the court to use its discretion under section 65. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if such an agreement were to be registered with the Family Court, the court is not obliged to examine the terms of the agreement. Only 380 such agreements were registered in 1990. The court cannot assess the effect on the former partners or on their children of the agreements and their contents. The opportunity for emotional blackmail to achieve, for example, a favourable property settlement, trading off access or custody provisions, is obvious. Indeed, the Committee has been provided with some anecdotal evidence to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The underlying assumption in such cases is clear: the children are chattels and may be treated as such. Separate representation for all children involved in family law proceedings has been recently introduced in New Zealand. The operation of the scheme is awaiting analysis, although the Committee was offered informal and anecdotal evidence that the cost to the legal system was substantial. The cost factor will indeed require careful consideration, but where the welfare of children is at issue it should not be a bar to the implementation of an appropriate scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In practical terms, and to a large extent in legal terms, children are under the control of adults in a family or household which is intact. This is often used to rebut arguments in favour of separate legal representation for children. However, the need to protect the welfare of children, even in so-called normal settings, is on the public record, not least in the growing acknowledgment of domestic violence in families across all socioeconomic strata. The loss of security and the emotional upheaval of a marriage dissolution lends particular urgency to the need for separate legal representation. However, the principle of greater personal autonomy, enunciated in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the Child, has general application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To meet these requirements, I added the following recommendations to the report: firstly, in all cases involving access, custody or property disputes, where the contestants have care and control of children, a separate legal representative for the children be provided by the court; secondly, that ready access to legal advice be made available through community legal centres or other agencies funded by the Commonwealth Government for children who are in the care and control of persons undertaking marriage dissolution proceedings; and, thirdly, that the Registrar of the Family Court be given the responsibility to ensure that all children involved in a marriage dissolution be informed that such a service is available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of custody, the Committee recommended that custodial parents share the costs of travel&mdash;often long distances&mdash;for non-custodial parents as a result of changes in the domestic arrangements of their former partner. That was one of the areas on which the Committee received considerable representations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area that provided a lot of heartache was the difficulty that some non-custodial parents experienced when seeking to visit their children under the access arrangements and found, either intentionally or by accident, that this had become impossible. Attention is drawn in the report to the summary enforcement option available in such cases. The report also notes that early intervention counselling should be instituted on a much broader scale where such access problems are expected to ensure that some early action is taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division of property has notoriously been an area of difficulty in marriage dissolution. The Committee has recommended that an equal sharing of property be the starting point where an agreement is not in existence and that where an agreement exists that agreement should be the starting point. However, considerable discretion has been left with the court. In exceptional circumstances, the court may pay attention to the length of the marriage, the care and control of children, obligations that one of the former partners has under the child support legislation, the future needs of each former spouse, the financial impact on each former spouse, the property brought into the marriage, the home-making and child rearing contribution made during the marriage and the financial contribution made during the marriage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other notoriously difficult area that the Committee addressed was the area of superannuation. The Committee recommended that superannuation be considered a property asset and be taken into account on the basis of the notional realisable value at the time of the hearing and that this asset be shared between the former partners at the discretion of the court in proportion to the length of marriage or co-habitation by reference to the total period of contribution to the superannuation fund. Whether a trustee can be directed to divide the asset in this way remains to be decided and presents some legal difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of property disputes de facto couples have  so far been disadvantaged. The Family Court has jurisdiction over de facto couples when they separate if children are present. However, where there are no children, the Family Court has no jurisdiction over property disputes. The inadequacy of State law in this area is notorious, and the Committee recommended that separate legislation be passed&mdash;separate from the Family Law Act, that is&mdash;to give the court jurisdiction over property disputes of separating de facto couples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this area, the definition for a de facto couple refers to a partnership between a man and a woman. I have added the recommendation that this should be extended to de facto gay couples since I am of the view that there is no reason why these couples should not be helped in a similar way. It has been acknowledged in the report that the Family Court's addressing this particular matter would in no way detract from the basic premise, which is enunciated in the Family Law Act, that marriage, as a social institution, must be supported and protected. However, it is quite clear that we must take account of social realities: that the number of de facto unions in our society is increasing and that these people, as well as legally married couples in the traditional sense, should have access to the legal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An area that has been difficult in the past, and continues to be problematical, is the area of farming properties. Very clearly, a farming property usually represents the major asset in a marriage and there is the desire&mdash;in fact, the need&mdash;to retain the farm as an intact and viable income producing unit. At the same time, the Act requires that the assets be divided. The court has addressed this matter by raising a number of exceptions to that rule and offering a number of avenues in which this could be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found it a matter of regret that, due to the absence before the Committee of specific evidence, the Committee could not address the matter of the small business&mdash;that is, a non-farming business; say, the corner grocer store&mdash;which in many cases may well be the only asset of the couple. But I trust that in time this matter will be addressed in a similar way to the consideration given to farming properties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has recommended that financial agreements made between prospective partners or agreements made during the currency of a marriage be given higher status. In particular, it has been recommended that such agreements should contain a list of assets that each of the partners brings to the marriage and that they should make provision for variation. The Committee also recommends that the court retain a residual discretion to deal with changing circumstances. That is a very worthwhile move since it could well be said that an agreement made in the first flush of a new marriage may not receive the same hard-headed consideration that the making of a commercial contract might receive and that partners, unwittingly or willingly, might disadvantage themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also recommends that mediation be given a much greater role in the area of counselling, arbitration and settling of marriage disputes. But it would be true to say that the Committee, at this stage, has not seen fit to push this to the stage where mediation is offered as a direct alternative to the court process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to see that self representation and the facilities to be offered for people seeking to represent themselves form part of the report, and that an officer of the court is to be appointed in each court to make relevant advice available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I wish to advert briefly to the fact that the Committee has sought and received agreement to extend the inquiry to deal with the administration and funding of the Family Court. Under the terms of reference that the Committee had it was not possible to address this in any depth. Very clearly, the recommendations made by the Committee would not have a lot of substance unless one addressed the perennial questions:  where is the money coming from, and how much is required?  I am very glad that this step was taken, and look forward to the continuing work of the Committee on this question and its report that will be brought down in February. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">INTERIM REPORT ON THE INQUIRY INTO THE CONDUCT OF THE 1990 ELECTION, PART II AND PREPARATIONS FOR THE NEXT FEDERAL ELECTION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>Mr President,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report I have just tabled addresses part of the Committee's current inquiry into the conduct of the 1990 Election Part II, and preparations for the next federal election. The issues covered in the interim report are expected to come before the Senate this week. Accordingly the Committee decided to provide the Parliament with its views before proposed changes become part of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reporting on the conduct of the 1990 federal election the Committee was critical of the time taken to finalise the House of Representatives result&mdash;which was not known until four days after the election. The Committee made several recommendations aimed at speeding the House of Representatives result, including better access for scrutineers to monitor the preferences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In responding to this recommendation the Australian Electoral Commission has proposed a provisional two-candidate preferred distribution to be conducted by polling officials in each polling place on election night.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senators will recall that a Bill for an Act to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 was introduced in the Senate on 15 October 1992. Clause 22 of the Bill deals with the scrutiny of votes in House of Representatives elections. An addition to section 274 of the Principal Act is proposed to provide for "a scrutiny of such preferences (other than first preferences), on such of the ballot-papers, as are required by the direction; . . . " This allows for the provisional two candidate preferred distribution, if so directed by the Australian electoral officer for the State or Territory. No details are provided in the Bill regarding how this is to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Details on the new election night procedure were provided in three submissions from the Australian Electoral Commission. Certain aspects of the procedures caused some concern, including proposals for transmitting the result, the process of identifying the candidates to receive provisional preferences and access for scrutineers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to transmitting the House of Representatives results, the AEC's preferred position was to hold the results of the primary count until the two-candidate preferred result was available. The two results were to be transmitted at the same time to the national tally room, thereby providing an earlier and more accurate result than could be achieved using previous procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While welcoming the promise of a more accurate result on polling night, the Committee could see no reason for creating a "nexus" between the primary vote result and the two-candidate preferred result. This topic was explored at length in two public hearings during which the Committee took evidence from AEC officials regarding the arguments for creating the "nexus". The Committee was not convinced that there was any good reason for holding back the results of the primary count&mdash;in fact there is an expectation from the public and candidates that results will be broadcast as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has made six recommendations in this interim report, covering procedures for identifying the two candidates for the provisional distribution, counting and transmitting the vote, access for scrutineers and liaison with the media.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee wishes to thank the Australian Electoral Commission officers for their advice on the technicalities of the election night system and for their willingness to consider the Committee's concerns in relation to the planned procedures. The Committee believes that the recommendations in this interim report will provide a more accurate result than in previous years, and will satisfy the needs of the public and candidates in the most timely and efficient way.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the mysteries of Australia's constitutional history is the number of anomalies gathered along the way. There are provisions in the constitution which are widely agreed to be expired, or even silly, and about which nothing substantive has been done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph (iv) of section 44 is a case in point.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 44 as a whole deals with "disqualification". That is, it prescribes that certain persons, or classes of persons, "shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting" as a member of this place or the other place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among the curious grab-bag of circumstances listed in section 44 is paragraph (iv). In effect, this paragraph disqualifies people from being a candidate for election if they hold an "office of profit under the Crown.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the provision operates to prevent a person holding two jobs at one time, with the public purse paying for both, it also operates to remove a fundamental right&mdash;the right to be a candidate&mdash;from an enormous number of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Time and time again Parliamentary committees and constitutional commissions have reported that this provision should have been changed, and have even prepared draft legislation for this purpose. Yet nothing has been done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The answer probably is that to this point there hasn't really seemed all that much of a pressing need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sure, the provision is wrong in principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sure, it inconveniences a fair number of school teachers or police officers or clerks or public sector engineers who want to stand for election&mdash;but until recently ways have been found for ameliorating the worst effects, and in any case the "victims" hadn't complained too loudly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now we have the Cleary case to focus our attention on this matter. More significantly, in terms of practical politics, if the High Court confirms Mr Cleary's ineligibility we will also have had the Cleary case to focus the community's attention on this very silly provision of the constitution. And we ourselves will then look silly if we are seen to continue to fiddle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This, clearly, is a time for us to act together. It seems from report after report that we are all of the same view on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill I am presenting is substantially based on that recommended by the Constitutional Commission in Appendix K of its Final Report in 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">None of us can claim to have uniquely identified either the problem or the sensible solution set out in the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We can, all of us, join in saying that the doubt and uncertainty&mdash;not to mention the potential disruption, cost and inconvenience&mdash;of the Cleary case has got us to agree on one thing at least. This is that the piece of silliness acknowledged by common consent to be enshrined in paragraph 44(iv) of the Constitution will now by this Bill be put behind us.</PARA>

<PARA>The Referendum (Goods and Services Tax) Bill 1992 provides for a referendum to be held at the time of the next Federal election. Voters would be asked a simple question:  do you agree to the introduction in Australia of a goods and services tax?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 6 November the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, told the House of Representatives that if the coalition wins the election Labor would pass legislation imposing a GST. On 9 November Mr Keating said that Labor wants the coming Federal election to be `a referendum on the GST'. Well, Mr Keating, here it is: a Bill to hold a referendum on the GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill aims to make it as hard as possible for the Prime Minister to manipulate voters into casting their election ballot on one issue. It also makes it as hard as possible for a harsh and punitive goods and services tax to be imposed on the Australian people. A GST referendum would allow the election to be decided on the big issues: the state of the economy, society, unemployment and the environment. With a million Australians unemployed, a huge and growing foreign debt and an industrial base that is small and ecologically unsustainable, it is a perversion of democracy to focus on a solitary tax measure, large and unfair though it is. Mr Keating knows full well that if the coalition wins the election, it will do so in spite of the GST. This week's Newspoll showed that only 28 per cent of Australians support a GST&mdash;some mandate!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that whichever party wins government, it will do so with well under 50 per cent of the popular vote in the House of Representatives and less than 40 per cent in the Senate. That party will have a mandate to run government. It can expect to have its Supply and Appropriation Bills passed, but every other piece of legislation will have to run the gauntlet of parliamentary scrutiny. This includes tax Bills which, contrary to popular belief, are not Supply Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent history is littered with examples of Labor and coalition oppositions voting against tax Bills announced as Budget measures. In 1981, Mr Keating joined his colleagues in the Opposition and voted against sales tax legislation to force the Fraser Government to exempt necessities of life. After the 1985 Budget, the coalition voted against the capital gains tax, the fringe benefits tax and the ending of tax deductions on entertainment expenses. There is no parliamentary convention or constitutional restriction which requires Parliament to pass tax Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only honourable pretext on which Mr Keating could vote for a GST in opposition would be if this referendum were passed by a majority of Australians. Otherwise his pledge to pass a GST will be seen for what it is&mdash;a sell-out of Labor voters and a cynical attempt to win government by coercion. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a couple of remarks to make in respect of what Senator Coulter has just said. In my view, the question that he suggests be put by way of referendum to the Australian people&mdash;that is, `Do you want a GST implemented in Australia?'&mdash;indicates what some less kind people than I might refer to as the stupidity of the Democrats. Why do we not put the simple question: `Do you want more of the same?' It is just about as telling to the Australian people as the simple question, `Do you want a GST?'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question `Do you want more of the same?' connotes all the things that I would want to indicate to the Australian people that this Labor Government has brought about: one million people unemployed and a recession we did not have to have which, all of a sudden, became the recession we had to have. All those sorts of things are conveyed in the emotive question `Do you want more of the same?' Similarly, the question `Do you want a GST?' conveys the message `Do you want another tax?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, you and I know&mdash;and it is probably in the forefront of your mind, if not the deepest depths of your heart&mdash;that that is not the question that is being put to the Australian people at the next election. It is not simply a question of whether they want a GST. It is a question of whether they want a GST if they also get personal income tax cuts, a disposal of the petrol excise, a disposal of the training guarantee levy, a disposal of customs duty, a disposal of lump sum tax on superannuation, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that should be put to the Australian people is not, `Do you want a GST?' but, `Do you want a GST if, in exchange for it, you can get some things and get rid of some other things?'. In other words, it is an overly simplistic question which would mislead the Australian public. That is not the mandate that my Party is seeking or is going to seek from the Australian people at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not be saying to the Australian public, `Do you want a GST at all costs?'&mdash;come what may, willy-nilly. We have put before the Australian public a plan which we have chosen to call Fightback&mdash;fight back against the decay, the million unemployed people, the hopeless situation presented by this Government. It is true that Fightback includes a GST, but it also includes a number of other very positive things. It is a plus and minus sort of package where members of the Australian public will choose, on balance, which they would prefer&mdash;more of the same or a package such as the one that we propose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to take much time because I know there is pressure on the Senate at the moment. The question proposed by the Democrats does not in fact portray the whole question that will be put to the Australian people by virtue of going to the polls at the next election. The second point I make&mdash;and it just happens to be Senator Coulter to whom these remarks need to be made&mdash;is that Senator Coulter has tonight committed a sin, or what I would regard as a sin, that the Democrats frequently commit. Senator Coulter has said, `Do not think for one minute that if the coalition is elected at the next election it will have a mandate to implement the policies it wants'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a somewhat breathtaking remark from the Democrats. He says, `Do not think that because someone has put a broad plan before the Australian people they are entitled to seek the implementation of that plan&mdash;not at all'. Senator Coulter has made a mathematical calculation which indicates&mdash;and, incidentally, it is quite right&mdash;that a party can get a majority of the seats without having a majority of the votes. He basically says that, therefore, the system stinks and we should not rely on the system of gaining seats in the lower House. The system that allows a party to get a majority of the seats in the lower House does not require it to have a majority of votes. He says that, therefore, we should not accept that as being a mandate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, one can question the role of the Democrats in this chamber; one can say to them, `For every seat you have, you have to get only 14-odd per cent of the vote'. Why should we, the major parties, which gain a much bigger proportion of the vote, allow them&mdash;how ever many of them are left at the death knell of their Party, or that which calls itself a party&mdash;to hold the balance of power over what will or will not happen in this country? The Democrats then say, `Do not be silly. That is the way we vote. That is the way one gets elected to the Senate. That is how the system works. Therefore, we are entitled to expect to exercise that power'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am trying to make is that the Democrats cannot criticise the system by saying, `I know you meant to get a majority of seats but because you do not need a majority of votes to get a majority of seats, we do not approve' and then, in the next breath, without even turning face, say that in this place, which is an integral part of the system&mdash;it works together; it is not a case of the House of Representatives down there and the Senate up here and never the two shall meet; we are all part of one system&mdash;with the limited proportion of votes that they get they should be able to decide what will happen with the whole nation.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES' REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill proposes amendments to the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 to implement more recommendations of the 1991 Brown Review of the Comcare program. The Review made a number of recommendations designed to improve the effectiveness of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has decided to implement the recommendations of the Brown Review in stages. Honourable Senators will recall that the first step in implementing those recommendations was the restructuring of the Commission as a regulatory body distinct from its service delivery arm, Comcare. The Commission is now responsible for regulatory functions under the Act, such as the setting of premiums, while Comcare is responsible for the commercial administrative and service functions under the Act, and provides administrative support to the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those changes were made by the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Act (No.3) 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further changes to implement the recommendations of the Brown Review were made by the Commonwealth Employment (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1992. These amendments altered the status of AOTC Limited and Australia Post from administering authorities to licensed authorities under the Act and improved Comcare's financial arrangements. The effects of these changes were to make AOTC Limited and Australia Post more accountable to the Commission for their operations under the Act, and to establish a system of regulation by the Commission to ensure greater consistency of practice between Comcare and the licensed authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AOTC Limited and Australia Post were deemed to have been granted a Class 3 Licence on the commencement of the new arrangements for a period of twelve months. To date, they are the only licence holders under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the amendments to the Act which would be made by this Bill would build on the changes that have already been made to the Commonwealth Workers' Compensation Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main purpose of the Bill before you is to allow the Act to extend to certain corporations outside the Commonwealth Public Sector. The Government has adopted this course so that former Commonwealth Authorities, such as the combined Qantas/ Australian Airlines, which have been or are about to be privatised, can choose to remain covered by Commonwealth legislation. So that these former Commonwealth Authorities are not advantaged by their access to the scheme, the Bill will also allow the Act to apply to those private sector corporations which are in competition with a privatised Commonwealth Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For very similar reasons, the Government has decided to extend the option of cover under the Act to private sector corporations which are in competition with any Commonwealth Authority, regardless of whether the authority has been, or is to be, privatised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To reflect the widened ambit of the Act, its title will be changed to the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will result in corporations which may be granted cover under the Act having access to a nationwide workers' compensation scheme. The Government believes that this will further the progress of micro-economic reform and lead to greater efficiencies by reducing the administrative burdens on corporations which currently have to operate in several workers' compensation jurisdictions around the country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cover under the Commonwealth scheme will be optional for those corporations which are eligible. No privatised Commonwealth Authority or private sector corporation will be required to take up cover under the Act. Each corporation will make a decision based on its own commercial judgement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes will effectively implement the second part of Recommendation 13 of the Brown Review that Comcare should be able to cover fully privatised former Commonwealth Authorities. Recommendation 13 also proposed that Comcare should be allowed to manage claims in jurisdictions other than the Commonwealth. However, the Government has decided to allow the Act to extend only to private sector corporations which are in competition with a Commonwealth Authority or a former Commonwealth Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extension of the Act has been discussed with State and Territory Governments, which have been assured that it will not exclude privatised Commonwealth statutory corporations and other private sector corporations from their responsibilities under State and Territory occupational health and safety legislation. Safeguards will be built into the licensing arrangements to ensure these responsibilities are met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth is also concerned to ensure that the extension of the Act does not adversely affect the operations of State and Territory workers' compensation arrangements. This has been the subject of discussion with the States and Territories, and is to receive further consideration through a formal joint Commonwealth and State/Territory Review. It is envisaged that this review will be completed by the end of April 1993. The Act will be implemented only in respect of privatised and continuing Commonwealth Authorities until the review is completed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The licensing arrangements contained in this Bill are similar in many respects to those contained in the Commonwealth Employment (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1992 that applied to Commonwealth Authorities generally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for two classes of licence, a Class "A" licence and a Class "B" licence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Class "A" licence will allow corporations to self-insure. The management of claims by employees of Class "A" licensed corporations will be carried out by a subsidiary of Comcare.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Class "B" licence will allow the corporation to self-insure and to make appropriate arrangements for the management of claims by its employees. Those arrangements may be, for example, claims management by the corporation itself, or by a Comcare subsidiary or by a third party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Bill, the Minister for Industrial Relations must be satisfied that a private sector corporation is in competition with a Commonwealth Authority or former Commonwealth Authority before it can be considered for a licence. The actual decision whether a corporation should be granted a licence, and the nature of any conditions that may be attached to the licence, will be for the Commission to make.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both classes of licence will require a corporation to self-insure. It will be a condition of each licence, therefore, that the corporation will obtain bank or other guarantees to ensure that the corporation's liabilities will be met. In addition, the Commission will need to be satisfied before granting a licence that satisfactory arrangements have been made to ensure that employees of the corporation will continue to receive their entitlements if the corporation is wound up.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before granting a Class "B" licence to a corporation, the Commission will need to be satisfied that the persons who will be performing the claims management function on its behalf are likely to be able to meet the standards imposed by the Commission for the management of claims and the rehabilitation of injured employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Licensed corporations will also be required to comply with any direction of the Commission, either generally or in respect of a particular matter or class of matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission will be able to impose conditions on a corporation's licence which are similar to those which may apply to a Commonwealth Authority. For example, to ensure that employees of licensed corporations receive an independent assessment of their claims, a licence may be subject to a condition that the reconsideration of claims made by a corporation's employees be carried out by employees of the Commonwealth or by a Comcare subsidiary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Licensed corporations and Comcare subsidiaries will be required to determine claims for compensation in the same manner as Comcare. That is, they are to be guided by equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case without regard to technicalities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employees of licensed corporations who are dissatisfied with decisions made in relation to their claims will be able to seek review of those decisions by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in the same way as employees of the Commonwealth. The Bill contains several amendments to Part 6 of the Act to allow this to occur. The respondent in such proceedings will be the licensed corporation. However, Comcare will be entitled to become a party to proceedings involving licensed corporations and, to ensure consistency of representations made to tribunals and the courts, the Commission may direct the corporation not to put certain submissions to a tribunal or the court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, Comcare will not become directly involved in the administration of claims made by employees of licensed corporations. Claims management services provided by Comcare to either Class "A" or Class "B" licence holders will be undertaken by subsidiaries of Comcare. These subsidiaries will have their own board of management and separate accounts, and will be subject to the same taxation and regulatory requirements applying to private sector corporations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comcare subsidiaries will be audited by the Auditor-General.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of Class "B" licensed corporations, Comcare subsidiaries will have to compete with other parties for the right to perform claims management functions. These new arrangements will therefore enhance the competitive environment within which Comcare operates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission will be able to investigate apparent breaches of licence conditions by corporations or their claims administrators. If the Commission is satisfied that a breach has occurred, it may revoke the licence. The Bill deals in detail with the effect of revocation of a licence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Bill contains a number of other amendments which are not related to the licensing of private sector corporations under the Act. These amendments are essentially of a "housekeeping" nature, the need for which has become apparent in the course of the administration of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among other things, the Bill would amend the Act:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to specify the distance to be travelled by claimants before travelling expenses will be reimbursed to claimants seeking medical treatment and the rate per kilometre payable for such journeys;      </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">FINANCIAL IMPACT STATEMENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments proposed in this Bill are not expected to have any significant financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The costs of licensing and regulating corporations will be recovered from those corporations by way of application fees and licence fees. Comcare subsidiaries will be required to operate on a cost recovery basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION) BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this Bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will introduce many of the measures outlined in the Treasurer's `Security in Retirement&mdash;Planning for Tomorrow Today' statement of 30 June 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In that statement the Treasurer outlined how the Government's retirement incomes framework now combines three central tiers. The age pension and social security system interacts with both compulsory and voluntary superannuation arrangements, with the compulsory tier of the Superannuation Guarantee Charge operating largely through the existing tax assisted arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The statement also reaffirmed the Government's commitment, on grounds of equity and social justice, to assist lower income workers to live better in retirement through a combination of the age pension supplemented with tax assisted superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several major initiatives were announced in the statement affecting both the voluntary and compulsory tiers of the superannuation arrangements. These measures will be introduced in this Bill. They will reinforce the existing fundamental features of the Government's retirement incomes policy.  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Rebate and deduction arrangements for personal superannuation contributions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will replace the existing deduction and rebate arrangements for employees who have employer superannuation support with a new rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new rebate will be simpler and directed to low and middle income employees with employer superannuation support. The rebate will be 10% of personal superannuation contributions of up to $1,000 made to a complying superannuation fund. The maximum rebate begins to be phased out when the contributor's assessable income exceeds $27,000, and is unavailable to people whose assessable income is $31,000 or more.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new rebate is not only simpler but also fairer than the previous arrangements. Eligibility for tax concessions is no longer dependant upon the level or type of employer superannuation support received. All taxpayers in equivalent circumstances are treated equally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises that the level of rebate is modest and that some employees will face reduced tax concessions on their member contributions. However, employees will benefit significantly from the other tax concessions provided for superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, rebatable contributions will not be taxed in the superannuation fund. This measure combined with the maintenance of the concessional 15% tax rate on the earnings of superannuation funds will contribute very substantially to the magnitude of end benefits received by employees in retirement. Rebatable contributions will also form part of the contributor's undeducted contributions even though the contributor has received a tax concession for them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the introduction of the SGC has extended access to the superannuation tax concessions to a wide range of employees. The value of these tax concessions will grow in line with increases in the prescribed minimum rate of the SGC. In this context, the cost to the Commonwealth in terms of revenue foregone in 1993-94 as a result of the introduction of the SGC is around $400 million, in contrast with savings of $230 million arising from the changes to the taxation treatment of member contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing deduction arrangements will continue for employees without employer superannuation support and self-employed people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment will apply to payments made on or after 1 July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Limits On Deductions For Superannuation Contributions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will implement proposals to limit the amount of deductions available to an employer or self employed person for contributions to a superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of these amendments is to restrict the amount of superannuation benefits which can be funded in a superannuation fund. These amendments will replace the existing arrangements which restrict funding through the two fund rule and the complex minimum funding standards applying to superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the 1994-95 year, the total amount of deductions available to an employer for contributions to a superannuation fund for the benefit of an employee will be restricted to certain age-based limits. For the 1994-95 year, the limits will be $9,000 for an employee under 35 years of age; $25,000 for an employee between the ages of 35 to 49; and $62,000 for employees aged 50 and over.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, if an employer has ten or more employees at all times during the year of income, the employer may elect to use a standard contribution limit. In such cases, the employer's total deductible superannuation contributions will be limited to the amount calculated by multiplying $25,000 by the least number of employees employed at all times during the year of income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the 1994-95 year, the maximum deduction a self-employed person can make will be the lesser of $3000 plus 75% of the amount over $3000, and the person's age-based limit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The age-based limits and the standard contribution limit will be indexed annually.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures will also apply from 1 July 1994. Combined with the measure relating to Reasonable Benefit Limits they are expected to increase revenue by $20 million in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Reasonable Benefit Limits</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill introduces amendments to transfer responsibility for the administration of the reasonable benefit limits (RBL) from the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to the Commissioner of Taxation from 1 July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also contains measures to simplify the operation of the RBLs. From 1 July 1994 a person's RBL will be a set dollar amount. For the 1994-95 year the set dollar amounts will be $400,000 for the lump sum RBL and $800,000 for the pension RBL. These set dollar amounts will replace the existing complex calculations based on a person's highest average salary. The amounts will be indexed each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Transitional measures will ensure that taxpayers who already have accrued benefits that are within the existing RBL but are in excess of the proposed limits will be able to retain their entitlement (indexed to AWOTE). These transitional measures will be set out in regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill contains a number of other minor RBL simplification measures including the removal of the need to commute the amount of a pension or annuity which exceeds a person's RBL.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures apply from 1 July 1994. Combined with the measures limiting deductions for superannuation contributions they are expected to increase revenue by $20 million in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Taxation treatment of redundancy, early retirement and invalidity payments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the present law, 5% of bona fide redundancy payments, approved early retirement scheme payments and invalidity payments are taxable. There is no limit on the amount of these payments eligible for concessional tax treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will provide a limit on the concessionally taxed amount of bona fide redundancy payments and approved early retirement scheme payments to avoid scope for abuse by people able to manufacture the necessary circumstances. The limits will be $4000, plus $2000 per year of completed service with the employer concerned. These amounts will be indexed in later years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amounts within the limit will be fully exempt from tax. They will be excluded from the definition of eligible termination payment and will not be able to be rolled over. Amounts in excess of the limit will be treated as ordinary ETPs from employers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also exempt the whole of an invalidity payment from taxation. However, invalidity payments will continue to form part an ETP and will be able to be rolled over.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also requires the disability of the recipient of an invalidity payment to be verified by two legally qualified medical practitioners. This measure will prevent the treatment of redundancy and early retirement scheme payments from being abused, while accommodating the vast majority of genuine arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments apply to payments made on or after 1 July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed limit on bona fide redundancy payments and approved early retirement scheme payments will generate an indeterminate but not significant revenue gain. The exemption from tax of amounts within the limit and invalidity payments will cost $20 million in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Rolling over eligible termination payments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the present law taxpayers can elect the amount of each component of their eligible termination payment they want to roll-over. This allows taxpayers who have pre-July 83 service the ability to avoid much of the tax on the post-June 83 components of their eligible termination payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will remove this tax avoidance loophole. Under the new arrangements taxpayers can continue to elect the amount of their undeducted contributions and concessional components they want to roll-over. However a number of steps will need to be followed to identify the extent to which the amounts rolled-over consist of the other components.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of its anti avoidance nature and the ease with which this loophole can be used this measure will apply from 1 July 1992. This measure is expected to result in a small increase to tax revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also amend the income tax law to remove the current 90 day rollover period so that benefits must be rolled-over directly from the source to the destination fund. The new arrangements will substantially reduce the administrative complexities associated with roll overs. They will also help eliminate the scope for abuse that currently exists. Direct roll-overs of benefits will also help to ensure greater amounts remain in the superannuation system by removing the temptation to `fritter' moneys away during the roll-over period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure will apply from 1 July 1994. It is expected to have an insignificant effect on the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Rebate on Superannuation Pensions and Roll-over Annuities</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Annuities and well designed pensions provide a simple, certain retirement benefit. To improve the attractiveness of pensions and annuities the Bill will amend the income tax law to replace the existing complex rebate arrangements with a 15% rebate on superannuation pensions paid from taxed superannuation funds and on annuities purchased wholly with rolled-over eligible termination payments. The flat 15% rebate will mean that no tax will be payable on rebatable superannuation pensions and annuities under approximately $17300 in today's dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rebate will apply to the whole amount of the pension or annuity included in assessable income up to the maximum amount allowed under the reasonable benefit limits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new rebate will apply from 1 July 1994. It is expected to have an indeterminate but not significant cost in the short-term. Longer term costs could be greater if the measure is successful in encouraging greater use of pensions and annuities, with this cost offset by lower age pension outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Undeducted Purchase Price</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also limit the undeducted purchase price of rebatable superannuation pensions and roll-over annuities to the recipient's post-June 1983 undeducted contributions. This will ensure consistent treatment between superannuation pensions and annuities.  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill amends the definition of eligible termination payment so that the unused undeducted purchase price of a commuted pension or roll-over annuity can be rolled-over direct to a roll-over fund or to another pension or annuity benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes will apply from 1 July 1994 and are expected to have an indeterminate effect on the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Pensions and Annuities</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also introduce a definition of pension and annuity into the income tax law to ensure that allocated pensions and allocated annuities receive appropriate tax treatment. This change has no revenue implications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also proposes several amendments to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987. </EMPHASIS>The terms "pension" and "annuity" will be defined in terms of conditions that income payments must meet to be regarded as tax concessional pensions or annuities. Furthermore, complying funds within the meaning of that Act will be restricted to providing benefits meeting those conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Retired people will be given greater freedom of choice in benefit provider by an amendment to allow them to transfer benefits into superannuation funds from other superannuation funds, approved deposit funds, life assurance companies or registered organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1 July 1994, those people considering rolling over superannuation benefits will be able to require their fund to delay payment of their benefits for up to 90 days. This amendment will complement related tax amendments which will require rollovers to be made directly from the source to the destination fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the transfer of the reasonable benefit limit function to the Tax Office, the RBL provisions will be removed from the Act with effect from 1 July 1994. However transitional arrangements will permit benefits paid up to 30 June 1994 to be processed after that date in accordance with the existing rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments to the superannuation guarantee legislation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also make several amendments to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. </EMPHASIS>The amendments will ensure that if an employer's superannuation contribution under an industrial award in place prior to 21 August 1991 is based on the earnings of a standard employee, then the earnings of the standard employee can be used to calculate the employer's requisite contribution for SGC purposes. This measure will also apply if an employer's superannuation contributions are made under a law in place prior to 21 August 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also includes an amendment to exclude payments of salary or wages from the SGC where those payments are prescribed in the regulations. A complementary regulation will be made to prescribe certain categories of payments which are alternatives to Social Security payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will apply from 1 July 1992 and are not expected to have a significant impact on the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition some minor technical amendments will be made to clarify issues that have arisen since the commencement of the SGC. These amendments will generally apply from the date of introduction of the amendments.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill amends the Trade Practices Act to improve its operation and enhance its role in the building of a competitive Australian economy. The amendments are among the most significant reforms to the restrictive trade practices provisions since the Act's inception. The Bill provides for a strengthening of the provisions which prohibit anti-competitive mergers, while ensuring that the potential benefits of mergers, including the potential for increased export earnings, are duly considered. Penalties for non-compliance will be increased substantially. The practice of parties giving undertakings to the Trade Practices Commission will be legislatively recognised and provision will be made for the enforcement of such undertakings. The statutory prohibition on unconscionable conduct, which is currently limited to what are essentially consumer transactions, will be extended in modified form to cover commercial transactions. The Bill also makes minor amendments to clarify the provision which prohibits misuse of market power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Trade Practices Act was enacted in 1974 under the auspices of the then Attorney General, Mr Lionel Murphy. It has become a central pillar in the operation of efficient and competitive markets and is a law of which the Australian Labor Party justifiably may be proud. In 1974 the Act revolutionised the way in which Australian business was conducted. It signalled the beginning of the end for the old comfortable but inefficient practices such as resale price maintenance and market sharing arrangements. It was one of the most advanced competition laws in the world, and the reforms contained in this Bill will ensure that it remains so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These reforms will encourage competition and further discourage inefficient or unfair business practices. As the Federal Court has expressed it, the Act deals with `matters of high public policy' and is `vital to the presence of free competition and enterprise and a just society'. Part IV, which contains the restrictive trade practices provisions, is designed to facilitate and promote competition. This is based on the premise that competition will yield the best allocation of economic resources, the lowest prices to consumers, the highest quality of goods and services and the greatest national progress. Conduct which is anti-competitive therefore is seen as contrary to national economic well-being and to the interests of us all as consumers. The amendments highlight the Government's commitment to the preservation and enhancement of competition and complement the continuing process of micro-economic reform. They will help to improve the efficiency and fairness with which Australian business is conducted, thus helping to improve the living standards and quality of life of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments made by this Bill follow an extensive period of public consultation and debate about how best to update the Trade Practices Act to meet Australia's economic challenges, now and in the future. In particular, the provisions of the Act have been closely examined by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, known as the Griffiths Committee, and the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, known as the Cooney Committee. Many of the recommendations made by the Griffiths and Cooney reports are embodied in this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the present amendments, the Government has announced its intention to introduce a pre-merger notification scheme, to be the subject of later amendments, and has commissioned an independent inquiry into competition policy in Australia, with special emphasis on areas currently outside the scope of the Act. The development and adjustment of the Act is strong evidence of the Government's determination to achieve business laws which are adapted to the needs of the Australian economy and to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to examine the major provisions of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mergers and Acquisitions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Merger control is an important element of any law aiming to preserve levels of competition. Mergers can lessen competition, potentially providing increased scope for price rises or collusive behaviour and lessening dynamic factors such as the rate of innovation. These possible detriments provide the rationale for government intervention in the area of mergers. On the other hand, mergers can be a valuable source of increased efficiency or other public benefits. Such possible benefits require that a line be drawn between those mergers which are likely to be beneficial and those which are likely to be detrimental to the community as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For some time now, debate on the merger provisions has focused on where the line should most appropriately be drawn between acceptable and potentially unacceptable mergers. In its current form, section 50 prohibits mergers or acquisitions which create or substantially strengthen a position of dominance in a market, unless authorised by the Trade Practices Commission. Authorisation is available where there are sufficient public benefits to outweigh the anti-competitive detriments of mergers which would otherwise breach section 50.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After much consideration the Government has decided to amend section 50 to prohibit mergers or acquisitions which are likely to substantially lessen competition and which have not been authorised by the Commission. In an Act which seeks to preserve competition it is appropriate that the merger test should focus on the effect on competition in a market rather than on the dominance of a particular firm. The effect of the amendment will be to broaden the range of transactions which can be examined under section 50. This can only be pro-competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changed merger test will also apply to section 50A, which deals with certain mergers outside Australia which have an effect on markets within Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Merger Test Factors</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To minimise possible uncertainty that may be associated with the introduction of the new merger test, this Bill provides for the inclusion in section 50 of a non-exhaustive list of factors to which regard is to be had in determining whether a merger substantially lessens competition. The presence of these factors will help businesses to understand the new test and generally add certainty as to the policy intent underlying the changed merger test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The factors cover a wide range of matters which bear upon the issue of whether a given merger is likely to substantially lessen competition. In particular, the list includes reference to the actual and potential level of import competition in the market. There is to be no doubt that, where Australian firms seek to merge, regard should be had to the degree to which the conduct of the merged entity is likely to be constrained by overseas competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Matters to be Considered in Merger Authorisations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been some concern that a more stringent merger test could impede firms' abilities to achieve the necessary scale to develop export markets or to compete effectively with imported products. To allay these concerns this Bill contains amendments to the merger authorisation provisions. Section 90 provides that a merger may be authorised if there are sufficient public benefits. Without limiting the range of public benefits which the Commission and the Trade Practices Tribunal may otherwise examine, these amendments provide that a significant increase in the real value of exports, or a significant substitution of domestic products for imported goods, are to be regarded as a public benefit. The Commission and the Tribunal will also be required to take into account all other relevant matters that relate to the international competitiveness of any Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These matters will also be taken into account by the Trade Practices Tribunal in relation to offshore mergers covered by section 50A.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Time Limits for Merger Authorisations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New time limits in merger authorisation cases are designed to improve the efficiency with which the Act is administered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The time taken by the Commission to determine applications for authorisation of mergers is to be shortened from 45 days to 30 days, although in particularly complex cases the Commission will be able to extend the period to 45 days.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Tribunal will be required to determine appeals from the Commission in merger authorisation cases within 60 days, although this time limit will not apply if the matter is particularly complex or other special circumstances arise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Penalties</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current penalties for breaches of the Act are inadequate. Penalties for the competition provisions in Part IV have not been updated since 1974 and penalties for the consumer protection provisions in Part V have not been updated since 1986. The deterrent value of the penalties no longer reflects the seriousness with which the Government and the community view corporate misbehaviour and there has similarly been judicial comment to this effect. By way of example, in a case involving resale price maintenance the Federal Court said</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`. . . one can only suspect that the penalties have not been taken very seriously. Their deterrent effect has been insufficient, it appears, to counter-balance the profit apparently derived from protecting recommended prices against the effect of competition . . . ' .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where compliance with the Act is dependent on the threat of penalties there is clearly a need to increase the current level of penalties. But, where compliance is achieved efficiently and effectively by other means, the need to increase penalties is not apparent. In the case of secondary boycotts under sections 45D and 45E, no penalties under the Trade Practices Act have ever been imposed by a court or sought by the Minister or the Commission who alone are entitled to seek a pecuniary penalty. Conduct which breaches these provisions is consistently and adequately dealt with by other remedies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of this, the Government considers that penalties for breaches of the Act should be increased, with the exception of breaches of sections 45D and 45E, for which penalties should be retained at their current levels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will increase the maximum penalties for breaches of the competition provisions in Part IV, with the exception of sections 45D and 45E, to $10 million for corporations and $500,000 for individuals. Maximum fines for breaches of the consumer protection provisions in Part V will be increased to $200,000 for corporations and $40,000 for individuals. The new maximum levels of penalty have been set having regard to the levels of penalties in other industry legislation such as the maximum $10 million penalty under the Telecommunications Act, and the level of penalties overseas. The United States and Canada have maximum fines of $10 million for breach of their competition laws, and fines of up to A$115 million have been imposed for offences against European competition law. It is necessary to set maximum penalties at a level which will counter the potential profits to be obtained from conduct which breaches the Act. The new penalties will help to ensure a high level of compliance. It must be stressed, however, that these are maximum penalty levels. The appropriate level of penalty in any particular case remains, as always, a matter to be assessed and set by the Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Enforceable Undertakings</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has proved efficient in some cases for the Commission to avoid prolonged litigation by accepting undertakings from businesses to cease particular conduct or to take action which will lessen the otherwise undesirable effects of their conduct. This approach has been used in appropriate cases for several years and has avoided considerable cost to both the Commission and the businesses concerned. At the same time the outcomes have been demonstrably advantageous to affected third parties and consumers generally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recognising the importance and desirability of affording the Commission a flexible approach to the resolution of trade practices matters, the Government has decided to provide legislative recognition of this practice. This will promote a greater public awareness of the range of options available in the administration and enforcement of the Act. By providing for the enforceability of undertakings, the scheme will remove the need to rely on means outside the Act to enforce undertakings that people have given, should this prove necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unconscionable Conduct</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new provision is to be inserted which will prohibit unconscionable conduct not already covered by current section 52A. Section 52A is confined to unconscionable conduct involving goods or services of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption, and is thus generally concerned with consumer transactions. The new provision will prohibit unconscionable conduct by corporations in trade and commerce and thus will extend, but in modified form, the prohibition now in section 52A.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unconscionability is a well understood equitable doctrine, the meaning of which has been discussed by the High Court in recent times. It involves a party who suffers from some special disability or is placed in some special situation of disadvantage and an `unconscionable' taking advantage of that disability or disadvantage by another. The doctrine does not apply simply because one party has made a poor bargain. In the vast majority of commercial transactions neither party would be likely to be in a position of special disability or special disadvantage, and no question of unconscionable conduct would arise. Nevertheless, unconscionable conduct can occur in commercial transactions and there is no reason why the Trade Practices Act should not recognise this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the new provision, which will be numbered as section 51AA, and existing section 52A, which will be renumbered, are placed in a new Part IVA. The new provision will not extend the equitable principles of unconscionability beyond their current limits. The new provision refers to `conduct that is unconscionable within the meaning of the unwritten law, from time to time, of the States and Territories'. All transactions covered by the new provision are already covered by the equitable doctrine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The advantages of prohibiting in the Act what is already addressed by equity lie in the availability of remedies under the Act, the potential involvement of the Commission, including the possibility of representative actions being brought by the Commission in cases where it seeks an injunction, and the educative and deterrent effect of a legislative prohibition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minor Amendment to Section 46</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 46 prohibits a business with a substantial degree of power in a market from taking advantage of that power for certain anti-competitive purposes: eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor; preventing the entry of a person into a market; or deterring or preventing a person from engaging in competitive conduct in a market. There have been some suggestions that the section in its current form does not prohibit conduct with a purpose aimed at a class of competitors or persons, or aimed at competitors generally or persons generally. These amendments remove any such doubt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments which lower the threshold of the merger provisions will require the Commission to examine a somewhat greater number of mergers for anti-competitive effect, and may conceivably require more court actions to enforce the new law. These amendments, in conjunction with the proposed pre-merger notification scheme, have been estimated to require an additional five staff for the Commission, and additional funding has been allocated for this purpose. Additional resources for the enforcement of the new unconscionable conduct provision which are not capable of advance estimation will be decided on a case by case basis if necessary, if and when the Commission institutes proceedings under the provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the time limits which apply in merger authorisation cases will reduce administrative delays, and thus lessen the costs to business of compliance with the Act. More generally, the amendments made by this Bill will improve the efficiency and fairness with which Australian business is conducted, to the benefit of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HEALTH AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to introduce to the Senate a Bill which provides further measures to consolidate the Government's support for elderly people living in hostels and nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first of these measures involves amendments to the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act to allow for the introduction of sanctions against hostels which fail to comply with standards of care and quality of life for residents, and also the establishment of Hostel Standards Review Panels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments bring hostels into line with nursing homes, where the Commonwealth can take action in circumstances where nursing home proprietors are not providing residents with the quality of life and care which frail older members of the Australian community deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As occurs in respect of nursing homes, Standards Monitoring Teams now assess compliance of hostels against gazetted standards. These standards were developed by a committee which had representatives from State Governments, industry, union and consumer organisations and they have been in effect since 1 January 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments provide the Commonwealth with the ability to suspend payment to an organisation operating a hostel if that hostel is not complying with the standards. The suspension only applies to hostel places which are or become unoccupied after the Minister makes a declaration that the hostel does not comply with the standards. The effect of this action is that the hostel does not receive additional financial assistance for new residents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will also provide a peer review mechanism for a hostel operator who seeks review of the assessment of the hostel's compliance with standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the majority of hostels for frail older persons are providing a high level of care, there are unfortunately some which could provide better standards of care. In extreme cases, financial sanctions can be imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's experience with nursing homes is that there is a significant improvement in the performance of nursing homes which are not complying with standards, only after the Department has written to the proprietor and told them that a declaration of failure to meet the standards will be served.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is at this juncture, with the introduction of the measures in this Bill, that the hostel operator will be able to seek a review from a Hostel Standards Review Panel. These Panels will have members from the industry who are senior managers and command respect and stature among their peers. The amendments to the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act permit the Minister to make Orders providing for the membership and conduct of the Panels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Panel recommends to the Minister that a declaration of failure to comply is appropriate, they may also recommend that the Commonwealth suspend the payment of financial assistance to the hostel for new residents. A similar sanction has been available in parallel circumstances for nursing home proprietors since 1991. In that time, the Department has taken this course of action against 12 nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also seeks to amend the National Health Act in order to implement a 1992-93 Budget initiative providing funding to upgrade nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is considerable variation in the standards of accommodation offered in nursing homes. Many nursing home proprietors, while aiming to provide good quality care, have difficulty in meeting the Government's Outcome Standards, or health and fire safety standards, because they are operating in old or unsuitable buildings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The initiative in this Bill will enable nursing home proprietors to undertake substantial upgrading work which has been identified as necessary for the well being of their residents, but which they might not otherwise be able to afford. It provides an incentive for substantial upgrading that will improve the quality of care provided to the nursing home residents, and hence their quality of life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The benefit will be paid as a monthly recurrent benefit over a period of ten years and will be calculated in accordance with a formula based on a maximum cost per bed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, with regard to aged care measures, the Bill seeks to amend the National Health Act to make provision for a nursing home adviser to be appointed to a nursing home that has breached the conditions of approval of approved nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislative amendment gives nursing homes which may otherwise be closed an opportunity to improve their performance. The role of the adviser will be to assist the proprietor of the home to comply with the conditions of approval and will usually be someone with experience in the management of aged care facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the proprietor is unwilling to accept and pay for an adviser, then the normal sanctions process would continue, including closing the home, if that becomes necessary. The proprietor of the home will continue to be responsible for the management of the home under the National Health Act and the adviser will have no legal responsibility or liability under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also makes amendments to the Health Insurance Act to rectify an anomaly in the legislation that prejudices pathology practices which merge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently when two and more pathology practices merge the resulting Approved Pathology Authority (APA) that emerges loses the right to temporary licensed collection centres. A limited number of temporary licences are available to APAs for collection centres they operated prior to the restructuring amendments. Temporary licences are a transition arrangement that operates until 1 February 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a desirable outcome of the 1991 Budgetary changes that APAs merge or are absorbed by other APAs, thereby reducing the excess capacity which provides an incentive to overservice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments seek to remove a disincentive for mergers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the amendment ensures that the Minister's power to vary or revoke a determination of the maximum number of licensed collection centres which an Approved Pathology Authority may operate is not restricted by the operation of section 23DNC of the Principal Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his budget statement to this House of Representatives dated 18 August the Treasurer announced that the Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) scheme was to be extended effective from 1 July 1992. This Bill gives effect to the `new market' changes announced in 18 August 1992 media release by the Minister for Overseas Trade and Development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the introduction of amended legislation effective 1 July 1990, exporters have generally been limited to a maximum of eight EMD grants. This limitation arose from the recommendations of the 1989 Committee for Review of Export Market Development Assistance (the Hughes Committee) which suggested, amongst other things, that exporters place less emphasis on EMDG assistance, with fewer firms pushing into new markets, after having received eight grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the exception of approved bodies and approved trading houses, the eight grant cut off has been a total and final exclusion from the scheme, regardless of the merits of future market prospects and products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This change to the scheme, along with others, resulted in a significant reduction in the number of exporters with access to EMDG. Quite a number of those firms excluded clearly do have a lot to offer by way of new marketing initiatives. These may be existing product to a market which previously had not been considered, or a completely new product. Whilst Austrade does administer other financial assistance schemes which cover specific initiatives of exporters viz the innovative agricultural marketing program and the international trade enhancement scheme, these schemes are either limited to particular industries, or only cater for larger projects and initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an open access scheme catering to small to medium exporters, EMDG is an ideal vehicle to assist new marketing initiatives of the majority of exporters and potential exporters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill provides `new market' EMDG access beyond eight grant years for exporters who have not in the past three years achieved export earnings in respect of goods, services, industrial property rights or know how, in that particular market, of greater than $300,000. This threshold is increased to $1m in the case of a limited number of specified larger scale development project service activities. This will be the definition of a `new market', and exporters will have access to that `new market' for up to three years. To give full potential to this facility there will not be a limitation to the number of `new markets' in which an exporter may engage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is estimated that in excess of 400 exporters currently have the potential to take up this `new market' initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend this Bill to honourable senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MUTUAL RECOGNITION BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Mutual Recognition Bill 1992 is to establish a scheme for the mutual recognition of regulatory standards for goods and occupations adopted in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mutual recognition is an initiative arising out of the series of Meetings of Commonwealth, State and Territory Heads of Government which have been conducted over the past two years with the objective of achieving better intergovernmental relations to improve the operation of the national economy and the quality and effectiveness of services governments provide.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal aim of mutual recognition is to remove artificial barriers to interstate trade in goods and the mobility of labour caused by regulatory differences among Australian States and Territories. Mutual recognition is expected to enhance greatly the international competitiveness of the Australian economy and is a major step forward in the achievement of micro-economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It involves a recognition by Heads of Government that the time has come for Australia to create a truly national market&mdash;a goal which the founding fathers of this nation enshrined in the Constitution, but which the parochial politics of successive State and Territory governments have frustrated for almost one hundred years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the special Premiers' Conference in Brisbane in October 1990, Heads of Government agreed to apply mutual recognition of standards in all areas where uniformity was not considered essential to national economic efficiency. Heads of Government gave their in-principle support to models of mutual recognition for goods and occupations at the special Premiers' Conference held in Sydney in July 1991, subject to the outcome of a national community consultation process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National consultation between July and November 1991 involved the release of a Discussion Paper entitled "The Mutual Recognition of Standards and Regulations in Australia" and a series of seminars in each capital city conducted by the Honourable Neville Wran, AC, QC. Input was sought from business, industry, trade unions, the professions, standards setting bodies, consumer and community representatives on any necessary refinements to the mutual recognition models. Some 200 written submissions were received.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Results of the consultation process were considered by Premiers and Chief Ministers at their meeting in Adelaide on 21-22 November 1991. Whilst there were different views expressed at the seminars and in the submissions, the concept of mutual recognition was widely embraced as a means to overcome regulatory impediments to a national market in goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The majority of submissions did not call for substantial changes to the models, although some expressed a preference for uniformity instead of mutual recognition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On that point, it is important to note that mutual recognition is intended to complement the efforts of regulatory authorities in achieving nationally uniform standards. It will not impede those efforts where it is agreed that uniform national standards are necessary. On the contrary, the agreed scheme includes mechanisms for facilitating their adoption and I expect that mutual recognition will hasten the successful resolution of such endeavours.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 11 May 1992, Heads of Government signed a final Agreement Relating to Mutual Recognition requesting and empowering the Commonwealth to pass an Act to give effect to the principles of mutual recognition by overriding any State or Territory laws inconsistent with these principles. The Agreement requires the States and Territories to use their best endeavours to pass the necessary legislation by 31 October 1992; and the Commonwealth to use its best endeavours to pass legislation by 1 January 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is an indication of the common sense which underlies the concept of mutual recognition, that these proposals have had the clear support of governments of all different political persuasion from the outset.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PRINCIPLES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation is based on two simple principles. The first is that goods which can be sold lawfully in one State or Territory may be sold freely in any other State or Territory even though the goods may not comply with all the details of regulatory standards in the second State or Territory:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If goods are acceptable for sale in one State or Territory, then there is no reason why they should not be sold anywhere in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was not so long ago that it was virtually impossible to market cooking margarine nationally in one package. Western Australia required margarine to be packed in cube tubs whereas the familiar round tub was acceptable everywhere else.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under Mutual Recognition, producers in Australia will only have to ensure that their products comply with the laws in the place of production. If they do so, they will then be free to distribute and sell their products throughout Australia without being subjected to further testing or assessment of their product. This ensures a national market for those products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, goods manufactured or produced overseas which comply with the relevant standards in the jurisdiction through which they are imported, will be able to be sold in any jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second principle is that if a person is registered to carry out an occupation in one State or Territory, then he or she should be able to be registered and carry on the equivalent occupation in any other State or Territory:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If someone is assessed to be good enough to practise a profession or occupation in one State or Territory, then they should be able to do so anywhere in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person will only need to give notice, including evidence of their home registration, to the relevant registration authority in another jurisdiction to be entitled immediately to commence practice in an equivalent occupation in that second State or Territory. Local registration authorities will be required to accept the judgement of their interstate counterparts of a person's educational qualifications, experience, character or fitness to practise. I stress that the occupations between which a person seeks to move from one State to another have to be substantially the same.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The underlying premise for mutual recognition is that the existing regulatory arrangements of each State or Territory generally provide a satisfactory set of standards. Thus, on implementation of mutual recognition, no jurisdiction will be inundated with products that are inherently dangerous, unsafe or unhealthy, nor will there be an influx of inadequately qualified practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISM</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The mechanism for implementing mutual recognition is an innovative one. The States and Territories have agreed  to request and empower the Commonwealth to pass a single Act which, once enacted by the Commonwealth, will override any State or Territory Acts or Regulations that are inconsistent with the mutual recognition principles. The States and Territories will effectively cede power to one another through the mechanism of Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The additional powers of the Commonwealth will be limited. States and Territories are not granting extensive new powers to regulate goods and occupations. Rather, the Commonwealth is being empowered, to the extent to which such powers are not otherwise included in its legislative powers, to pass a single piece of legislation which will override inconsistent State and Territory legislation. Amendments to the Commonwealth Act will require unanimous agreement among all participating jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OPERATION OF THE SCHEME</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The focus of mutual recognition is on the regulation of goods at the point of sale and on entry by registered persons into equivalent occupations in another State or Territory. Mutual recognition will not affect the ability of jurisdictions to regulate the operation of businesses or the conduct of persons registered in an occupation. Nor is it intended to affect the registration of bodies corporate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also important to note that laws that regulate the manner in which goods are sold (such as laws restricting the sale of certain goods to minors) or the manner in which sellers conduct their businesses are explicitly exempted from mutual recognition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For occupations, the legislation is expressed to apply to individuals and occupations carried on by them. A registered practitioner wishing to practice in another State will be able to notify the local registration authority of his or her intention to seek registration in an equivalent occupation there and provide the required evidence. The local registration authority then has one month to process the application and to make a decision on whether or not to grant registration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pending registration, the practitioner is entitled, once the notice is made and all necessary information provided, to commence practice immediately in that occupation, subject to the payment of fees and compliance with various indemnity or insurance requirements in relation to that occupation. No other preconditions can be imposed on the entitlement to commence practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To avoid costly and lengthy appeals processes in State and Territory Courts, the Commonwealth Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) will hear appeals against  decisions of local registration authorities and will have the power to declare an occupation to be non-equivalent. States and Territories have agreed to vesting the AAT with this additional jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In areas where national uniformity may be appropriate, particularly public health and safety and the environment, the Intergovernmental Agreement provides for a concerned State or Territory to refer a matter relating to a particular good or occupation to the appropriate Ministerial Council for a decision on whether or not to develop and apply a uniform standard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is expected that where a Ministerial Council decides that a uniform standard is required in respect of a particular occupation, it will apply the relevant national competency standards if such standards are available. Heads of Government asked that the process of developing such standards be accelerated so that by the time mutual recognition commences, national competency standards should be developed for all regulated occupations and professions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the area of occupational health and safety, Heads of Government, in the context of mutual recognition, have directed relevant Ministers to achieve uniform occupational health and safety standards and uniform standards in relation to dangerous goods by the end of 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the unnecessary costs for producers in accommodating minor differences in regulatory requirements of States and Territories in relation to goods will be removed. Genuine competition across State and Territory borders will be encouraged as a result of producers having more ready access to the Australian market as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labour mobility will be enhanced with the removal of artificial barriers linked to registration and licensing laws. As a result, we will be able to make better use of the skills of the labour force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These major improvements in the regulation of the sale of goods and the mobility of labour are expected to enhance greatly the international competitiveness of the Australian economy and represent an important step forward in the achievement of micro-economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mutual recognition is an outstanding example of what can be achieved when all governments in Australia co-operate and work together in the national interest. The Commonwealth Government would like to acknowledge the positive contribution made by all Heads of Government in fostering and promoting this important development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill, and commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT AMENDMENT (FOREIGN INVESTMENT) BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is the Government's third major piece of legislation in its program to reform the taxation of foreign source income. This revised Bill contains the necessary new provisions for inclusion in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to give effect to the Government's approach in relation to the taxation of Foreign Investment Funds. The Foreign Investment Fund measures contained in this Bill will take effect on and from 1 January 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of this body of tax reform law, with its many rounds of consultation with affected taxpayers and their advisers, demonstrates this Government's commitment to tackle the hard issue of tax minimisation and deferral opportunities available to Australians through some types of offshore investment while recognising some taxpayers' legitimate need to invest offshore to achieve portfolio diversification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The precise targeting of the Foreign Investment Fund measures as contained in this Bill is the result of extensive consultation over the last 12 months. Numerous responses to the release of the broad design features of the Foreign Investment Fund measures contained in a Budget press release of August last year, a detailed Information Paper of April this year and an independent assessment of the initial Bill that was commissioned by the Treasurer has provided significant input to the final Bill before you today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would now like to briefly discuss the nature of the consultancy and the major findings of this assessment contained in the Arnold Report and adopted by the Government as outlined in the Government's response. Both these papers were publicly released by the Treasurer last month.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The brief for the consultancy, announced by the Treasurer on 25 June 1992, involved the consultant in discussions with affected taxpayers and their advisers in relation to the implementation of the Government's approach to the taxation of Foreign Investment Funds. It was required that the report make recommendations on implementation issues as well as how to further minimise tax avoidance opportunities in this area of offshore investment. The consultant appointed was Professor Brian Arnold of the University of Western Ontario, Canada. Professor Arnold is a well known and respected expert in the area of international tax law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Arnold Report acknowledged the need for the Foreign Investment Fund measures proposed by this Government and endorsed the basic approach taken to implement these necessary measures. The adoption of the bulk of Professor Arnold's recommendations reflected in this Bill is a demonstration of this Government's commitment to further refine the scope of the Foreign Investment Fund measures to target areas of tax minimisation and deferral and where possible reduce compliance and administration costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before providing a brief background and outline of the Foreign Investment Fund measures contained in this Bill I would like to draw attention to a new exemption from these measures. In cases where only 5 per cent or less of a taxpayer's aggregate interests in Foreign Investment Funds will give rise to taxation under these measures, because the other 95 per cent or more of the taxpayer's interests are exempt under another of the exemptions, then the entire interests in foreign investment funds will not be subject to these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This exemption recognises the need for balanced investment portfolios. Taxpayers with minimal investment in `black list activity' offshore companies and in offshore trusts do not put the revenue at risk and are rightly excluded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inclusion of an exemption for those taxpayers with balanced investment portfolios in foreign investment funds, coupled with the change to a `black list activity' approach to provide an exemption for active business companies as recommended by the Arnold Report,has closely targeted the Foreign Investment Fund measures at offshore investment that provides tax minimisation and deferral.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for the Foreign Investment Fund measures, as well as  the Foreign Tax Credit System introduced in 1987 and the Foreign Source Income measures introduced in 1991, arose from a tax system that was heavily biased in favour of investments in low-tax countries. The system also encouraged Australians to artificially source profits in offshore tax havens and, in cases where Australians could control the distribution policy of a foreign entity, to defer remittance of profits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Foreign Tax Credit System which has operated since the 1987-88 income year  replaced the system that gave a  general exemption from Australian tax to income that was earned offshore that had been subject to foreign tax, regardless of the amount of tax paid. The Foreign Tax Credit System provides generally for foreign income to be subject to Australian tax with a credit being allowed for any foreign tax paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Foreign Source Income measures which took effect from the 1990-91 income year introduced an accruals system of taxing foreign source income. The accruals taxation element of this legislation is directed at passive income and other forms of tainted income that is derived in low tax countries by Australian controlled foreign companies and accumulated offshore, avoiding Australian tax. It also applies to certain non-resident trusts to which Australians have transferred property or services for less than full value.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill before you will introduce legislation to counter avoidance opportunities that remain after the introduction of the Foreign Source Income measures. These are the cases where a foreign company or trust, although not generally controlled by Australians, is nevertheless an attractive investment vehicle because it allows for the accumulation of income offshore, especially in low-tax countries, allowing the investor to minimise and defer Australian tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian residents who have invested in offshore life bonds or other foreign life policies with an investment component will also be subject to the Foreign Investment Fund measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This new approach to the taxation of foreign source income will ensure that Australians investing offshore pay their fair share of tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will also amend the existing trust provisions in their application to non-resident trust income. These amendments will supplement the Foreign Source Income provisions in areas where the Foreign Investment Fund measures will not apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A minor technical amendment to the Controlled Foreign Company measures is also included in this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now turn to the more detailed aspects of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Foreign Investment Fund Measures</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>Foreign companies and foreign trusts</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Foreign Investment Fund measures will apply to Australian taxpayers who have an interest in a foreign company or a foreign trust. For a foreign company, these will generally be taxpayers who hold shares in the company. Similarly, for a foreign trust the measures will apply to taxpayers who have an interest in the corpus or income of the trust, most commonly units in a unit trust.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In designing the Foreign Investment Fund measures, the  Government has carefully targeted those non-controlling interests in foreign entities that provide the greatest scope for tax avoidance. The particular focus of the measures is on long-term interests in multi-tiered, offshore investments that enable the deferral of Australian tax through the accumulation of low taxed income offshore. That income is usually converted into concessionally-taxed capital gains on the disposal of the interests. The measures include a range of exemptions to ensure that they are properly targeted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Interests held for less than 12 months will in general not be subject to Foreign Investment Fund taxation. In addition, Foreign Investment Fund taxation will not apply in the year of disposal of a taxpayer's entire Foreign Investment Fund interest regardless of how long that interest has been held. An exception is made in the case of a foreign life policy (which will be taxed up until the point of disposal).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A small investor exemption applies where an individual taxpayer has offshore investments not exceeding $50,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The active business exemption will ensure that there is no tax hindrance to portfolio diversification or joint venture participation by Australians who wish to invest directly into a foreign company that is principally engaged in active business. These active businesses provide no or little scope for tax minimisation and deferral.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The `black list' of activities not eligible for the exemption currently includes banking, general and life insurance, real estate, financial services, certain investment business and management of funds. However, banking, insurance or real estate conducted in a company that is publicly listed and whose shares are widely held will be exempted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further exemption will ensure that Australian investors have access to markets where a country prohibits direct investment on its stock exchanges. This is provided by excluding from the measures investments made direct in certain approved country funds in those countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures will not apply to short term visitors whose stay in Australia does not exceed 4 years and who have not applied for or been granted permanent residency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Foreign life assurance policies</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Foreign Investment Fund  measures will also apply to taxpayers who have a life assurance policy where that policy is issued by a non-resident. However, policies that provide  life cover only are excluded from the measures. Policies issued before 1 July 1992 which cannot be cancelled, surrendered or redeemed are also excluded if they are not materially altered after that date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non-resident trusts</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time of introduction of the Foreign Source Income measures, it was recognised by the Government that avenues still remained for the deferral of Australian tax on trust income of foreign trusts.  The Foreign Investment Fund measures will address those cases in which trust income is accumulating for the benefit of a resident even though the trust may not be controlled by Australian residents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also introduce changes to the method of calculating the beneficiary's share of the income of a non-resident trust for those foreign trusts not taxed under the Foreign Investment Fund methods of taxation. These changes will align the taxation treatment of those beneficiaries with the taxation treatment for non-resident trusts that will operate under the Foreign Investment Fund measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will make changes to the way the interest charge currently applies to distributions to Australian beneficiaries of accumulated income of non-resident trust estates. The principal change will be to exclude from the interest charge distributions made by non-resident public unit trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial impact</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The revenue gains of the Foreign Investment Fund  measures will generally be realised after the end of the 1992-93 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is estimated that these measures will yield a revenue of about $90 million in the 1993-94 financial year and $200 million in the 1994-5 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These estimated revenue figures have been revised to take into account the new commencement date of 1 January 1993 and the recent release of relevant statistics that show an increase in portfolio offshore investment that can be expected to continue in the medium term.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">IMMIGRATION (EDUCATION) CHARGE BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this Bill is to impose a charge on those adults who apply for certain visas and entry permits and who will need instruction in the English language. The Bill also provides scope for charging people who are already resident in Australia and who enrol in courses arranged under the Commonwealth-funded Adult Migrant English program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The charges are in two forms:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Up to a maximum of $4080 for applicants from 1 January 1993 who are issued visas or entry permits after 1 March 1993.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Up to $250 a year for current residents enrolling or re-enrolling in Adult Migrant English Courses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In return the Commonwealth undertakes to fund up to 510 hours of tuition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The charges are part of the broader reform strategy spelt out in a statement made jointly with my colleague, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. In brief, the statement details plans for removing the backlog of need for English as a Second Language (ESL) among long-term residents who are registered jobseekers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department, through the A.M.E.P., will prevent the backlog from growing:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">by honouring commitments to currently enrolled clients;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">and by delivering ESL for incoming migrants more effectively than in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will also provide for other groups, particularly women, who may fall outside those broad priorities. $500,000 is earmarked for them. Our strategies will bring significant benefits to Australian society. Commonwealth funding of the A.M.E.P. has increased substantially in recent years, exceeding $100 million in 1991-92.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This year total Commonwealth resources for adult ESL will exceed $142 million, of which $42.2 million will be targeted at jobseekers through labour market training programs. As these commitments demonstrate, the Government recognises that proficiency in English is an essential part of Australian life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Learning English benefits Australian society by facilitating communication&mdash;and hence equality of opportunity&mdash;among Australians. At the same time proficiency in English benefits individuals. It is reasonable therefore that individuals who benefit from the Adult Migrant English Program should contribute to its cost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are exceptions&mdash;among them refugees, preferential family members and those who are wholly dependant on social security payments. Hence revenue projections are modest:  $3.65 Million in 1992/93 and $9.7 Million in 1993/94. The scheme  will allow increased resources for the program with no increase in Commonwealth appropriations. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the benefits of charging go beyond any contribution to revenue. Client contribution to cost will encourage greater motivation from students. More importantly, charging places a greater obligation on service providers to meet the expectations of clients. The charges, together with the other reforms I have touched upon, will result in a better managed, client responsive program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MIGRATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this Bill amends the Immigration (Education) Act 1971 and the Migration Act 1958. The amendments will permit regulations to be made which provide for the charging and recovery of fees for English language tuition. These are historic developments when considered in tandem with the Immigration (Education) Charge Bill 1992 introduced with this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further amendments enable the Commonwealth to carry out its intention of providing 510 hours of English language tuition in an approved English 'course to each eligible adult migrant within a specified time. Future regulations will specify who is to be charged how much.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the first time, clients of the program will know clearly what service they can expect. That is a significant improvement on previous arrangements when clients had no guarantees of access to the Adult Migrant English Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill contains other amendments to the Migration Act. These amendments will allow domestic passengers who are on domestic sectors of international flights with passengers who have cleared immigration to be processed by immigration upon arrival at their destination. The Bill also contains several minor amendments of a technical nature. Those amendments are explained in the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SEX DISCRIMINATION AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to be able to move the introduction of a piece of legislation which will significantly improve and extend the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (`the SDA').</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments restate and re-emphasise the Government's commitment to constant vigilance when it comes to improving the status of Australian women. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments I introduce today are part of the Government's response to a number of the recommendations made by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, chaired by Mr Michael Lavarch MP, (`the Lavarch Committee') in its Report of its Inquiry into Equal Opportunity and Equal Status for Women in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's Report entitled Half Way to Equal was released on 30 April 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Lavarch Committee engaged in one of the most wide-ranging and comprehensive inquiries ever conducted into the status of women in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the course of its Inquiry the Lavarch Committee received over 600 submissions, held 19 days of public hearings in which it heard testimony from 181 witnesses, held four two-day public seminars and released four discussion papers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequently, the Committee's Report presents one of the most detailed pictures of the position of Australian women ever to be made available. It also represents the first comprehensive evaluation of the operation and effectiveness of the SDA since it commenced in 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has done a fine job and is to be congratulated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee made a substantial number of recommendations, including many worthwhile and practical suggestions for amending the SDA and improving the functioning of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (`HREOC').</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill contains a number of amendments to the SDA which implement those recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also amend the Industrial Relations Act 1988 (`the IR Act') as part of a new mechanism to allow review of awards and certified agreements which are discriminatory on the basis of sex, marital status or pregnancy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also contains, where appropriate, amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (`the RDA'), the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (`the HREOC Act') and the recently passed Disability Discrimination legislation to bring these acts into line with the amendments to the SDA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Details of the amendments contained in the Bill are set out in the Explanatory Memorandum, which I present to the House.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me briefly summarise their provisions while at the same time informing the Senate of the reasons for the Government's speedy response to the Lavarch recommendations and the other initiatives contained in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We as a Government recognise the important contribution to the Australian economy made by Australian women, and we do all that we can to encourage their greater participation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women have in fact taken up the majority of new jobs created since Labor came to office almost a decade ago.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also recognise that there are still barriers to women's full and equal participation and our sex discrimination and affirmative action laws were designed to help remedy this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women by and large still earn less than men, despite legislated provisions for equal pay, because women and men tend not to be in the same jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women encounter barriers to promotion&mdash;the so-called `glass ceiling'. Sexual harassment remains an unwelcome feature in many women's working lives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where such barriers can be addressed by legislation, we will continue our proud pioneering record.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today represents such an occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no doubt that the Sex Discrimination Act has helped change attitudes towards discrimination and has made us understand how widespread&mdash;and unacceptable&mdash;sexual harassment is.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But like most laws, these need to be scrutinised from time to time to ensure that they are in tune with current realities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Lavarch Report provides us with the opportunity to revisit this legislation and the amendments I introduce today represent the Government's response to the Report's recommendations concerning anti-discrimination legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Lavarch Report also contained a great many other recommendations which did not involve anti-discrimination legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These recommendations are at present being studied by the Government and we hope to be in a position to provide a further response by the end of November.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today, let me outline our response to the legislative recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industrial Awards</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have decided to extend the Sex Discrimination Act to industrial awards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concern has been expressed by women's organisations that the advent of enterprise bargaining and the new certified agreement provisions contained in the Industrial Relations Act may have an adverse impact on women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the "no disadvantage" test contained in the certified agreement provisions is intended to protect well-established standards such as maternity leave and parental leave, the Government accepts that it will not necessarily operate against provisions which discriminate against women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed changes will underline the social justice safeguards in the Government's industrial relations framework.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They will signal to all workers, especially women, that the shift to a more decentralised system is a part of a managed and responsible process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Discriminatory acts done in direct compliance with an award are currently exempted from the operation of the SDA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Lavarch Committee received a number of submissions which were critical of this exemption.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response, we have developed a mechanism so that complaints concerning a discriminatory award will be able to be made to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission under proposed section 50A of the SDA alleging that a person has been discriminated against under an award.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it appears to the Sex Discrimination Commissioner that the award is discriminatory, the Commissioner must refer the award to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;unless the Commissioner is of the opinion that the complaint is trivial, vexatious, misconceived or lacking in substance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a complaint is referred to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (`the AIRC') the AIRC will then convene a hearing to review the award.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Sex Discrimination Commissioner will then have standing to appear before the AIRC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the AIRC is of the view that the award operates in a discriminatory way, then it will be required to take whatever action is necessary to remove the discrimination, unless it considers that a variation would not be in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the complaint concerns a certified agreement, the AIRC must give the parties to the agreement an opportunity to amend the agreement so as to remove the discrimination, before taking the necessary action to remove the discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sexual Harassment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Division 3 of Part II of the SDA, the sexual harassment provisions, currently apply only to sexual harassment in employment and harassment of students by staff in educational institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current definitions of sexual harassment also require that the complainant suffer disadvantage, or that the complainant had reasonable grounds for believing that she or he would suffer detriment, if she or he objected to the harassment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that most members of the general community would now accept that a person can be subjected to sexual harassment even if she or he suffers no detriment or disadvantage in connection with her or his employment or education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, this Bill will amend the definition of sexual harassment to remove the requirement that the complainant demonstrate disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new definition, the test will be satisfied if the complainant felt offended, humiliated or intimidated by unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature from the respondent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The test also has an objective element: that is, a reasonable person, having regard to all the circumstances, would have anticipated that the complainant would be offended, humiliated or intimidated by the conduct that is the subject of the complaint.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill extends the ambit of the sexual harassment provisions to the provision of goods, services and facilities, the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs, and dealings in connection with land and the provision of accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequently, it will now, for example, be unlawful for a landlord to sexually harass a tenant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing proscription of sexual harassment in education will also be extended to cover situations where a member of the staff of an educational institution is sexually harassed by an adult student, or where one adult student is sexually harassed by another adult student.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Victimisation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Lavarch Committee expressed concern that the effectiveness of the SDA could be put at risk by a real fear of victimisation of complainants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SDA, the RDA and the HREOC Act will be amended to allow complaints of victimisation to be considered through a process of conciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the model that has been used in the recently passed Disability Discrimination legislation and is also the model used in State and Territory anti-discrimination legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Representative Complaints</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The representative complaints provisions of the SDA, the RDA and the Disability Discrimination legislation will be replaced by new provisions adapted from the representative proceedings provisions of Part IVA of the Federal Court Amendment Act 1991 which came into force earlier this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will make it easier for a representative complaint to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The procedure for dealing with such complaints will also be flexible enough to ensure that they are handled efficiently and that the procedure is not abused. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Determinations </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments contained in this Bill will put in place a new mechanism for enforcing determinations by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission under the SDA, the RDA and the Disability Discrimination legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, a complainant who wishes to enforce a determination of the Commission must bring proceedings in the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In practice, this has meant that the Federal Court has had to hear the matter afresh.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This duplication obviously increases stress on the parties, as well as increasing the financial cost borne by the parties and the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Understandably, the existing enforcement mechanism has been subject to judicial criticism (for example, comments made by Wilcox J in Maynard v Neilson (1988) EOC 92-226).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new mechanism, a determination will be registered in the Federal Court, and will have effect as if it were an order of the Court, unless the respondent to the determination applies to the Court, within 28 days, for a review of the determination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the absence of such an application, action can be taken through the usual processes of the Court to enforce the determination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I am confident that these amendments will strengthen and streamline our anti-discrimination laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They will ensure that women&mdash;and men&mdash;can get on with their lives, their working lives, their education, able to seek redress against discrimination and disadvantage should that be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government is committed to preserving women's ability to make choices about their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women value their new independence and ability to take part in all areas of society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will ensure that no obstacle or barrier stands in their way that we have the power to remedy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We stand for the full equality of women and men.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation goes a long way towards furthering that aim.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HUMAN RIGHTS AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill contains amendments to the Commonwealth's human rights legislation to create the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commissioner and to proscribe dismissal of a worker on the ground of his or her family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill provides another example of this Government's commitment to implementing its undertakings to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people arising from the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were many aspects to the report of the Royal Commission. The fact that the Commission was required at all and the extent of the recommendations made, clearly indicate a need for there to be an ongoing overall report on the exercise of basic human rights by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The extent of the disadvantage suffered by indigenous Australians was graphically highlighted by the work of the Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The response of all Governments to the recommendations of the Royal Commission has been very positive. But there continues to exist a need for us as a nation to regularly focus on the extent to which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are able to exercise the basic human rights that the rest of the nation take for granted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The creation of this office and the production of a yearly report will provide this focus. I hope that all Governments will actively co-operate in the work of the Commissioner to allow for that office to be part of the ongoing push to improve the everyday lives of the first Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner will have an opportunity to continue the work already done by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in highlighting the plight of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the often least appreciated aspects of legislation is the potential of that legislation to educate public opinion and attitudes far in excess of those who may actually be directly affected by it. In the area of human rights generally this is particularly critical. The Government has a very proud record in relation to human rights reform commencing with the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986, the recently passed Disability Discrimination Act 1992 and now these reforms. This is not to mention our work on ratifying numerous international instruments during the term of the Hawke and Keating Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation creates a new part to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act to establish the office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. The Commissioner's major function is to be the preparation of a yearly report on the enjoyment and exercise of human rights by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. That report is to be tabled in the Parliament and sent to all States and Territories. It will, therefore, be a public document available to all. One of the ongoing tasks that the Commissioner will undertake as part of the production of his or her report will be to review the overall implementation by all Governments of the recommendations of the Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner is to be a full member of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and will have all the powers necessary to carry out his or her functions. In particular, the Commissioner will have the power to seek and obtain information and documents from government agencies. Commonwealth, State and Territory Government agencies will be subject to this power but a State or Territory Attorney-General will be able to provide a certificate that release of the information would not be in the public interest for a number of reasons set out in the Bill. These include that release would prejudice criminal investigations, that it would show the deliberation of Cabinet or Executive Council of a State or Territory etc. Similar power already exists in the Act for the Commonwealth Attorney-General. The Commissioner is also prevented from seeking details which would identify individuals unless they consent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner will also have functions relating to promoting and encouraging respect for the human rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner is to be appointed by the Governor General for a period of up to 7 years and is able to be reappointed. The legislation requires that a person appointed must have significant experience in community life of either Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner will also be required to consult with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and may consult with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and organisations as appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Workers with Family Responsibilities</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to be able to move the introduction of legislation on a matter which so deeply affects the lives and opportunities of people with family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Life in Australia at work and in the family has undergone profound changes over the last three decades. The expectations of the social and economic roles of men and women are broadening. This attitudinal shift is supported by increases in the participation of women in the workforce and education; a growing recognition and understanding of the value of carers of families, people with disabilities, our sick and elderly; and the ageing of our population.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has recognised that the interaction between work and family responsibilities has implications for the achievement of social justice for our citizens, as well as having a critical impact on the efficiency and productivity of our economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In March 1990, Australia ratified International Labour Organisation Convention 156, `A Convention Concerning Equal Opportunities and Equal Treatment for Men and Women Workers: Workers with Family Responsibilities', (`ILO 156') and it came into effect in March 1991. Prior to ratification, Australia already had a number of measures in place which comply with the principles underlying ILO 156. However, our ratification of ILO 156 relies on the flexibility provided by its staged implementation process, and the Government plans to undertake further action to supplement these measures in order to ensure full compliance over time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In March 1991, an interdepartmental committee (`IDC') was established to co-ordinate the development of the strategy chaired by the Department of Industrial Relations. The overriding principle embodied in ILO 156 is that of equal opportunity for all in employment through, where possible, the removal of discrimination on the grounds of family responsibilities. To this end, the IDC endorsed the following legislative strategy, in two stages: one for immediate implementation and the second with a view to implementation within two years. The first legislative stage is to amend the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (`SDA') to proscribe dismissal from employment on the ground of family responsibilities. The second stage is to enter into wide ranging consultations with a view, at this point, to a further amendment to the SDA to prohibit more generally, discrimination in employment on the ground of family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is this first stage which is the subject of the Bill before Parliament. This amendment seeks to give effect to Article 8 of ILO 156 which provides that family responsibilities shall not, as such, constitute a valid reason for termination of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to a more detailed description of the amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment is intended to be narrow in its scope in that it provides protection only against discrimination on the grounds of family responsibilities which takes the form of dismissal. Family responsibilities is defined by reference to the terms of ILO 156, which applies to workers with family responsibilities in relation to their dependent children as well as for the care and support of other members of the immediate family. This definition is not intended to be exhaustive. The provisions of this Act are intended to apply to a situation in which an employee has assumed the responsibility for, and therefore could be said to have a special relationship with, any other member of his or her family with regard to their care and support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Discrimination is defined to include less favourable treatment, that is direct discrimination. This new provision will apply only to a dismissal on the ground of the existence of family responsibilities, or of a characteristic that appertains generally or is imputed generally to persons with family responsibilities. It is not intended to cover, for example, the dismissal of an employee because the employee is unwilling to change a shift, or has a period of unauthorised leave, even though both may be due to family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While some members of the community may be concerned that this amendment does not go far enough, I am confident that it points the way to a much broader direction being pursued by the Government, with the assistance and views of both employers and employees. We look forward to a time when workers with family responsibilities will be able to work without being subject to discrimination and as far as it is possible, without conflict between their employment and those family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate and I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AFFIRMATIVE ACTION (EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR WOMEN) AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am very pleased to move the introduction of these amendments to the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act 1986. The amendments before you today arise out of an extensive review of the Act which involved consultation with all parties affected by the legislation, including employers, unions, higher educational institutions and women's organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">None of the proposed changes alter in any fundamental way the original intention of the Act. Contrary to the fears and concerns expressed by some people some six years ago, the Act enjoys widespread support among employer organisations, unions and the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many employers have indicated that the Affirmative Action Act has been very useful in focusing their attention on the needs of their women employees, and that there have been positive spin-offs in efficiency generated by implementing equal opportunity policies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The importance of affirmative action programs was highlighted in the recent Lavarch Committee Report, Half Way to Equal. The Committee was categorical in its support for affirmative action programs which it stated are "integral to greater access to career opportunities for all women". This Government wholeheartedly endorses these views and, indeed, the Bill before you forms an important part of our response to the recommendations arising from the Lavarch Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review of the Act and the findings of the Lavarch inquiry came to similar conclusions about the effectiveness of affirmative action programs. Over the last six years, the Act has played a pivotal role in winning support for the principle of equal opportunity. Independent research commissioned as part of the review found overwhelming endorsement for the equal participation of women in paid employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, while there are a growing number of companies with exceptional affirmative action programs, many employers have yet to move beyond the rhetoric to institute comprehensive changes in their own management and work practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for ingoing reform is clear.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While women make up 42 per cent of the paid workforce, they are often disadvantaged at work. Despite the increasing participation rate, many women are confined to a narrow range of jobs, at the bottom end of the hierarchy with far less access to training, career paths and reasonable pay. Many women work part-time to balance the double load of domestic responsibilities and paid employment. These women are often excluded from the benefits accorded to full time work. The predominance of women in low paid part time work is a key explanation for continuing pay inequity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although it is important for Government to provide the framework for change through legislation, real structural and attitudinal change has to occur at the level of the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is why the Government is absolutely committed to ensuring that, over the next few years, there will be a much greater emphasis on the quality of affirmative action programs. We will be working closely with employers, unions and other interested parties to help make equal opportunity in employment a reality for all women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will do this, not only because the Government has a fundamental commitment to ensuring that women get a fair deal at work, but also because this approach is vital to the health of the Australian economy. More and more businesses are recognising that international competitiveness and increased productivity are dependent on valuing and utilising the talents of the whole workforce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Outmoded personnel policies and attitudes which hold women back are against the interests of any organisation which wants to do well in today's competitive environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Affirmative action provides the springboard for the kind of initiatives which need to occur so that women can contribute fully to their workplace&mdash;from employer supported childcare to career break schemes to more flexible, family friendly hours of work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me take a moment to contrast this Government's approach with that of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition has said it will abolish the Affirmative Action Agency but still keep the legislation. How can the Opposition claim to be in favour of equal opportunity and simultaneously destroy the organisation which has been set up to advise, assist and monitor employer compliance with the Affirmative Action Act?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition's policy is totally out of touch with the community. Employers have indicated their support for the Agency and want it to provide them with more assistance and advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition's policy to abolish the Agency is only the tip of the iceberg. The Opposition's industrial relations policy will be particularly harmful to women because they are less likely to be members of unions and are often in low skilled jobs with little bargaining power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition's policy would remove many women from their awards and then force them on to individual employment contracts where they could face big cuts in their pay and conditions. Women could be forced to work long hours in total conflict with their family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In complete contrast, the Government's approach to industrial relations and the amendments to the Affirmative Action Act, recognises the importance of protecting award wages and conditions and improving the position of women workers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">COVERAGE OF VOLUNTARY BODIES, UNIONS AND GROUP TRAINING SCHEMES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to this legislation are an important part of this approach and set a new direction for the Affirmative Action Agency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has decided to retain the current threshold of 100 employees for an employer to be covered by the Act. Reducing the threshold at this stage of the legislation's life would divert resources from improving the quality of affirmative action reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Instead, the Agency will provide greater assistance and advice to smaller employers not covered by the Act on how to implement affirmative action programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Bill will remove some existing anomalies in coverage by extending the coverage of the legislation to voluntary bodies, union officials and group training schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extension of the Act to voluntary bodies, mainly large private schools and charities, will be particularly important as it means that an estimated 60,000 additional employees will benefit from the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AGENCY AS A STATUTORY BODY</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill changes the status of the Agency to that of a statutory authority. This proposal will give the Agency greater protection against the Opposition's intention to abolish the Agency. It also gives legal weight to the current relationship of the Agency to Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency is already located separately from the Department of Industrial Relations (DIR), and is directly accountable to the Minister. This has allowed the Agency to develop its own identity and high profile with its client groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By clarifying its legal status, the Government is cementing the independence and authority of the Agency, while still maintaining accountability to the Minister and this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DISCRETION TO VARY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A discretion to vary reporting requirements will be introduced in the Bill. This amendment will assist in improving the quality of affirmative action programs. It provides the Director of the Agency with the discretion to alter reporting requirements, or waive them for exceptional performers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such an approach requires the development of performance standards and benchmarks which can then provide the criteria for identifying those employers which have achieved best practice and exceeded expectations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather than impose these standards, a Tripartite Committee will be established to develop practical and reasonable standards which are adaptable to the diverse range of organisations covered by the Act. An immediate priority will be to focus on those steps in affirmative action programs which have had low levels of compliance, especially consultation with unions and employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of standards will improve the accountability of companies for their affirmative action programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will also allow the Agency to use the experience and expertise of high achieving companies for the benefit of other organisations. This will be complemented by the establishment of a program allowing employers to apply for grants to assist in developing best practice affirmative action programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of these amendments are part of this Government's wider program of positive reforms which recognise that women are a permanent and vital part of the Australian workforce and that they must be assured of a fair and satisfying working life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has a proud record of achievement in improving the position of women in the workforce. We have been responsible for providing women with legal redress under the Sex Discrimination Act and have ratified International Labour Organisation Convention 156 on Workers with Family Responsibilities, which makes it an aim of national policy to balance work and family life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Affirmative Action Act is an essential part of this strategy because it recognises that discrimination against women is not merely an individual matter which can be addressed on a case-by-case basis, but is part of our cultural, economic and industrial heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation is concerned with encouraging employers to remove the limitations imposed on women in a systematic and detailed way. This Bill will make the Act more effective and allow the agency to build on the achievements it has already made, particularly in the area of the quality of companies' affirmative action programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes introduced in the Bill will have no significant impact on Government expenditure.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1992. The schedule to this omnibus Bill contains amendments to various Acts, including the Bankruptcy Act 1966, the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981, the Family Law Act 1975, the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976, the Freedom of Information Act 1982, the Judges (Long Service Leave Payments) Act 1979, the Judges' Pensions Act 1968 and substantial amendments to the credit reporting provisions of the Privacy Act 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Bankruptcy Act arise from the early discharge system introduced in the Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1991. Under this system, as soon as a person has become a bankrupt, the trustee must send a notice to creditors stating the trustee's opinion as to whether the bankrupt is eligible for early discharge. Under the amendments in this Bill the trustee will also be required to notify the Official Receiver as to whether the bankrupt is eligible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition was concerned that further amendments to 31(1), paragraphs (c) and (da) would have the effect that annulments of bankruptcy and annulments in relation to compositions of creditors would not need to be heard in open court. We proposed amendments in the other place to ensure that they would and the Government accepted these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of concern to the coalition that in his second reading speech to this Bill the Minister refers to the requirement for consequential amendments arising from the Bankruptcy Act 1991 which were `inadvertently' not made by that Act. It is surely obvious that legislation is virtually certain to be flawed when the Government refuses to devote sufficient time to debate. In many cases Bills are dealt with under a guillotine in the other place and under pressure in this place, if not under a guillotine, owing to the enormous number of Bills we are expected to plough through in the last week of every session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this takes place because of the fact that the bulk of the Bills introduced into this place by the Government are introduced at the end of a session and not at the beginning so that we would then be able to plan some orderly consideration of these Bills. It means that the Government proposes shoddy, badly drafted legislation which we simply do not have the time to review properly. After all, that is the prime function of this place. Thus, we end up passing Bills one year and correcting their flaws the next, and then correcting the flaws in the amending legislation the following year. It would all be unnecessary if the proper time were given to it in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also makes minor amendments to the Family Law Act to allow a judge to resign a commission and accept a new one without loss of continuity. This amendment is also as a consequence of last year's mistake in the change made in the Family Law Amendment Act (No. 2) 1991, which extended the maximum retiring age for judges from 65 to 70 years. The amendment contained in this Bill will make it clear that, when the Government offers new commissions to those judges whose current terms of office are stated to end at age 65, there will be no doubt as to their continuity of office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also inserts a new subsection 37C which provides that a principal registrar, registrar or deputy registrar must take an oath or affirmation of office before the Chief Judge or a judge of the Family Court before commencing duty. The wording of this proposed oath is somewhat interesting. It requires the person to swear or affirm that they `will well and truly serve in the office of Registrar'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of contrast, the oath taken by judges of Commonwealth courts is not just an oath of office; it is one of allegiance to Her Majesty, the Queen of Australia, and her heirs and successors according to law. An oath of allegiance is also required of members of the Industrial Relations Commission and the registrars of the IRC and ACT Supreme Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We already know that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) would like to do away with the oath of allegiance for new citizens of this nation. Now it seems that the Government is trying to sneak a step on the road to republicanism by making the officers of the Family Court swear simply an oath of office rather than the traditional oath of loyalty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this cannot change the fact that Australia is a constitutional monarchy and any oath taken ought to be in the existing prescribed form. There is in any event&mdash;irrespective of your view or mine, Mr Acting Deputy President, as to whether we ought to be a republic or a constitutional monarchy&mdash;no reason why the oath taken by registrars of a court should be different from that taken by that court's judges. I foreshadow that on behalf of the Opposition I will be moving an amendment to change the oath of registrars to the traditional oath of loyalty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also amends the Federal Court Act of Australia 1976 to provide for an oath of office for the registrar, district registrar, deputy registrar or deputy district registrar of that court. I will be moving a similar amendment in respect of the proposed oath of office for registrars of the Federal Court so that it will include an oath of loyalty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are further amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act in relation to the amendments inserted last year to allow representative actions to be brought in the Federal Court. At the time the coalition was strongly opposed to the proposed structure of class actions whereby a person's consent is not required to become a party to the action. However, a person does have the choice of opting out of the proceedings by giving written notice to the court. We argued in favour of a system of opting in, whereby anyone wishing to be a part of representative proceedings would have to consent in writing before the commencement of the proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 43 of the Federal Court Act allows the court to award costs in proceedings. Proposed section 43(1A) in this Bill is designed to prevent the Federal Court awarding costs against a person represented in a representative proceeding which is brought under part IVA of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two exceptions where a court may order costs. The first is in paragraph (a), which provides for exceptions as authorised by section 33Q and 33R, where a group member is responsible for conducting a part of the proceedings. The second is in paragraph (b), which provides for exceptions when proceedings are commenced under another Act and a provision in that Act authorises an exception. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the general principle that a court should not be able to award costs against a person on whose behalf a proceeding has been commenced, especially since that person could have been joined in the action without their knowledge or consent. However, we believe there is scope for abuse. For example, relatively wealthy members of a class who are considering bringing an action could deliberately choose an impecunious representative party. Then, if the action is unsuccessful and it is only the representative party which or who can be liable for costs, the defendant will not be able to recover any costs. Therefore, we believe that the court should have a discretion in exceptional circumstances to award costs against persons on whose behalf a proceeding has been commenced. Obviously this would only apply when required in the interests of justice. I will be moving an amendment to the proposed section 43(1A) to provide that, in exceptional circumstances, a court may award costs against a person on whose behalf a representative proceeding has been commenced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also makes amendments to the credit reporting provisions of the Privacy Act 1988. The passage of the Privacy Amendment Act 1990, which introduced the regulation of the credit reference industry, was without doubt one of the most tortuous processes ever suffered in this chamber. I think I can say as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that it was even more so for that Committee. Indeed, had it not been for the then recently introduced procedures for the referral of Bills to committees, that is in this case the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, it is difficult to imagine how it would have been passed at all. As it was, the Government, the Opposition and the Democrats together moved about 100 amendments in the committee stage of the Bill. Then, after its eventual passage in December 1990, the Government was forced to further amend the Act and delay its implementation date, which was supposed to be September 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of the original debate in 1990, a question was raised by Corrs Australian Solicitors, now Corrs Chambers Westgarth, about the effects of the legislation on those involved in securitisation arrangements. It was obvious that further amendments would be required to provide adequately for these complex commercial schemes. A securitisation scheme involves a mortgage, ostensibly financed by a credit provider such as a building society, actually being financed by funds invested by investors in a trust. The trust is managed by a manager who deals with credit enhancers who have a role similar to mortgage insurers in that they take the financial risk by underwriting the securitisation scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Corrs Australian Solicitors pointed out that it would be detrimental to the securitisation industry if those parties behind the original credit provider were prevented from having access to credit reports. Under the provisions in this Bill, organisations involved in a securitisation arrangement will be deemed to be credit providers while they are involved in those arrangements, thereby giving them access in their own right to credit reports from credit reference agencies. Unlike other credit providers under the legislation, they will be able to disclose credit information to other members of the securitisation scheme without seeking the consent of the borrower. This recognises the commercial reality of such arrangements which could not operate effectively if each transfer between the bodies involved needed the consent of the borrower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another amendment to the Privacy Act, proposed paragraph 18N(bg), provides that a credit provider may disclose to a guarantor credit information relating to a borrower. The right of a guarantor to have access to credit information was another question which was much discussed at the time of the debate on the original legislation. I understand that the amendments to the Privacy Act have the support of the Privacy Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is supporting most of the provisions contained in this Bill. I will, however, be moving amendments to provide for an oath of loyalty, not merely an oath of office, for registrars of the Family and Federal courts to put them in line with the oaths taken by the judges of those courts and also an amendment to allow a Federal Court judge to award costs against a person who is party to representative proceedings in exceptional circumstances at the court's discretion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate tonight is discussing the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1992. It is an omnibus Bill proposing amendments of a minor policy nature to a number of Acts falling within the Attorney-General's portfolio. The major amendments proposed in this Bill are, firstly, to require the official receiver in bankruptcy to be included as a recipient of a trustee's notice to creditors of the bankrupt under subsection 19 (1B) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966. Under subsection 19(1B), such a notice must state whether, in the trustee's opinion, the bankrupt is eligible to apply for early discharge from bankruptcy. The purpose of this proposed amendment is to correct an oversight in the 1991 amendment to the Bankruptcy Act of not including the official receiver as a recipient of a trustee's notice. As stated by Senator McMullan in the second reading speech, this amendment will facilitate the administration of the review processes in relation to early discharge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment I would like to advert to is the one requiring registrars and deputy registrars of the Family and Federal courts to take an oath or affirmation of office before performing delegated judicial or quasi-judicial functions. It is interesting to note that these two proposed amendments do not require the registrars or deputy registrars to swear an oath of allegiance to the monarchy although the judges of those courts are obliged to do so. From listening to the previous speaker, it would appear that the Opposition thinks that this omission is yet another attack on the monarchy. I understand that the Opposition will be moving amendments which require the registrars and deputy registrars of the Federal and Family courts to swear an oath of allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen upon taking office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats see no reason for entering into a debate on the merits or otherwise of republicanism while debating this particular Bill that is before the Senate today. The simple answer lies in the fact that the vast majority of superior courts of record in Australia do not require their registrar or deputy registrar to swear an oath of allegiance to the monarchy when taking office. Among Australian supreme courts, the ACT Supreme Court is the only one to require its registrar to take an oath or affirmation swearing allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen. From this, it is overwhelmingly clear that other superior courts of record, apart from the Federal and Family courts, do not require their registrars or deputy registrars to swear an oath of allegiance to the monarchy when taking office. The Democrats can see no reason why one should depart from this practice and make that a requirement in this Bill of the registrars and deputy registrars of the Federal and Family courts. Accordingly, the Democrats will not be supporting the Opposition amendments on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third amendment I wish to address is the one which makes clear under the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 that, except in two circumstances, a person represented in a representative proceeding under part IVA of that Act or in a proceeding of a representative character authorised by another Act, such as the Trade Practices Act 1974, cannot be ordered to pay costs. One exception is where an individual member appears in a representative proceeding for the purpose of determining an issue that relates to his or her claim alone. The other is where a proceeding of a representative character is commenced under another Act and that Act authorises the ordering of costs. The second reading speech states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment reaffirms a long line of judicial authority which was said to be wrong in a recent judgment of the Supreme Court of Victoria in respect of statutory provisions in that State dealing with the power of that court to award costs.</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that the Opposition is concerned about this amendment because it argues that, as proposed subsection 43(1A) stands, there is the possibility that those choosing to be represented in a class action may deliberately choose an impecunious representative so that they can effectively be shielded behind that impecunious person in relation to an award for costs. The Opposition argues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these circumstances, if evidence is forthcoming to the court, the court should have the power nonetheless to make an order for costs which has some chance of being fulfilled.</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that the Opposition will be moving an amendment to cover a situation such as the one I have just outlined. However, two points need to be made. The first is that the chances of such a situation arising are very remote. Commencing a class action is very expensive and it would be highly unlikely that the representative would embark on it without making an appropriate cost sharing arrangement or obtaining indemnities from the other parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that the proposed amendment by the Opposition would have the practical effect of discouraging people from taking class actions because of the possibility of costs being awarded against them. This possibility sits at odds with the basic premise that class actions should encourage people to gain access to the law. On that basis, the Democrats will oppose the proposed Opposition amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth amendment that I wish to address relates to a range of miscellaneous amendments to the Freedom of Information Act, including an amendment to continue after the abolition of the National Companies and Securities Commission an exemption from applications under the Act for documents of the Commission that were exempt prior to that abolition. The current exemption provision in section 47 refers to documents which relate solely to the functions of the NCSC. I understand that only a relatively small number of documents fall within the terms of section 47. On this basis, the Australian Democrats accept the proposed amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next set of provisions that I wish to address relates to the mortgage securitisation industry under the Privacy Act 1988 so as to include asset-backed securitisation. The amendments will also deal with a number of problems and anomalies in the credit reporting provisions of the Privacy Act that have been brought to the Government's attention by industry representatives and the Privacy Commissioner. These include allowing credit providers to disclose credit information regulated by the Privacy Act to guarantors or would-be guarantors where the borrower has consented to the disclosure; permitting credit providers who have mortgages over the same property to share credit information where the borrower is more than 60 days in default; and allowing basic transaction information to be disclosed to a person who is authorised to operate an account that is in another person's name. These proposed amendments have the support of the Privacy Commissioner and have been prepared after consultations with interested parties. On that basis, the Australian Democrats will support them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that the Government has stated that the proposed amendments will not have any significant financial impact. As the consumer credit industry is already operating under the Privacy Act and because this Bill does not significantly require the industry to change its practices, the Government argues that there will be minimum direct cost impact on consumer credit reporting agencies and credit providers. The Democrats welcome the amendments contained in the Bill and regard the Bill as a constructive attempt to improve various pieces of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank those honourable senators who have contributed to the second reading debate on the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1992. The various matters which are dealt with in the Bill&mdash;there are quite a number of different areas: the Bankruptcy Act, the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act, the Family Law Act, the Federal Court of Australia Act, the Freedom of Information Act and the Judges' Pensions Act and so on&mdash;have been canvassed by myself earlier and by Senator Vanstone and Senator Spindler this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate has been presented with a number of matters which, in the main, are of a technical nature. There is one matter only that I want to mention more elaborately in the course of my response. It involves a most important provision that deals with the very difficult situation faced by guarantors or would-be guarantors in finding out about the credit position of those who are seeking to borrow money from some financial institution or by a person being approached to act as a guarantor and the guarantor, because of various blood ties or ties of an emotional character, not feeling able to press the point as to the very real risk or vulnerability to which he or she might be exposed. It has been put from time to time that credit providers themselves are unsure about how much information they can give to the guarantor in that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, along with Senator Vanstone, Senator Spindler and others, have had some heartbreaking cases in your electorate offices where those who have acted as guarantors have found that, quite literally, they have been conned and put under tremendous emotional pressure. I am not simply referring to what is called in the feminist jargon `STD'&mdash;sexually transmitted debt&mdash;situations but to other situations where long term friendships have been abused, even amongst business colleagues, for the purpose of extracting a guarantor and where the guarantor or would-be guarantor, in the initial contact with the bank, has not been properly informed as to the real financial situation of the borrower and, therefore, the guarantor might have been exposed to risk and vulnerability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The leading case that has been remarked on in many debates in this place is that of Sabby and Lyn Conn, an elderly immigrant couple who provided several guarantees and a mortgage to secure a number of business and personal loans for their son. Mr Conn was poorly educated and had little grasp of business matters and Mrs Conn had a long history of mental instability. Both were pensioners who clearly depended upon their bank manager for financial advice and guidance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new business was unsuccessful from the start. Despite being authorised by the son to disclose details of his accounts to his parents, the bank neglected to inform Mr and Mrs Conn of their son's poor financial state. Of course, the bank moved in and engaged in what was undoubtedly agreed at settlement to be unconscionable conduct in breach of section 52A of the Trade Practices Act. The Trade Practices Commission, on behalf of the Conns, issued legal proceedings against the bank to try to remedy this situation where these parents, in devotion to their son, had been led into a position where the bank could have disclosed the true circumstances but failed to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several cases such as that. I believe that the Privacy Act, which is extremely well intentioned, was passed by this Parliament in order to ensure that those who provide information to credit providers do not have that information made available to a wide range of persons. You will recall, Mr Deputy President, that during the debate on that Bill concern was expressed that, when we live in a credit ridden society, as we do, where everyone is dependent on access to credit and the ability to borrow funds, all borrowers&mdash;which means all of us&mdash;are in a very vulnerable position and that when we give information to a bank or a financial institution in order for it to assess whether we should be loaned certain money or monies we can, unless protected by law, be virtually compelled to allow the financial institution to make whatever use it wishes of the credit information that we may have to give to it. That may include passing on information to insurance agents or real estate agents and so on. So the Parliament did act, but I do not believe that it ever intended to act in a way which would prevent guarantors from being made aware of the borrower's financial status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before the Senate tonight attempts to deal with that situation by providing in very broad terms that, where a situation such as this is impending, the guarantor, with the consent of the borrower, is entitled to have the consumer credit worthiness of the borrower exposed by the financial institution to the guarantor or would-be guarantor. This follows a recommendation of the Martin committee report. The Bill takes into legislative form that recommendation. I hope that assists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were some matters raised by honourable senators more or less by way of foreshadowing amendments to be moved by the Opposition principally in relation to this particular Bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take the third amendment first, which relates to the fact that in representative proceedings, known colloquially as class actions, under the Federal Court of Australia Act the Opposition intends to create a situation where the judge may exercise a discretion, in what the Opposition terms `exceptional circumstances', to allow costs to be awarded against those who are represented before the court, not just the representative party. This was considered during the drafting of the original Bill now containing those provisions in the Federal Court of Australia Act establishing this representative proceeding. It has to be understood that the normal cost rules apply&mdash;that is, the unsuccessful party would normally be ordered to pay the party-party costs of the successful party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Vanstone raises the very good point about the problem of the impecunious representative party perhaps being deliberately selected so that if the representative action is lost the defendant does not have anybody of substance against whom to claim the costs. This was dealt with by seeing the whole context of the Federal Court of Australia Act, into which our representative action was placed. It was expressly provided in the Bill&mdash;in 33ZJC(5)&mdash;that nothing in that representative proceeding affects the operation of any law relating to security for costs. The court may make an order for security for costs on the same basis as in any other proceeding. When we look at section 56 of the Federal Court of Australia Act we find the main power to order security for costs. I will read it because that may satisfy Senator Vanstone as to why we are not accepting the proposed amendment. Section 56 provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Court or a Judge may order an applicant in a proceeding in the Court or an appellant in an appeal to the Court to give security for the payment of costs that may be awarded against him.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The security shall be of such amount, and given at such time and in such manner and form, as the Court or Judge directs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Court or a Judge may reduce or increase the amount of security ordered to be given and may vary the time at which, or manner or form in which, the security is to be given.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If security, or further security, is not given in accordance with an order under this section, the Court or a Judge may order that the proceeding or appeal be dismissed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This section does not affect the operation of any provision made by or under any other Act or by the Rules of Court for or in relation to the furnishing of security.</PARA>
<PARA>Basically, there is adequate provision within the Act as it stands to allow for the court to satisfy itself that a defendant will be in a position to be able to recover costs if the plaintiff's case is lost. I believe that the court, by exercising that power, would be able to ensure that no defendant is left in the situation which Senator Vanstone feared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also the case that the court has a power to order security for costs. The court's powers in relation to a proceeding in which no reasonable cause of action is disclosed, or that is oppressive, vexatious, frivolous or an abuse of the process of the court, are specifically preserved in the Act too. Quite simply, I believe that there is sufficient power in the Federal Court to ensure that there is no abuse of process and that the defendant in the situation envisaged by Senator Vanstone is able to recover costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendments moved by the Opposition relate to what is proposed by way of a formal statement&mdash;to put it in neutral terminology for the moment&mdash;by registrars who have the power to exercise delegated judicial functions. What is intended by the Bill is that some indication of independence from the Executive is to be assumed by the fact that such a giving of an oath will be required. The oath that is proposed is in the form of an oath to the court. It is not an oath of allegiance such as judges take before commencing duty. A judge swears an oath to the court as well as an oath to be faithful and bear true allegiance to the Queen. The registrar will swear to well and truly serve in the office of registrar of the court and to do right by all manner of people according to law without fear of favour, affection or ill-will. It is believed that that is a sufficient and adequate formal statement of the role which ought to be recognised of registrars as they exercise their delegated judicial or quasi-judicial functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that what is required is that registrars act fairly when performing those delegated judicial functions. The terminology which is provided for in this Bill gives a sufficient and adequate foundation to the sort of undertaking which ought to be given and which is required by the community for those exercising such powers. It is not thought that the oath of allegiance in the form suggested by the Opposition is necessary for those exercising these sorts of powers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The package of Bills that we are dealing with tonight covers a range of topics. I think it is fair to say that the Bill dealing with part 7 of the Broadcasting Services Act&mdash;that is, relating to subscription television services&mdash;is certainly the most important of those.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I would like very quickly to run through the coalition's position in relation to each of the pieces of legislation. The Radiocommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1992 repeals frequency reservation certificates and temporary permits, which will no longer be required under the new radio communications licensing scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The radiocommunications tax amendment Bills contain a package of amendments dealing with taxation matters. These amendments are consequential upon the Radiocommunications Bill 1992, which establishes a spectrum management agency to determine all such taxes. The determinations are disallowable instruments. We support each of those Bills. We do not regard them as contentious but as simply necessary parts of the rationalisation of spectrum management and the manner in which the issue of entitlements of access to networks should be made available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept behind the Radiocommunications Act 1983 is one that has been in place for a number of years. The 1992 Bill reforms the management of the radio frequency spectrum as originally outlined in that 1983 legislation. A public inquiry was undertaken by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. As a result of the report of the Committee, the Bill aims to establish a more efficient allocation and use of the spectrum in a rapidly changing communications environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we are all aware of the rapid convergence of technology in this area and the great difficulty that regulators can have in seeking to impose boundaries which in many respects can become artificial very quickly. The challenge in many respects has been for the law to keep up with practice. Therefore, in seeking progressively to introduce a market system of spectrum management in defined spectrum bands alongside the existing administrative system, we are hopefully on the way to a more rational use of resources and a more flexible method of determining access to the spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of a spectrum management agency, as proposed in the Bill, is also a very necessary development. The radio frequency spectrum is under the control of two primary agencies. The ABA, under the Broadcasting Services Act, will continue to plan the broadcasting services bands located in parts of the AM, FM, VHF and UHF frequencies. The rest of the spectrum will come under the aegis of the Radiocommunications Act and, specifically, the spectrum management agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal for a market-based allocation of spectrum is a step in the right direction. Reform is limited in speed and scope, both by the physical characteristics of various parts of the spectrum and the time and resources required for negotiating conversion with incumbents and planning and packaging the unencumbered spectrum to suit the market. Its introduction will occur selectively and progressively under the control of the Minister who will designate those parts of the spectrum suitable for marketplace services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We therefore support the Bill but express some reservations as to whether the structures will provide for emerging technologies and services in the most desirable and effective manner. At this stage of the process we take the view that it certainly is a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1992 allows for the ABC to carry corporate sponsorship and promotional material on its new international satellite services to South East Asia. We support that amendment to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act. The legislation also makes it a reasonable excuse for a journalist at an ABA hearing to refuse to answer a question or produce a document if, to do so, would disclose a confidential source of material used in a broadcasting program. We do have concerns in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, it has been the practice of the common law for very many years that journalists should not be immune from disclosing the sources of their information. Indeed, it is a very necessary part of keeping the system open and honest that people are required to disclose their sources. To the extent that this makes an exception in relation to the ABA hearings, we will certainly be following it closely to ensure that there are no suggestions of abuse of process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We concede that there may be circumstances in which it is a reasonable excuse to refuse to answer a question. But we are very concerned that, taken at its fullest, it may provide opportunities for people to avoid disclosing sources in situations where it may well be desirable in the public interest that people are held directly accountable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1991 allow agreements between carriers about interconnection to more than two carriers. They extend the protection of communications to suppliers and former suppliers, establish a telecommunications industry ombudsman and ensure that carriers retain the reserve right to install or maintain line links between distinct places. Each of those amendments is a step forward. We think these are a set of encouraging developments in terms of ensuring that we keep up to date with technological progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn briefly to the Bill which effectively reintroduces pay television&mdash;the Broadcasting Services (Subscription Television Broadcasting) Amendment Bill 1992. The Bill does contain a number of key changes from the original proposed part 7. It does follow on from the report of the Senate select committee to the extent that it specifies a role for the Australian Broadcasting Commission. It adopts the recommendation of the Committee. To the extent that it mandates compressed digital technology, it does not. It also requires that 10 national channels be made available but no more until 1 July 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We express our concerns about the extent to which there may be significant limitations upon competition as a result of that decision to limit pay television effectively to three licence holders for the next five years. Despite the fact that we are commencing with digital technology, it has been the view of Optus, which made an amended submission to the select committee, that one would be looking at anything from the availability of 24 to 48 channels as a result of the introduction of digital technology. In those circumstances it is an artificial limitation to provide that only 10 should be available in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We therefore regard the model as significantly flawed in limiting the choice of technology by confining licensees to carriage by Optus, making artificial distinctions between broadcast and narrowcast, concentrating on supply in the number of channels rather than on demand, and being uncompetitive by imposing severe ownership restrictions on the A licence, which is confined to new entrants, but few on the B licence for existing free to air operators, and by enabling vertical integration and risking the emergence of only one operator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are still some very substantial question marks over the whole concept of pay television. We are loath to hold up the process any longer, given that we have now been dithering in this area for something like 12 years. We are not in any way impressed by the suggestions made from time to time by the Minister that thousands of new jobs are just around the corner as a result of the introduction of pay television. It is more important to get it right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But to the extent that this Bill does propose a model which may well be viable, at least in the short term, and which does not deprive us of the opportunity to make any significant amendments in due course after the next election to open up the system to much greater competitive pressures, then we take the view that it ought to proceed at this stage. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We regard it as very important that we have managed to achieve a role for the ABC in the satellite delivery of pay television. We are also encouraged that the Trade Practices Commission is embedded in the Act. We would like to see that go further so that the TPC at all stages has a vital role to play not only in ensuring that there is competition between licensees but even to the extent of ensuring that there are no collusive practices between those who might jointly bid for a licence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of common customer reception equipment for satellite pay television is certainly important, as are codes of practice relating to the billing, fault repair, privacy and credit management for satellite pay television. A contents standard amendment relating to R rated material on satellite pay television is also important. We will take that a step further in relation to free to air during the committee stage. So, although the current model is a fairly second best outcome, we take the view that it is better than no model at all and that it therefore ought to be allowed to proceed at this stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats do not believe this is a second best model. At this stage we believe it is about a fifth or sixth best model. We are still very unhappy with it. This has been discussed many times before in this chamber and nothing very much has changed since the last time we discussed it. The difference with this model is that the ABC has been given two channels, if it wants them, rather than the one that it had last time. All our previous objections remain. Cross-media involvement has not improved in this model. We still have the second licence holder able to come from the current free to air or any other media owners in Australia. We still do not believe that the ABC is able viably to participate in this model. Although Australian program content is set at 10 per cent, we think it is too low. We would like to see it start at 20 per cent. We still believe that exclusivity periods are necessary if we are to have a viable model in the first place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation proposes a two-licence model with the ABC tacked on. Each of the main licences has four channels and the ABC has two. The ABC is supposed to do a deal with one of the major licence holders to be carried as part of a package deal on subscription if it can. I doubt very much whether it can. Then it has to compete as a third offering to consumers. The likely make-up of the licences would be a movie channel, a sports channel, a news channel and one light entertainment channel in a four-channel package. It is expected to cost about $40 a month to subscribe, based on overseas experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC is expected to offer a news channel and one other, probably a light entertainment channel, music channel, children's channel or a combination of all three. Most consumers are unlikely to be interested in paying extra money to replicate parts of the four-channel package that they already have, even if it would give them much better news and current affairs, which it would. Unless the ABC signs a deal with a major licence holder it will most probably be cut out of the market or be forced to underprice itself considerably. If I were the ABC, I would not even bother with this one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The holder of licence B would be allowed to have a consortium, including current free to air broadcasters. This is one of our major problems with this Bill. The Bill provides protection for current free to air services via bans on the carriage of advertising until 1997, plus participation in the second and subsequent licences. The Bill explicitly relies on section 50 of the Trade Practices Act to control market dominance. But we note that section 50 of the Trade Practices Act did not stop newspaper or television aggregation, did not stop bank mergers, and did not stop the two major airlines squeezing out Compass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that the current media players should not be allowed to participate in pay television at least for the first couple of years and that cross-media ownership rules should apply equally to both licences A and B. After 1997 there is to be a free for all for single channel licences, as many as Optus wishes to make available, and no restrictions placed on licence holders. Current licence holders A and B, as they will be after this Bill comes into effect, can buy up what they like. There are no provisions for consumer protection during or after the ensuing bidding war or if one prices the rest out of the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian consumers and potential industry participants are entitled to express outrage about their part in this Bill. It completely ignores the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Subscription Television Broadcasting Services and to a large extent disregards the findings of expensive fact finding missions undertaken by the Department and previous Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current proposal does not ensure an adequate start-up period to allow Australian manufacturing to begin production of hardware in time to profitably meet demand. In order to meet the licensing provisions, both licence holders would be forced to begin broadcasting before there were enough Australian made dishes and decoders available. Australian manufacturers would not merely be forced to compete with foreign imports from the start; they would be disadvantaged in the marketplace because ready-made imports would already be here before they were up and running. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also believe that the Government has failed in its attempts to set up an accessible if not a level playing field. Provisions which allow the first two licence holders to decree the technology standard to be used should oblige them to consult with Optus or Austel and be mindful of any international standard. Other transponder capacity will almost certainly be used for other communications purposes, including data transference systems, which require the use of a monitor such as a TV set or a computer screen. There is no reason why the same decoder hardware could not be used for TV and other purposes as well. An arbitrary decision by two self-interested players who are being given the opportunity to limit their future competitors will create add-on expenses for consumers in the future and will severely curtail the potential for telecommunications expansion in the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult to decide which is the most glaring area of belligerent policy making here&mdash;the lack of adequate enhancement for Australian industry participation or the level of Australian program content to be required for predominantly drama channels. The Bill imposes a 10 per cent Australian program content level despite all of the Committee witnesses, including potential bidders, saying that they thought 15 per cent or more was appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister states in his speech that setting the level higher than 10 per cent would be an unnecessary financial burden. We do not believe that. One of the amendments that I will be moving in the committee stage puts it up to 20 per cent. I hope we get support from both sides, or at least one side, for that. Another of the amendments, which I have more hope for, would allow the ABA after five years to look at whether the local program content should be increased by 5 per cent or more. I think that one might have a bit of support somewhere. I hope so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All witnesses before the Senate inquiry suggested higher levels of independent Australian production were not only attainable but also highly desirable. Not one of the potential bidders expressed the view that higher levels would amount to an unnecessary financial impost. The Democrats have moved several amendments. We hope they will redress some of the major problem that we see in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very disappointed that after so long, and after so much assistance from many experts in the community as well as from the Opposition and the Democrats, the Government has offered Australian consumers and business only the personal prejudices of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this second reading debate on the general communications Bills, I want to confine my remarks to those aspects of the Broadcasting Services (Subscription Television Broadcasting) Amendment Bill 1992 which relate to the introduction of pay television in this country. Perhaps for the last time&mdash;at least the last time this year&mdash;I place on record my view that the model which has finally been arrived at by the Government, largely through imposition by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), for pay television in this country is a model in which I have little confidence. I believe it will not serve well either the Australian consumers or any section of Australian industry with an interest in the area of subscription television.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we see in the legislation before us today is a subscription television system which is as close as one could have expected the Government to have come to Opposition policy. It is a process of open slather by which the licences to be allocated will be allocated in a market which is uncertain and into which the present media players will be able to move at the same time as a new licensee is being encouraged to come in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bourne has referred to the great body of information and expertise that has been brought to bear on this policy area over many years. Overseas experience has shown that this is a very difficult area in which there have been commercial disasters. Those commercial disasters have impacted on household consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that people are not marching in the streets for pay television in this country, even though pay television has been a matter of debate for inordinate hours  in this chamber during the course of this year. The people out there are not overly concerned about this question. If they are, they are nonplussed about the costs involved&mdash;assuming that they can afford them&mdash;about the insecurities, and the fact that they will probably be getting more of the same. I think it is almost inevitable that once this model is put in place there will be repercussions in the market and that Australian consumers will be the losers along the way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the Labor Party had a policy of not introducing pay television to this country. That policy was changed not because of marketplace demand, but because this Government needed a carrot to dangle before the nose of the potential purchasers of the millstone around the Government's neck represented by the Aussat satellite. In introducing competition to Telecom, Aussat was sold to Optus Communications. Subscription television by a satellite monopoly was the carrot: hence this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In persuading the Labor Party Caucus to lift the moratorium on pay television, several promises were made. The  first was that pay television would provide an opportunity for more diverse ownership of media in this country. This is an interesting promise from a government under whose care the monopolisation of media ownership in this country has reached stunning heights. So I suppose it might have been attractive to believe that new players, or even one new player, might come into the media scene via pay television. The model we have before us today, which allows present media players in at the same time as this potential new operator, means that the odds are that, presently, the operators will be the ones who will win out in the marketplace in which this new industry will be operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A second carrot for the Caucus was that the introduction of pay television would give a boost to both the production industry and the manufacturing industry in this country; that this country could get into a whole new area; that we could become exporters of relevant manufactured products, particularly into the Asian region; and that there would be more product needed and therefore more Australian production. Senator Bourne has referred to the fact that this legislation allows a disappointing 10 per cent of Australian content provisions on drama channels only. That is not adequate and will certainly not provide the impetus for increased Australian production. The recommendation of the Select Committee on Subscription Television Broadcasting Services should have been followed at least in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the manufacturing industry, the Committee heard, as the public has heard often enough, from manufacturers in this country saying that, unless a viable system was put forward, they would not, and could not, be interested in tooling up for a whole new industry that they could not be certain would survive. So there is an enormous question mark over that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third promise was that Australian consumers would benefit&mdash;that there would be increased diversity of programming; greater access to material that the public currently does not have; and that it would enhance the culture, entertainment and general viewing of Australian consumers. The problem there is that first there are no guarantees of this&mdash;there never are; and, secondly, if we leave aside the esoteric argument about the fact that we all pay for advertising and therefore free-to-air is not really free, consumers of free-to-air television compared with subscription television consumers stand to lose quite considerably by this package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we can anticipate, the commercial pressures are very strong and there are risks that pay TV simply will not pay the providers. Obviously there will be pressure on this Government, the next government and succeeding governments to eat away at some of the safeguards that are in the legislation, and they are few enough, against the siphoning off of major events, major programming, to the subscription area so that free-to-air viewers&mdash;those who cannot afford $40, $50 or $60, or however many dollars a week they may have to pay to get all these programs through subscription television&mdash;will be deprived. Those who do pay will be deprived if it is not a commercially viable system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, on all counts I think that the Caucus of the Labor Party in government has been sold a pup on this one, to say the least. It has been a surprise, and a disappointment, to me that the previously strong Caucus committee on transport and communications has not stood firmer on this throughout the whole process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has always wanted a system which would be open&mdash;in other words, the more the merrier, and letting the market determine what happens. As I have suggested in my remarks so far, the inevitable consequence of that&mdash;and we should have learnt the lesson from the UK, which is a much bigger market&mdash;is that in that sort of market even two players could not survive. There is also the experience in New Zealand and elsewhere around the world. So I cannot understand how we can expect to survive in this small, and at this moment quite depressed, market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is an unsatisfactory package in almost every way and I believe that it is a package that should be rejected. I guess it will go through the Parliament, however, with the support of the Opposition because, once again, as I say, we are seeing the Labor Party in government do the work of the conservative coalition parties in yet another policy area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to make a few remarks about one issue that has been raised recently in the debate surrounding broadcasting policy in this country. It will be the subject, I am sure, of more debate in the chamber this evening as amendments which are being foreshadowed around the chamber are debated. The issue concerns the classifications of material viewed on television and on pay television as well. Amendments will be moved during the committee stage and I would like to say a few words now and, hopefully, not contribute to what may be an extended committee debate, if my judgment is anything to go by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we all agree with statements that have been recently made by the Prime Minister with regard to the level of violence on television and the need for the classification systems to be changed, to be unified across the various forms of video film and television material and to take more account of the depiction of violence. The various classifications need to be uniform and agreed and children, in particular, should be protected from inappropriate viewing. The Prime Minister has made these points and he has been supported in making those points by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is obvious, and one would agree, that they reflect the views that are widespread in the community. Senator Lees has made those remarks too in a recent debate on behalf of the Democrats, and others in this chamber have also done so. Of course, the levels of violence in viewing are unacceptable in many cases. I am sure we all want to work towards alleviating that situation. The issue of violence in the context of the family was further raised by the Prime Minister in a speech at a conference on family issues here in this building just over a week ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to make one point tonight&mdash;that this is not something that has newly been raised. I have in the chamber with me tonight the report of the National Committee on Violence that came down in 1990 which made certain observations about violence within the family. I will read one of them now. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Victims of violence most commonly tend to fall into two broad categories: men who become engaged in altercations with other men; and women and children who suffer at the hands of men with whom they have been living.</PARA>
<PARA>That Committee went on to recommend a whole series of very strict regulations in the area of gun control. More recently, the National Committee on Violence Against Women in October this year released its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The national strategy on violence against women</EMPHASIS>. In that report, the availability of guns in the home having been identified as clearly a significant factor in violence against women, the following recommendation is made:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Continue working towards stricter, uniform firearms legislation, establishing a national register of gun owners, and banning military style, semi-automatic weapons; as well as promoting the knowledge that guns kill people rather than protect people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislate against guns being allowed in domestic households.</PARA>
<PARA>The point I want to make is that it is good to hear political leaders expressing their concern about violence&mdash;about depiction of violence, about the effects of violence and depictions of violence on our young people&mdash;and, further, to hear them express their concerns about family life and the safety of, particularly, children in the family context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be more impressed if I could see more evidence of the implementation of, certainly, the 1990 Committee report. I am conscious that the Federal Government is reliant in this area very much on cooperation at State level. I will look forward to speedy action on the recommendations that are contained in the recent report of the National Committee on Violence Against Women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there may be time and energy, and even emotion, expended in the debate as it goes on tonight about depictions of violence in the electronic media, it is also important to tackle in a very practical way some of the very well and quite long-identified issues which can make a marked difference to the real experience of violence, particularly in families in households in our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am conscious of the presence in Australia at this time of the leader of the US gun lobby. I simply make the point in this debate that there are other practical things that we can do to reduce the incidence of violence in our community. I think the Broadcasting Services (Subscription Television Broadcasting) Amendment Bill puts forward an inadequate package and I believe this legislation should be opposed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take a few minutes to respond to remarks made by the Queensland Treasurer, Mr De Lacy, in the Queensland Parliament last week. The Queensland Treasurer has given a detailed and lengthy speech in reply to my earlier speech on the adjournment regarding public sector superannuation in that State. I wish to place on record the appreciation for the complimentary remarks that Mr De Lacy made about the work of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. In fact, Mr De Lacy said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not know what more can be done to assure any critic that full actuarial funding of the Government's schemes is being maintained.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps Mr De Lacy could publish the 1985 actuarial report,  the recent actuarial report on the police fund as well as any other independent audit report. Then he would be in a position to truly convince the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation that his Queensland superannuation schemes are fully funded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr De Lacy's letter to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, following its third report, admits that fully funded superannuation does not occur and that Queensland is no different from the Commonwealth and other States that admit a superannuation liability. I seek leave of the Senate to table the letter to the Senate Select Committee from the Treasurer of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr De Lacy's letter to the Chairman of the Committee reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard, the Queensland Government's superannuation schemes are operated in the same way as the schemes operated by the Commonwealth and the other States. The component of emerging benefits which is funded by the Crown, as employer, is paid to the Superannuation Fund at the time payment is made from the Fund to the beneficiary.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there is an emerging debt, not a separate fund to cover all liabilities. Mr De Lacy should now have his Treasury officials calculate the emerging benefits that will need to be paid over the next 20 to 30 years to each of his employees and past employees who are already in receipt of retirement benefits, just as the other governments around Australia have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this has occurred, and it has the stamp of an actuary and the seal of an auditor, we will have a figure of unfunded liabilities for public sector superannuation in Queensland. Mr De Lacy has also remarked that, unlike private sector employees, his State receives no taxation relief for providing superannuation schemes. That is an extraordinary statement. However, he admits that the States do not pay taxation on earnings made from investments or consolidated revenue funds, nor do they have to fully fund their defined benefits schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr De Lacy has the temerity to question private sector superannuation schemes in his less than generous comments in the Queensland Parliament and in his letter to the Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation when he says, in identical words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nor do the States, unlike the Commonwealth, have the opportunity to reduce the cost of their superannuation through social security or income tax clawbacks.</PARA>
<PARA>I remind Mr De Lacy that the private sector would indeed be happy to change positions. By virtue of being paid into the consolidated revenue fund, his so-called arrangements escape both the employers contribution tax and the earnings tax of other superannuation funds because the income in his case is derived from an exempt source, which is the consolidated revenue fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr De Lacy's letter is not only contradictory, but also  his assertions lead thinking Australians to question his claims and, unfortunately, the professional training of his advisers that he sends on Government errands to public Federal parliamentary inquiries to convey false impressions such that his superannuation funds are fully funded schemes. I would welcome Mr De Lacy's response to each of the points that I have submitted and sustained this evening. I thank the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support the comments made by my colleague Senator Watson in relation to the superannuation funds that are held by the State Government in Queensland. The cause of my concern is very simple and is as follows. When the senior officers of the Queensland Government, senior representatives of the superannuation funds and of the Queensland Investment Corporation appeared before the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, they stated categorically that the superannuation funds in Queensland, in respect of both employee and employer contributions, were fully funded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of weeks after that date, however, the Queensland Treasurer admitted in Parliament that at least the defined benefits fund available for the police force was not funded at all. Clearly we have a case of senior public servants, wittingly or unwillingly, misleading a Senate inquiry. I know that Mr De Lacy has attempted to excuse these rather frightening errors, but his explanation creates more holes than it plugs. It is, as Senator Watson says, quite contradictory. But clearly, on the basis of what Mr De Lacy told the State Parliament in Queensland, the evidence that was provided by the senior departmental officers and senior officers of the government superannuation funds in the Queensland Investment Corporation was incorrect. In other words, the Senate inquiry was, wittingly or otherwise, misled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now find Mr De Lacy, in his letter to the Chairman of the Committee, yet again attempting to obfuscate the problems that exist. Senator Watson has correctly pointed out that, whilst Mr De Lacy begs poor about not getting a tax benefit for contributing to the fund, the State Government in Queensland is not being obliged to pay tax on its earnings, nor on the contributions. As Senator Watson quite correctly says, many Queensland or Australian companies would gladly swap places with the Queensland Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is, of course, that the number of public servants in Queensland is increasing at a dramatic rate. If it continues at this rate, even if the State Government funds are fully funded, there will come a time&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very difficult, Senator Watson; one really has to have a mind as twisted as Mr De Lacy's. If the number of public servants continues to increase at the current rate, even if the funds are fully funded at the moment&mdash;or rather that the obligations are fully funded because there is no fund&mdash;then there will come a time when the obligations are not fully funded. I believe that point in time could be very, very close if it has not already reached us. Therefore, I believe that it is absolutely important that Mr De Lacy does as Senator Watson has suggested; that is, have a full actuarial report on the State Government's obligations and whether in fact they can be met out of the consolidated fund, as Mr De Lacy has suggested.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the adjournment debate, I was giving the history of the reason for my amendment to the Broadcasting Services (Subscription Television Broadcasting) Amendment Bill. As I said, in 1988 I presented to the Senate a private member's Bill, one of the purposes of which was to downgrade the violence in videos and films. At that stage it became coalition policy that violence should be downgraded for the viewing public. That Bill was defeated by the Government and by the Democrats at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Just a couple of months ago, in September of this year, I reintroduced a similar Bill, but that Bill was to lie on the table for public discussion. Public discussion did take place, even though it was only from September until early November, and 22,000 signatures were presented to the Parliament. I think Mr Keating then looked at the number of people who were so concerned about the amount of violence that we see, both on television and on films and videos, and he thought it would be a good idea to join the bandwagon. So Mr Keating is a Johnny-come-lately to the concern shown by the community on the amount of violence it is seeing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A short while ago the Prime Minister made a speech to the Family Summit here in Canberra in which he made his view very clear. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not trying to restrict what adults can watch.</PARA>
<PARA>He made it very clear that his view was that only children should not be watching the violence. He made his views well known because he said he went home and had to turn off the television because his young children were watching a violent AO film. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister then came up with a wonderful suggestion. I am quite sure that the media all thought that this was something new. He suggested that the category M be divided. In his speech to the Family Summit he said that M was a very broad category and it should be divided into M-plus and M-minus so that the less violent or sexually explicit sections of the M classification are divided from the more minor classifications of that grading. What he did not say was that he was picking up a recommendation made by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must be reminded that the M category is presently not allowed on television. Only AO is allowed on television and it is a lesser category than M. I will read the recommendation made by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We propose that, for the purposes of television broadcasts of M classified material under self-regulation, broadcasters adopt a system which splits the M classification into two categories, with the milder material in the lower M range being equated to the current AO classification and thus able to be shown from 8.30, and that material in the M classification which includes stronger depictions of sex, violence or coarse language be restricted to broadcasting in an unmodified form only after 10.30. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what the Prime Minister has suggested and he made it sound like it was something new coming from him. It did not ever come from him. It was a recommendation from the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. He has literally pinched this suggestion and made it as if it came from him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be clearly understood that M-rated material is not permitted on television, but the ABT is recommending that only the lower categories of the M classification should be shown on television at 8.30 and the stronger depictions should be shown only at 10.30. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a violent reaction from commercial television stations to the Prime Minister's suggestion that AO material be moved to 9.30 and not shown before that time. They frankly told him to go jump in the lake. They thumbed their noses at him and said they would not abide by it. We all know that self-regulation is part of the Australian decision. It was a bipartisan agreement at that stage that they should be able to self-regulate, and they have abused that self-regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that commercial television stations owe a responsibility to the community. It is extremely clear from the latest inquiry by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal that people have told it time and time again&mdash;and in large numbers&mdash;that they do not want as much violence on television. They have put to the ABT many times that the time slot should be pushed back further. The television stations have not accepted that. I believe their responsibility to the community is to accept it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know from the various surveys which have been undertaken that 35 per cent of children are still viewing at 8.30 and, if the commercial television stations believe, as they say they do, that parents should be the sole people in charge of children's viewing, then the commercial television stations are not abiding by what actually occurs in the community at the moment. As I said, up to 35 per cent of children are still viewing television at 8.30 at night. It is for these reasons that I will be moving my amendment later in the committee stage of this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The eight Bills we are debating this evening relating to broadcasting services, radiocommunications and transport and communications issues generally have some positive aspects to them. However, there are also several unsatisfactory aspects as far as the Opposition is concerned, particularly with regard to the Broadcasting Services (Subscription Television Broadcasting) Amendment Bill 1992, which is the subject of the second reading amendment moved by my colleague Senator Alston a few moments ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill reintroduces part 7 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 which relates to pay television. As senators would be aware, at the request of the Opposition, part 7 was referred to a Senate Select Committee in late June for a detailed inquiry. During that inquiry the Committee unsuccessfully attempted to seek resolution on two key issues: firstly, the when and how of pay TV service licences being issued and, secondly, how the Australian Broadcasting Corporation would be best placed to operate within that industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unanimity was achieved only in respect of the role of the ABC in subscription television and there was little agreement on anything else before that Committee. In fact, the Committee reported on the basis that analog technology, which required a restriction to only six channels, would be used for pay television in Australia. We now know that that technology has been surpassed by the digital compression technology. That is in part reflected in the Bill before us today which reflects several major changes to the original legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, as I said, it mandates compressed digital technology with a standard to be agreed by licensees A and B and set by the Minister in consultation with Optus Communications. Secondly, it provides that there be 10 national channels until 1 July, after which time single channel licences may be issued, subject to the Trade Practices Act. Within that licensees A and B will provide up to four channels each and licence C is to be issued free to the ABC and SBS, individually, as part of a consortium or in strategic alliances with licensee A or licensee B to provide up to two fully commercial services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Non-satellite licences will have no cross-media limits and will be subject to the Trade Practices Act and licensees will be free to operate their own subscriber management system, but will be required to provide fair access for other satellite licensees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition believes that this Bill as presented this evening is fundamentally flawed. The main reason for that flaw is that it limits the options of technology by confining licensees to carriage by Optus. Further, it makes artificial distinctions between broadcast and narrowcast. The essence of the shortcomings of this legislation is that it concentrates on supply, that is, the number of channels, rather than market demand, that is, the size of the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the Bill artificially limits the availability to 10 channels when, with the technology that is now to be applied, 24 channels would be quite feasible. The legislation is short on providing competition in two key areas. Firstly, it imposes strict ownership restrictions on licence A, but few on licence B. Secondly, it enables vertical consolidation and risks the emergence of one operator. Further, it restricts the diversity of programming in its interconnector arrangements by not providing for multiple program providers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that under this legislation the industry could reasonably expect significant shifts in employment, stimulating manufacturing and program production growth as well as realising some export potential. Because of those positive aspects to the legislation, we will not oppose it. However, we will, as Senator Alston has already indicated, be moving a second reading amendment and will also be moving specific amendments in the committee stage to seek a more balanced presentation of the pay television scenario, particularly with regard to advertising on pay television, the involvement of the Trade Practices Commission in the allocation of the A and B licences and the institution of modifications to the standard setting procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties' preferred model for the introduction of pay television seeks to promote and support the concept, but in a much more competitive environment and with a much more competitive spirit than is offered by this legislation. The area we believe is the major shortcoming for this particular Bill is that it does not provide adequate competition with regard to pay television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the other particular Bill to which I wish to refer this evening, the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill, there are two areas which concern the Opposition. This Bill primarily deals with the technical aspects of transport and communications and seeks to clarify diverse provisions of various Acts administered under this portfolio. We have particular concern about the provision whereby journalists will enjoy special privileges when appearing before the Australian Broadcasting Authority. It is the view of the Liberal and National parties that journalists should be treated in exactly the same manner as other individuals who may appear before any authority hearing. Therefore, we have severe reservations about that aspect of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other concern we have is with regard to category four of the amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1991: the rules relating to the general carriers reserved rights. The purpose of this is to ensure that carriers retain the reserve right to install or maintain line links between distinct places and to ensure that the accepted line links allowed under the Act revert to their original purpose if title passes to another person. This category four amendment is specifically detrimental to the Liberal Government of New South Wales, which has recently established its own telecommunications system for government communications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That initiative, in its limited form which is allowed by the legislation, alone will save the New South Wales taxpayer $28m per annum over the next 10 years. Such initiatives have no right to be thwarted by this Government. In fact, the legislation as presented to this chamber seeks to prevent the New South Wales Government from further extending this worthwhile initiative which it has taken and merely seeks to reserve the right to existing carriers to keep extra revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is strongly opposed to this maintenance of a duopoly until 1997 when the New South Wales Government will attain separate carrier status at any rate. We believe that there ought to be strong and open competition in telecommunications now and that this should not be delayed until 1997. The country should be working towards developing the optimum telecommunications network for its needs as we approach the twenty-first century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final issue I wish to raise in this debate this evening is the incorporation into this legislation of an amendment which, in the light of the High Court's decision with regard to the legislation banning TV advertising for election purposes, reinstitutes the three-day media ban for advertising prior to elections. As we know, the Government's attempts to prevent free speech in election campaigns through the legislation which it passed through this Parliament with the support of the Democrats some time ago were overturned by the High Court, quite thankfully, and so the legislation was declared null and void. Now, through the back door, late in the debate on this legislation, the Government seeks to restrict in part our capacity to free speech and to advertise effectively in election campaigns by reinstituting the old three-day blackout period, which was part of this election broadcasting and advertising legislation some time ago but had been removed from that legislation and had not applied for quite some time. We are opposed to that backdoor method of seeking to restrict the capacity for free speech and I would urge the Senate in particular to reject that part of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, we support the general passage of these Bills, subject to the reservations I have mentioned, subject to the amendment which has been moved to the second reading and subject to further amendments that the Opposition will move in the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise not to speak on the technical aspects of this package of broadcasting Bills although there are some aspects which I would like to have dealt with at some length because there are some factors which I believe ought to be considered and I am not sure they have been considered fully. The time is late and I will restrict my remarks to the matters dealt with by Senator Walters. I will be supporting the amendment Senator Walters has foreshadowed. She has advanced good reasons for support of that amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also proposing an amendment and that amendment in fact is to allow this Parliament in the end to consider the questions of program standards. That is something that this Parliament has been denied by the Broadcasting Services Act. At this time, when there is widespread public concern over TV programs which for free to air television screen unacceptable themes and depictions of violence and sexploit material, I believe my amendment is quite appropriate and timely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), as has been indicated by Senator Walters, in his address to the Family Summit and since has expressed views that AO programs should not start until after 9.30 p.m. and that the M category should be split with only the milder versions being able to be shown on television. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has also expressed concern, as have the Australian Democrats, whose spokesperson recently pointed to the inadequacies of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, all this is whistling in the dark because, under the new Broadcasting Services Act, the Parliament has no say over codes of practice, the development of which are entrusted by the legislation to the commercial television networks. These networks have in effect thumbed their noses at the Prime Minister, declaring that they do not intend to extend the family viewing time&mdash;if that is what one can call the period up to 8.30. There are also moves, as a result of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's final recommendations, to screen after 10.30 p.m. material which, under current programming standards, cannot be screened at all. That matter has been referred to by Senator Walters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now return to the Prime Minister's statement. I differ slightly with one aspect of what Senator Walters has said in respect of what I understand to be the Prime Minister's view on the matter as outlined to the summit. I think it is probably more correct to say that the Prime Minister was concerned not only about dividing M into MV, that is M violence, and a lower category, but also, as he indicated in the summit:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the past there have been suggestions that a special category be created just for films which depict violence.</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate here that it was the recommendation of the ABT that there be an MV category. The Prime Minister has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While this would help to identify violent films, it would ignore the concerns of many parents in the community about coarse language, or depictions of sex or drug-use which also feature prominently in the "M" category.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that there should be two levels in the present "M" category.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first would cover the lower end of the category, would include all films and videos which contained "milder material" and would&mdash;like the present "M" category&mdash;be advisory only.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second, which might be called MA, would be restricted rather than advisory (meaning there would be penalties for allowing children under 15 access to these films unless accompanied by an adult) and would apply to the other, more raunchy and more violent end of the spectrum.</PARA>
<PARA>For completeness, I will continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time as we were making more sense of these classifications, we might want to take a look at the recommendation of the former Australian Broadcasting Tribunal for a single classification system for television and for films and videos.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present dual system is confusing to all concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to deal with the point that was mentioned by Senator Walters, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not trying to restrict what adults can watch.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But I do think I speak for many parents when I say we need more reliable means of knowing the contents of films and videos so we can make informed choices about what our children are subjected to.</PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to say that he proposes to ask his colleagues the State premiers and the Chief Ministers to agree to list film and video classification as an agenda item at the meeting to be held in Perth on 7 December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can see that there are internal contradictions in some of those statements. One can give the Prime Minister the benefit of the doubt when he says that only material that is contained in the milder version of M should be screened over television. He said that the MA category, which includes the violent and `sexploit' material, should be:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . . restricted rather than advisory (meaning there would be penalties for allowing children under 15 access to these films unless accompanied by an adult).</PARA>
<PARA>I presume he means that that material is not suitable for television. Time will tell whether that is what is being said. We should be very careful about anything the Deputy Chairman of the Film Censorship Board, Mr David Haines, might have to say on this matter, because of the views he holds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment I will be moving will ensure that the Parliament is able to act in the interests of the public and the electors. I will be indicating to the Committee at that stage that the amendment is couched in careful terms so as to essentially preserve the requirements for the development of codes of practice by the industry and for the development of certain standards by the ABA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that my amendment will not really interfere with the general thrust of the legislation. Indeed, the codes of practice will not automatically be considered by the Parliament. For any of those codes of practice to be overturned would require each House of the Parliament to arrive at a common decision, which clearly would not occur unless the matters were of grave public concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that what I am foreshadowing would also give to the Prime Minister an effective fall-back position if the television networks continue in word and in practice to ignore views expressed by him and other senior members of the Parliament about this issue. That is what has happened. Since the Prime Minister's address to the family summit, there has been no abatement at all in the showing of violent and `sexploit' material at 8.30 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, on Sunday last week, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Death Wish</EMPHASIS> started at 8.30 p.m. I have a letter from a retired, very senior broadcaster indicating that that film was violent, with at least a dozen gun and knife killings and full effects of gore and splashing blood. On Monday last week at 8.30 p.m., <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hot Spot</EMPHASIS> was shown on Channel 9. As this broadcaster describes it, apart from the usual gun violence and no-holds-barred bedroom sex, there was explicit cunnilingus and fellatio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Friday last week at 8.30 p.m., <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In Bed With Madonna</EMPHASIS> was screened. This was described by the film reviewer of the guide in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, Doug Anderson, as a cavalcade of masturbation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bachelor Party</EMPHASIS> was screened at 8.30 p.m. on Saturday last. All these films have been screened since the Prime Minister made this declaration. The same reviewer in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> described <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bachelor Party</EMPHASIS> as a farce of exceptional crudity and destructive stupidity which teeters on the brink of pornography. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the television channels are thumbing their noses at the Prime Minister. They could not care less about what he says. They are trying to patch him up. They are trying to say, `Yes, we will show all the details of what is contained in this material so that parents can make a judgment', ignoring the fact that there are many single parent families and that the pressures of household and work for many mothers and fathers are such in this day and age that it is virtually impossible to control at all times what children see on television. The daddy of them all was when FACTS said that the problem with having AO films commence at 9.30 p.m. is that the adults will have to go to bed at 11 o'clock or 11.30 p.m. Would you believe it!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not seen in the objectives of the Broadcasting Services Act a requirement that priority be given by broadcasters in their programming to the time when adults go to bed. But I do see in the broadcasting services legislation an amendment which was carried by this Parliament requiring that the television stations must give a high priority to the protection of children from material that is likely to harm them. That is what I see there. What some television stations are doing now is quite contrary to that provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I applaud what the Prime Minister has done; I applaud his statements and his concern. But I believe that we need to have something behind our back&mdash;some weapon&mdash;to use if some television stations continue to determine their programming standards in accordance with their view of how to make a fast buck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not proceed to make a further explanation of the amendment because I think I might be out of order. I shall leave that and hopefully will not need to canvass it in great detail in the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief. I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate. We have a number of serious concerns about technical deficiencies in Senator Walters's amendment. The amendment does not apply to ABC/SBS programming. It does not address the situation in Queensland during daylight saving where programs shown in New South Wales or Victoria at 9.30 p.m. will appear at 8.30 p.m. in Queensland or involve broadcasters in substantial&mdash;and I mean substantial&mdash;expense in purchasing time-shifting equipment at the cost of millions of dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AO definition relies on value judgments by broadcasters, especially with reference to paragraph (d) of Senator Walters's amendment. Only a classification scheme will offer broadcasters certainty for otherwise unclassified material. The amendment does not restrict M or R material being transmitted before 9.30 p.m., which leaves the peculiar situation of those more restricted categories being governed by standards which may be replaced by codes of practice, while the less pernicious AO is legislated for. I understand that the Democrats have their own concerns about the technical deficiencies in this amendment which they will canvass themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I am in the fortunate position of advising the Senate that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has succeeded in his negotiations with the television industry in producing a proposal which I hope every senator would support. It is certainly the most sensible proposition in terms of classification that I have seen for some time, and the Prime Minister is to be congratulated on getting this agreement, perhaps reluctantly. Perhaps it is too strong to say that it is an agreement, but it will bring the Government to a position where we will take the appropriate action to produce this result. </PARA>

<PARA>I indicate to the Senate that this proposal was only just thrashed out by the Prime Minister this evening. It would be inappropriate to try to draft the legislation, if legislation is necessary, in that time, and I do not think any senator would want us to do it. I will certainly give the Senate a commitment that whatever action the Government needs to take in relation to this proposal will be taken before the end of this parliamentary year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just indicate why I believe this proposal that has been thrashed out by the Prime Minister is not only welcome but also very rational and reasonable. The M classification has for years been a source of irritation to many people and is often commented on. There is no need for me to go to great length tonight as to why it is unsatisfactory, but I will give an indication of how unsatisfactory this broad classification is. Films that are currently rated as M include <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Batman</EMPHASIS>; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Crocodile Dundee</EMPHASIS>; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Steel Magnolias</EMPHASIS>&mdash;a wonderful movie; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rain Man</EMPHASIS>; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Don's Party</EMPHASIS>; and Chevy Chase's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Funny Farm</EMPHASIS>. But the M classification also contains movies such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kick Boxer</EMPHASIS>, a very violent movie;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Full Metal Jacket</EMPHASIS>, also a very violent movie; and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Silence of the Lambs</EMPHASIS>, an extremely violent movie, but in my view a superb movie which I am certainly glad I watched and would be happy to watch again, being an Anthony Hopkins fan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will understand from that short list that I have read out that review of that M classification is long overdue. I think it would receive general support across the industry and in the community if the classification were to be split into far more appropriate classifications and provide a reasonable opportunity for those movies to be viewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry has also indicated that it intends to publish far more detailed information about what is going to air than it currently does. There is no question at all, and I think most people would agree, that the crude classification of AO is far too crude and broad, and encompasses far too wide a range of material. Simply being shifted a full hour from 8.30 to 9.30 cannot be done without severe financial implications for the networks. I do not want what I say to be misunderstood. I am not suggesting that the networks need to be pandered to. Clearly this proposal does not do that, but it has to be laid on the table that a full hour shift in the current AO classification, which is as broad as I have just indicated, cannot be done without severe financial repercussions on the networks, which are not in a very robust financial situation currently. They cannot move their feature movie back a full hour without making virtually redundant some other programs, from which they get advertising revenue, because most people generally leave television&mdash;even the late nighters&mdash;at about 11.30 p.m. and go to bed to get ready for the next day&mdash;</PARA>

I simply conclude by saying that the Government will be, for reasons which I do not want to go into, opposing the second reading amendment that Senator Alston has moved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say a couple of things about this amendment. It really does not give us much to go on. Frankly, I am very suspicious of the situation where it indicates that M and MA material will be able to be broadcast over television. If MA material is going to be allowed to be screened over television then that will mean that there will be material which includes the worst depictions of sex, violence and coarse language than is currently able to be screened over television now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what I said before in commending the Prime Minister. I think that there are smarties around the place who have got into this and who are dollying this up behind the scenes. It has been put forward as being a proposition worthy of support. Some of this clearly is worthy of support. But unless the Senate is assured that what this proposal means is that material that is currently not able to be screened on television under current standards will still not be able to be screened on television under current standards, then it ought to be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern about this matter is that the OFLC is the body that is to become involved. The Deputy Chairperson of the OFLC, David Haines, was on the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal inquiry into the classification of program material on television. It was he and his colleagues who recommended, on page 23 of the report of the inquiry into the classification of program material on television:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We propose that, for the purposes of television broadcasts of M classified material under self-regulation, broadcasters adopt a system which splits the M classification into two categories, with milder material in the lower M range being equated to the current AO classification and thus able to be shown from 8.30 p.m., and material in the M classification, which includes stronger depictions of sex, violence or coarse language, being restricted to broadcasting in an unmodified form only after 10.30 p.m. This arrangement would be an interim one until such time as changes were made to the OFLC standards.</PARA>

That is not what the Broadcasting Tribunal and what Mr David Haines are saying. It might be what the Prime Minister wants, and I support him in it. The ABT and Mr Haines were recommending that we have an MB classification. The Prime Minister said to the family summit, `That is not sufficient because there are unacceptable depictions of sex, drugs and so forth which parents are concerned about'. So he put that back on the agenda, and I compliment him on it. He says that that sort of material ought to be in an MA category. At the National Family Summit he said that the MA category will be a compulsory category and that it will be an offence for adults to show this material to persons under the age of 15 years. I assume that what he means is that the MA material will not go into television. I assume that is what he means because that is precisely what he said to the family summit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to be clear as to where we are going. There is something missing in this amendment which I had hoped to see. There is probably a good reason to have PG. It is a good thing to have PG rather than PGR. That is a forward move, but there are certain things in PG which we need to look at. One positive aspect of the report and recommendation of the ABT was that there should be a strict family viewing time. I cannot see this in the recommendation here, but it is in the ABT recommendation. That was a positive recommendation. I hope that the Prime Minister will take up the recommendations relating to a family viewing time where parents can be quite confident that there will be nothing in that family viewing time which could be considered harmful to children viewing on their own. That is a matter which could be taken up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment has just hit the deck, and I do not want to say anything more about it until I have studied it a bit further. I point to the inconsistency of the Prime Minister in saying to the family summit that MA material would be a compulsory category and that it would be an offence&mdash;or words to that effect&mdash;for adults to allow children under 15 years to see that material. I assume he meant that that sort of MA material will not go over television. </PARA>

If the Government is going to reclassify all programs, then that is going to take a long time. If the Government is not going to classify all programs, then just dividing M into the two different categories allows the commercial stations to get the violent pictures that they are presently not allowed to show on television, but which is their desire to show. </PARA>

He said AO, the most violent material that can be shown on television today, should be put back to 9.30 p.m. If we agree to what the Minister is suggesting we will allow more violent material to be shown at 9 o'clock, not at 9.30 p.m. as the Prime Minister said for AO. </PARA>

The dynamic of that process was finding&mdash;and I am pleased to say a number of senators who have criticised this see these as positive elements&mdash;a rational system of classification but at the same time preserving the commercial base of the operations. We do not want to see any of those TV services collapse because, frankly, I do not think the majority of Australians, as concerned as we all are about the question of violence and classifications, want any lesser choice in our television viewing than we have at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very easy for senators to sit in here and pass laws that have profound commercial implications for the broadcasters. Fortunately, the Prime Minister is a little more responsible than that and wants to see a change in the regime. He wants a clearer classification system and some modification consistent with the evidence that is available in terms of what is put to air, but at the same time he does not want to cause television networks to go broke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only person who has raised that question during this debate in here has been me. It is very easy for senators to come in here and say, `Let's put all AO on at 10.30 at night'. I point out that we cannot make those kinds of radical shifts in programming on television networks without profound negative commercial implications for the networks concerned. The end result of that will be less choice for Australians in what they view because the networks will not be able to sustain all of the commercial operations. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tonight Live with Steve Vizard</EMPHASIS> is a classic example of late night viewing. It will be an unsaleable program because programs like that will have to be put to air so late that the viewing audience will be so small that one will not be able to sell the level of advertising for those programs that one can now. The majority of the audience will be in bed if the main feature movie cannot start until 10.30 at night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are matters for negotiation and reasonable outcomes. With respect, I think that is what we have here. But the detail does have to be provided. I thank honourable senators for the support that they have given for this proposal. Having spent six hours with Senator Walters in Estimates committees debating why the ABC broadcast the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Riddle of the Dead Sea Scrolls</EMPHASIS> on Palm Sunday, we are not likely to produce a result on this matter that will satisfy Senator Walters, but it may satisfy the more reasonable people in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Senator Harradine again, because it is an important point and I give the assurance for a second time, that these classifications are an arrangement that will provide a staggered time for viewing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the hopeful consequences of the end of the Cold War and the winding back of the vertical proliferation of the nuclear arms race was the possibility that at last there would be an end to nuclear testing, and the nuclear weapons states would sign a comprehensive test ban treaty. The world was encouraged by a French nuclear test ban moratorium in the Pacific this year, as well as a Russian moratorium, but until recently, the United States, the United Kingdom and China would not follow this initiative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now it appears that the US Congress has at last forced the hand of the outgoing United States President, George Bush, and from last month the United States began a nine-month moratorium on testing. This is good news. This moratorium will be followed by limited safety testing for three years and a total ban is to be imposed in 1996. With the arrival of a new President in the White House, it is possible that this timetable may be speeded up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am afraid that my notes would not be decipherable in the form of a speech that could be incorporated. The Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, has been under pressure from his military to resume nuclear testing, especially when it seemed that President Bush would veto any resolution from Congress to call a halt to nuclear testing. However, Congress has managed to get around the President's threatened veto and so Mr Yeltsin also has been able to resist his military pressure and extend the Russian moratorium. Now we await news from London and Beijing to see whether they too will join the moratorium and commit themselves to a total nuclear test ban treaty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are, therefore, nearing a very significant and vital point in the history of nuclear disarmament. It is worth recalling the long haul of the peace movement to achieve a comprehensive nuclear test ban. Initially, in 1963, the peace movement had a failure in the sense that a partial test ban treaty was signed after the military managed to block a comprehensive ban on nuclear weapons testing. Although France and China ignored the partial test ban treaty and continued atmospheric testings after 1963, there were some successful results with the other three nuclear weapons states switching to underground testing. An unfortunate consequence was that the demand for nuclear disarmament eased somewhat as the dangers of radioactive fallout receded from the public mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following worldwide protests in the early 1970s, spearheaded by peace organisations such as Greenpeace and Campaign Atom in the South Pacific, as well as the support of the Labor governments here in Australia and New Zealand, the French moved their tests underground after 1974 and China opted to go underground as well. As the second wave of the peace movement got under way after December 1979, the demand for a comprehensive test ban treaty came back onto the international agenda. It was the Labor Government that was elected here in 1983 that made it a major plank of its foreign policy, and the six-nation initiative gave further momentum to this demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, this demand encountered a hostile and intransigent administration in Washington, first under Ronald Reagan and then under his successor, George Bush. When it became almost counterproductive to raise the issue with the Reagan Administration, the Australian Government switched its energy to a chemical weapons ban, although it continued to lobby for a comprehensive test ban treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask: why was there such opposition to a comprehensive test ban treaty, and why has the world had to wait for 30 years for one to come? Initially, the push for nuclear testing arose from a desire to test, develop and refine new weapons after the first test in New Mexico in July 1945. Each nuclear weapons state built up highly specialised teams to design new generations of nuclear weapons, and we are now up to the fourth generation. There are a number of books in the Parliamentary Library documenting these developments and covering all five of the nuclear weapons states. That number becomes six if we include India, which tested one nuclear weapon in 1974. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the opposition to this comprehensive test ban came from the United States, where the role of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California has been decisive in persuading each successive administration in Washington to oppose the idea. There have been a number of articles on how this was achieved, not least those published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin of the Atomic Scientist</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not surprisingly, one of the key figures in this total opposition is the man who provided the model for Dr Strangelove, Dr Edward Teller, also known as the father of the hydrogen bomb and the man who sold Star Wars to Ronald Reagan. This intransigence, pushed along by the military and the weapons makers themselves, has been caused by what Sir Solly Zuckerman referred to as the technological imperative. Incidentally, Sir Solly Zuckerman was the British Government's chief scientific adviser for 25 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The technological imperative fuels the arms race, he argued, because it has to go on justifying its own existence. Teams research and design new weapons, and then have to invent new and better ones in order to keep ahead of the enemy, who is also being pushed along by the same forces in the military-industrial-scientific vicious circle. That is why we are now up to the fourth generation of nuclear weapons being designed for the weapons of star wars, the strategic defence initiative, now known as `brilliant pebbles' or by its latest acronym, G-PALS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a weapons team is dissolved it could take up to 20 years to build up again, so it has to be kept busy doing something. Sir Solly Zuckerman, later Lord Zuckerman, argued it was this momentum, the technological imperative, which was the main driving force behind the nuclear arms race. This is precisely why it is so important at this point in history to have a comprehensive nuclear test ban. We may have lost enemies, but we have not lost this drive to keep up the arms race based on the technological imperative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the survival of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, it is very important that we continue pressure for its renewal in 1995. The original agreement was based on the commitment of the nuclear weapons states to achieve a comprehensive test ban and to move towards disarmament. The end is in sight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year things looked rather gloomy. The French had drilled another hole at Mururoa to start testing again in May 1993. In May this year the Chinese tested one of their largest nuclear weapons&mdash;one well over the threshold agreed on by the United Nations and the Soviet Union in 1974&mdash;at Lop Nor. President Yeltsin was under pressure from his generals to start testing, although a people's movement had finally put an end to tests at the Semipalatinsk site, leaving only the site off the north coast of Siberia on Navaya Zemalya. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The British Government's position was that it tested only once a year anyway and that it intended to continue in order to maintain `the effectiveness and safety of our deterrent', although there was no suggestion of who it was trying to deter in these days. Finally, I feel I must put on record the continued and courageous opposition of the Western Shoshone nation in Nevada, which has been active over many years in trying to put a stop to nuclear testing on its ancestral lands in the south-west of the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These activists must be congratulated for the moratorium that has been achieved. Many other activists have supported them in their struggle, including a number from Australia, amongst whom was my predecessor, Senator Vallentine. Greenpeace, Campaign Atom, PND and people's movements and governments throughout have all contributed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, hopefully, the end is in sight, although we must continue to try to stop any further tests by any nation until a comprehensive test ban is signed. Disarmament is a step by step process, but if we can put a stop to that technological imperative at this level now, it will rank as a major achievement in the movement towards nuclear disarmament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Procedures for repatriating illegal Indonesian fishermen vary slightly between States as a result of differences in the numbers apprehended, and different State and Territory prosecution policies. In general, such fishermen are repatriated to the nearest port in Indonesia as soon as possible after fisheries authorities have completed their investigation of contraventions of fisheries legislation, and any sentences that may have been imposed following conviction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia, both masters and crew are normally prosecuted and if convicted, serve custodial sentences at Broome. When available to travel, fishermen are transferred by scheduled bus to Port Hedland and placed aboard a commercial flight to Denpasar. Both bus and aircraft may be chartered if the numbers are sufficient to make this more economical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland, generally only the masters of vessels (and not crew members) are prosecuted for contraventions of fisheries legislation, and may serve custodial sentences. On release from gaol in the Cairns/Townsville region, the masters are placed on commercial flights to Kupang or Denpasar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Crew members are transferred by ferry and bus from Thursday Island to the nearest airport at Horn Island, and are then repatriated by charter flights to Merauke in Irian Jaya. These repatriations are usually accompanied by an officer of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (DILGEA), and one Queensland Police officer per aircraft. Spare seats are sometimes offered to other government organisations based on Thursday Island that have a role in dealing with illegal fishing issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Northern Territory, masters of vessels only are prosecuted, and are generally fined and not imprisoned. The master and crew remain in Darwin until legal proceedings have been finalised. The fishermen are then placed on a commercial flight, usually to Kupang.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all States/Territories, where the court orders vessels to be confiscated, fisheries authorities arrange for the vessels to be destroyed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) &amp; (3) The tables below indicate, for the past three financial years, the number and cost to DILGEA of repatriations of illegal Indonesian fishermen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) There is no standard procedure or ratio for DILGEA staff accompanying fishermen being repatriated. As indicated in response to question 1, repatriations in Western Australia and the Northern Territory are not accompanied by DILGEA staff. In Queensland, an escort of one Police officer per aircraft, and one DILGEA officer accompany each trip. With commercial flights, and the larger charter aircraft as used in Western Australia, the carrier determines whether or not security arrangements are necessary. In view of the light aircraft used in the Torres Strait, which carry no cabin crew, DILGEA considers it necessary to provide escorts for repatriations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) A group of 18 illegal Indonesian fishermen was repatriated to Merauke, Indonesia, on 19 July l992, accompanied by seven officials and three private pilots. The officials were:</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">one Quarantine official</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">one Customs official.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two aircraft were used for the repatriation. The largest aircraft available for charter at the time had 19 seats. As it was considered unacceptable to have only one police escort for 18 people, a second 9-seater aircraft was chartered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of chartering the aircraft for the round trip was approximately $3000 for the 19-seater and $1500 for the 9-seater. As these costs remained the same regardless of the number of people travelling, the Customs, Quarantine and Queensland Fisheries officials were invited, in the interest of fostering a closer relationship between various enforcement agencies working together in the Torres Strait, and to acquaint them with Indonesian officials and their procedures. Three seats remained vacant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is understood that the Customs and Quarantine officers were not to be paid salary or overtime. It is not known whether the Queensland Fisheries officer was to be paid. While the Department has not yet finalised payments for this exercise, the estimated cost to DILGEA of this repatriation would be $4500. Any variation would be minimal. The cost would not have been affected by the additional officials travelling.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has advised the following. The response prepared by Mr Miller was based upon information received from a variety of sources. Mr Miller was unaware of the situation with regard to the export of wild caught koalas as he did not have available to him at the time a copy of The Conditions For The Overseas Transfer Of Koalas, nor was that information contained in the material that was available to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The requirements for the export of live native Australian animals including koalas are defined in sections 12, 13, 21, 25, 26, 27 and 31 of the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982. Essentially these mean that the export of live koalas is restricted to inter zoological gardens transfers under permit where the recipient institution is adequately equipped to provide suitable care for the animals. Provided the exporting zoo does not require the koala for the purposes of breeding, exhibition or research, a captive bred or wild caught koala can be exported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Conditions For The Overseas Transfer Of Koalas were revised in 1984, 1986, 1988 and 1990 in consultation with zoo experts and representatives of the State and Territory wildlife conservation authorities experienced in the husbandry and management of koalas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent revision was initiated on the basis of a decision of the former Council of Nature Conservation Ministers in September 1990 that the current Conditions For The Overseas Transfer Of Koalas should be amended to allow for reimportation of koalas following short term loans. State and Territory wildlife conservation authorities and major Australian zoos were again consulted and the revised conditions address the concerns that were raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Condition 23 was included to take into account concerns which may be raised by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service about any koala proposed to be exported and subsequently imported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Condition 23 states: "Where koalas are to be loaned to an overseas zoo and reimported into Australia, prior approval must be obtained from the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and the enclosure in which they are to be held must be, in addition to the conditions stipulated in condition 19: (i) fully rodent proofed; and (ii) fully insect proofed."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The arrangements for progeny of loaned koalas are covered under Regulation 7 to the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982, where the overseas zoo is required to give an undertaking that it will not trade commercially in Australian native fauna. Therefore, this requirement applies to the native fauna exported and any subsequent progeny. There is no intention to change this position.</PARA>

Similarly, under the Save the Bush and One Billion Trees Programs there have been numerous projects funded which have provided direct benefits for fauna (Refer to Question 6). It is important to note here that these revegetation programs also have major indirect benefits for fauna in general.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) first became aware that a tape of the program may be in existence when it noticed in its media clips of 10 October 1992, a copy of an article concerning the dispute which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Williamstown Advertiser</EMPHASIS> on 30 September 1992. The report stated that Mr Greig had supplied the newspaper with a recording of the show during the previous week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABA contacted Mr Grieg that day to confirm whether a tape was available.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) It is of concern that a dispute between members of 3WRB has been raised in Parliament. Under the licensee's internal Rules of Association the Committee of Management of 3WRB can by resolution decide to expel a member on certain grounds such as not complying with those rules of Association. Those rules also allow for the member's right of appeal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue rightly belongs with the members of 3WRB and its management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The former Australian Broadcasting Tribunal concluded its inquiry into the 3WRB licence in April this year. The Tribunal had been asked by a member of the public to consider whether the licence should be suspended or whether licence conditions should be imposed. The decision was to impose a condition requiring the licensee to hold a general meeting to discuss changes to its rules. This has been done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABA has continued to be informed of the activities of 3WRB by individual members. At this stage the ABA does not consider it necessary to commence an investigation into this matter.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) All properties, with the exception of the sale of the property at 213 Merrill Avenue, Rockhampton, were valued independently prior to sale. A real estate agent's market appraisal was obtained prior to the sale of 213 Merrill Avenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale of Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) houses in Queensland is part of a national program of disposals. The CAA has also taken the opportunity to link a concession on sale of houses to staff with removal of conditions of service rights as a means of achieving substantial reduction in the cost of employing staff at remote locations.  Sales to staff are normally made at valuation less any applicable concession. The sliding scale of concessions ranges from $12,000 for staff giving up all term transfer rights to $2,000 in recognition of savings in cost of sale and relocation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the variations reported on the table, the majority of the CAA houses sold in Queensland during the 1991-92 financial year were sold to staff most of whom were able to avail themselves of the concessional benefit. This explains the large number of instances where the sale price was below the valuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Initially staff of the Authority were offered the opportunity to purchase surplus houses.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategy adopted for the disposal on the open market was to seek the services of a major real estate franchise group covering all the sale locations.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Staff of the Australian Geological Survey Organisation (AGSO) previously the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics (BMR) seeks the consent of local landowners before undertaking field survey work on privately owned land as a matter of course. Consent is usually given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990-91 staff sought permission to undertake field survey work for the North Queensland National Geoscience Mapping Accord Project on a range of privately owned land in various tenures. Of the Aboriginal communities listed Old Mapoon agreed to access, Aurukun refused access, Lockhart River agreed to access in April 1990 but later withdrew agreement and Cowal Creek did not respond to correspondence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) AGSO mapping programs are based largely on noninvasive remote sensing methods such as satellite imagery and air borne photographic and low level geophysical surveys. Ground traverses are necessary to validate interpretations of the remotely sensed data, such as recording details of rock type and structure. Ground access is also required for rock and stream sediment geochemical sampling and to take gravity measurements. In the past ground access has also been required to install radio beacons to provide navigation for the airborne surveys but this is no longer necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the relatively small areas concerned, lack of ground access to the specified areas will not have a major impact on the project although documentation of some aspects of the areas where access was not granted will not be at the same level of detail as areas where access was granted. This will affect analysis of surficial (regolith) and basement geology and assessment of resource potential of the areas excluded. Regional synthesis for the entire project area will be only marginally affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The National Geoscience Mapping Accord Projects are cooperative Commonwealth-State Projects. AGSO expenditure on the North Queensland Mapping Accord Project, which involves mapping a total area of 388 000 square kilometres, totalled approximately $3.2 million in 1990-91 and 1991-92. Contributions are also made to the Project by the Geological Survey of Queensland, the Australian National University, the United States Geological Survey and the National Resource Information Centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Projected expenditure by AGSO until the projects' completion in 1995/96 is expected to be of the order of $2.8 million. Information on other participants' financial contribution to the project is not available but expenditure by the Geological Survey of Queensland is expected to be comparable to that of AGSO.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question, based on information provided by the Federal Airports Corporation, is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The issue of charges for car rental operators at FAC airports has not been finally resolved. The consultation process is continuing. This process is aimed at accommodating to the greatest extent possible, the concerns of the Trade Practices Commission, the Corporation's charter, the best interests of the travelling public and the widely varying wishes of the different sectors of the car rental industry. A new discussion paper incorporating most of the suggestions and addressing most of the concerns has been distributed and is receiving greater acceptance. Some further ideas have been suggested, particularly as alternatives for the very small operators who are seeking access to airports. It is expected these ideas will also be incorporated in the agreements finally offered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Corporation does not have access to the information on each interested car rental operator to enable the Corporation to assess whether its changes will affect the viability of any operators. It is expected, however, that in an industry where price competition is rife, both on airports and off airports, the Corporation's move to charge all operators a fair and equitable fee for access to airports should improve the viability of those operators both large and small who are currently paying the appropriate fees and who are therefore disadvantaged against those who come onto airports and pay little or nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The proposals currently being discussed appear to give a small overall advantage to very small operators with less than 3% of the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Since more than 90% of all cars rented from airports are supplied by companies currently paying to the Corporation fees which are slightly greater than those proposed in the new contract, and since these charges have been in place for many years, </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it is assumed that the rental rates charged already include airport fees, so no increase in the rates charged is envisaged.</PARA>
