<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was just a touch of base sarcasm in it. The truth of the matter is that Senator Schacht holds himself up as a civil libertarian, as the Chairman of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, but he seems to have this quaint notion that human rights and civil liberties begin at the very shores of Australia and extend out. I find it remarkable that Senator Schacht finds no difficulty in denying Australians the intrinsic and inherent right to watch television advertising if they so choose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht made much of the fact that there has been, thus far, no great revolt on the streets as a result of the ban, and that was a measure of his approval. But it goes without saying that the identification card, about which we had an election, was not a major issue in that election. It was only after a subsequent awakening and awareness by the community of the implications of that card that we had the revolt that swept right across Australia. In due course the majority of Australians will take great exception to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht also has some quaint notion that all wisdom and knowledge resides in Canberra. He had no difficulty whatsoever with the fact that the legislation imposed itself upon State elections and local government elections. I find it absolutely outrageous that the Federal Government believes that in some way it ought to be responsible for controlling the manner and the method of political advertising not only for State elections but also for local government elections. I find it an arrogance, an impertinence, which is breathtaking in its width. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, in my view, it is not for the Government or for the Parliament to decide what is the most effective form of political advertising. It is inconsequential that, in the last election in California, which I think Senator Loosley referred to, 90c of every dollar was spent on television advertising&mdash;as if there were something inherently wrong with that.</PARA>

There is still relief to be had in the courts, however, in certain circumstances.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, `Wran's the Man' was the third one. I thank Senator Parer. Putting aside `Wran's the Man', because I think that was a misplaced slogan, the other two were effective. What they did was to articulate an emotional, subliminal feeling of the time. There was a feeling, perhaps latent, in the community at the time that it was time, and the slogan captured that feeling. The object of political advertising is not to create new information, but to articulate the feelings, even if latent, that people already have. To that extent, both those slogans were effective. `Turn on the Lights' was a very effective slogan. We had been through a period of darkness in Australia and that slogan very effectively picked up that feeling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that this legislation and these regulations are not about a government that is making, on behalf of the Australian people, a judgment as to where expenditure should be or expenditure should not be, what is the most effective way of advertising and what is not the most effective way of advertising. Quite frankly, it is none of its business to make those judgments. They are commercial judgments and political judgments, to be made by political parties&mdash;as are policies, as are platforms, as are issues and as are attitudes towards issues. The truth is that this legislation is brought before us because the Labor Party is going into the next Federal election without hope, without policies, without money and without any likelihood of any of those three elements changing in dimension. We now find that there is a ban on rights and freedoms of speech as a result of the crude politics this Government is seeking to play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps there was, in a not too obtuse way, no more practical example of this Government's fear of freedom of speech, and a comparison between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party, when recently we had Her Majesty the Queen in Parliament House. The Government allowed the Queen to come into King's Hall for two hours or an hour and a half to meet a number of Australian people, but denied her an opportunity to speak. In the normal course of events, if the Queen had spoken, John Hewson would have spoken. If John Hewson had spoken, he would have created an odious comparison between himself and the new Prime Minister, Paul Keating. Mr Keating had gone through that dubious pleasure on the occasion of the visit of George Bush and he was not going to have it repeated. So that Keating could not be compared with Hewson, the Queen was denied an opportunity to speak. </PARA>

As I say, Senator Schacht claims a great concern for human rights. Senator Loosley claims to be concerned for human rights. I rather wonder what the Lionel Murphys of this world would be thinking now if they could see what this Government is doing to people's human rights. However, notwithstanding the corruption of this Government, there is no prospect of its being re-elected. No doubt, in due course, this legislation will be repealed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;In exercising my right of reply, I rise to speak in support of my motion to disallow the Political Broadcasts (Tasmania) Regulations and Political Broadcasts (Australian Capital Territory) Regulations. To put the matter into perspective, I will just recount what it is all about. Honourable senators will remember that some 12 months ago this Government decided to introduce legislation which would have banned all paid political advertising on radio and television for 12 months of the year. It was the most draconian, outrageous legislation ever presented before this Parliament in respect of attacking freedom of speech and freedom of political expression.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the legislation progressed, the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) took a cocky view by saying that he was confident the legislation would be passed&mdash;legislation representing a total ban on political advertising for 365 days of the year, for ever. It became apparent that the reason for his confidence related to some shady backroom deal between himself and the then Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Powell. I can recall being jointly interviewed with Senator Kernot&mdash;who spoke on this matter yesterday&mdash;by one Haydn Sargent on radio in Brisbane. During that radio debate I remarked that it was apparent that some deal had been made. Senator Kernot, who at that time was throwing her hat in the ring for either leadership or deputy leadership of the Australian Democrats, said after a pause, `I sincerely hope not'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grassroots membership of the Democrats became concerned that the parliamentary members of their party, who had come in here supposedly to keep the so-and-sos honest, were making a deal on a principle for which there could be no compromise whatsoever. As a result, the Democrats changed leadership and remarked that under no circumstances would they support this attack on freedom of speech and freedom of political expression in Australia. Senator Coulter took over the leadership. As a result, because the Minister had lost the deal, the legislation was amended somewhat&mdash;not without a battle, I might say. It was only with the insistence of the Liberal and National parties that the legislation was forced before a select committee for investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, the Liberal Party, led by a task force committee comprising my colleagues Senator Olsen, Senator Kemp and me, engaged in a series of discussions around Australia. We called our own meetings and we found that every group in this country, with the exception of one or two&mdash;not surprisingly, one was the ACTU and I think the other one was Phillip Adams&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And maybe the ACF&mdash;were appalled by this legislation. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of all that, the Senate Select Committee sat and heard the evidence. Of some hundreds of submissions made, only one or two supported this Government. Yet, simply because of the weight of numbers, the Senate Select Committee came out supporting the legislation. My colleagues opposed this attack on freedom of speech and freedom of political expression&mdash;not based on any ideological reason but simply on the weight of evidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Towards the end of last year the Government decided to make this an urgent Bill, guillotined it through the House of Representatives, and put on a time limit in respect of debate in the Senate. I believe it was the longest debate that has gone on since 1964. But to show the incompetence of this Government, and this Minister in particular, even then it did not get it right. That debate had to be adjourned because the formulas in regard to the allocation of free time, as pointed out by Senator Macdonald, were found to be absolutely incorrect. We had to have separate discussions outside this chamber in order to come back with some sort of formula that was more equitable than the one that had been suggested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill was eventually passed with the support of the Democrats&mdash;except, I might say, Senator Sowada, who stuck to her principles. At the time I made the remark that when the Democrats were offered the choice between principles and money, they took the money. Not only did they collect a whole lot of additional free advertising paid for by the radio and television stations of this country, but also they made the absolutely lunatic proposal that at every election in the future a photograph, a CV and a brief description of policy for every candidate in the country be presented to every elector. That would cost millions of dollars, and logistically I would say it would not be possible. In the main, from the date of nomination close to an election will be about 20 days. In that period, every candidate in this country will present the Electoral Commission with a photograph, a CV, and a brief policy description, and the Electoral Commission will be required to put that in the hands of every householder in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are going to be some bizarre results out of all this. Imagine if you are the local cheap grocer. You can just pay your nomination fee and get your brochure distributed to every household in the electorate. That is the sort of stupidity that can come out of this. As I said, it is going to cost the taxpayers of Australia millions and millions of dollars yet again. These things do not come cheaply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill was eventually passed, with the support of the Democrats, and was sent over to Government House, where the Governor-General gave royal assent. At the same time, the Government tabled regulations in respect of the ACT and Tasmania, on which I moved the notice of the motion we are debating and finalising today to disallow those regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened then? They were found yet again to be wrong. The regulations were submitted, but they were gazetted on 2 January for application on 1 January. That is not legal under the Acts Interpretation Act. I might say that the Government had five working days to get it right. Yet again this Minister showed his incompetence&mdash;and that of his Government&mdash;by not even getting that right. Subsequently, as has been mentioned by the Minister, they recognised that they had made a mistake. They brought out another set of regulations, and there were errors in those as well. So they brought out a third set of regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quite legitimately sought the advice of the Clerk of the Senate on this matter. These things are opinions. All legal opinions are opinions. They are not definitive. One only gets the definitive answer when one goes to the courts. On the advice given to me, it was apparent that there were no regulations in force. They were all invalid or void. So I sought an opinion from the Clerk of the Senate, which I am perfectly entitled to do. He, doing his job, is required to provide an unbiased view.

We are not surprised by the actions of these characters on the other side. That is their modus operandi.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time Senator Kernot, trying to defend herself because of their agreement to go along with the abominable legislation, asked in debate if I would advise her whether I got the permission of the Clerk of the Senate to provide the legal advice that he had given me. Let me point out that Senator Kernot has been here long enough to know. If people on the other side question that right, they should look at the 1988-89 annual report of the Department of the Senate wherein it states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most advice to Senators relating to the Senate and Committee proceedings, whether given in the Senate Chamber while the Senate is sitting or elsewhere, is given orally, but in recent years there has been a tendency for Senators to request, and the Clerk to provide, written advice on matters of any complexity. . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Advice is given to Senators on a confidential basis, but it is always open to a Senator receiving advice to disclose it. In recent years there has been an increasing tendency, in accordance with the general greater openness of parliamentary processes, for Senators to disclose the advice they have received on particular matters. This has created an impression in some quarters that the Clerk and the Senate have undertaken some new or expanded advisory role. In fact, the advice which is now given covers the same areas relating to Senate and committee proceedings as advice which has always been given by Senate Clerks, and the only change is that more written advices are given and more of them are eventually disclosed. It is the view of the current Clerk that this openness&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which this Government does not want to know about, hence the ban on advertising&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which is determined by the Senators who receive the advice, should not be discouraged.</PARA>
<PARA>That is Senator Kernot's answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I provided a press release, and there was a lot of debate and thrashing around by the Minister, Senator Kernot, and a couple of others from the Labor side, which is not surprising, as to whether I should have used the word `if'. This is just scraping the bottom of the barrel. I attached the legal advice to the press statement so that people could read the legal advice and make up their own minds and determine whether the contents of my press release were correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the inadequacy of his own legislation and his own regulations was drawn to the Minister's attention, his only response to me&mdash;he is not known for having great intellectual abilities; in fact, that is the overstatement of the day&mdash;was that I had been emotional and, would you believe, dishonest. Can anyone believe that that person, of all the people sitting on the other side, would have the audacity to accuse someone else of being dishonest? Of everyone on that side, he is the last one to do that, and he knows what I am talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said to him, through the media, who contacted me,`I have put my advice on the table; if you disagree with it, put your legal advice on the table'. In the debate here yesterday he was asked the same question and his answer was no, he would not but he would show it to the Leader of the Opposition in private. What is wrong with openness and honesty in government? I was prepared to say, `Here you are, here's my legal advice. It is not just the advice I have received from the Clerk, it is also additional advice which I sought and received from experts in the field at the University of Queensland, and they supported that view'. As I mentioned earlier, legal advice is the opinion of one or more people and there can be differing points of view. That is why we have courts of law. The Minister refused to respond and provide his legal advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister why he has not yet tabled the other regulations? Does he have in mind some other nefarious little scheme&mdash;for which he is renowned? I do not know the answer to that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He probably does not realise an awful lot. The comment was also made, and I think I should respond to it, that everything has gone along fine since this legislation came in. Let me tell the Senate: it has not. For instance, and this was alluded to by some of my colleagues, the Liberal Party in Victoria was running a mid-term campaign on radio and television. Lo and behold, there was a by-election for a local government seat in Wagga in New South Wales. The regional radio stations in Victoria were told not to run the advertisements because they might affect the outcome of this by-election for a local government seat in Wagga&mdash;what made it more ludicrous in the end was that there was only one candidate&mdash;so the advertisements were taken off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also had the fascinating situation of two referenda running, one in Queensland and one in the Australian Capital Territory. In the Act, the definition of a referendum is one that seeks to change the Constitution. Neither of those referenda sought to change the Constitution. The one in the ACT was to determine whether the electoral system would be single member electorates or Hare-Clark and the one in Queensland was in respect of daylight saving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland, those supporting and those opposing daylight saving ran a fairly emotional campaign on both sides, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you will appreciate; and they were entitled to do so. They were entitled to run paid ads. However, people in the ACT were not. On verbal advice and on legal advice, the radio and television stations refused to run the ads. Irrespective of the outcome of the referendum in Queensland, those people who ran the ads opposing daylight saving would probably claim that it was only by alerting the city people to the problems in the bush that they were able to get the referendum result that they did. That is the sort of thing, in a general election campaign, that this Government has banned. It is preventing people&mdash;individuals in society, not necessarily people standing for Parliament&mdash;from actually getting their point of view across. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wrote to Mr Westerway of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, asking him on what basis the ads in the ACT were banned. After some days he responded to me. Basically, what he said was that the ABT was somewhat limited in what it could do. I can tell the Senate, because I have had feedback from the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, that it, being the policeman for this legislation, does not like it one little bit. Frankly, I do not blame it. The Tribunal said that, with the exception of children's programs, it cannot assess material for broadcast before it has gone to air and that it can respond to complaints from viewers or listeners only after a program has been broadcast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does that mean? It means that the radio and television stations have to take the risk; and, if they are wrong, they run the risk of having their licences taken from them. Mr Acting Deputy President, it is akin to you or me going to a police station, being unsure of the law, and saying to the local sergeant of police, `If I do a certain action, will you arrest me and put me in gaol or not?'; and he responds and says, `Go and do it and, your having done it, I will then tell you whether you are guilty or not'. It is absolutely ludicrous, and it is indicative of the great shemozzle this legislation is and of the fact that it should never have been introduced and should be thrown out. The new Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has indicated that it needs amendment. My observation would be that his consideration of amendments will not be based on principles, on which our whole stand on this matter has been based, it will be based on political pragmatism. If he thinks it is going to advantage the Labour Party, he will do it. If he does not, he will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the sort of thing that is wrong with this country. It is the sort of reason why Dr Hewson is so much accepted out in the community. He is prepared to put his cards on the table and not use simple, political pragmatism for the direction he takes. This is to be compared with the approach taken by the Prime Minister and to a large extent reflected by what came out in the statement last night. The statement, and I say this from a totally apolitical point of view, will not be any sort of incentive for investment decisions in this country, which is the only way to contribute to real growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should like to comment briefly on some of the remarks made by other participants in this debate. As I mentioned, the remarks made by the Minister, quite apart from his attack on the Clerk of the Senate, were so shallow as not to warrant response. I listened with care to what Senator Loosley said and I believe he maintained a very lucid argument in the main, which is more than can be said for the incompetent Minister who handled the Bill and the Act. The only comment I would make is that I thought Senator Loosley went very well until he started to compare the Australian system and what might be the case in Australia with the American system, particularly in respect to voting and the attendance at the polls. There is no comparison between the two. This is where I think he went off the track. He would have been more credible if he had drawn parallels not between Australia and the United States but between Australia and New Zealand, which is the closest country with a similar system. However, that will be the subject of another debate further down the line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, I have moved a motion to disallow these regulations. An argument has been put on the other side that this is just a repeat of what happened before Christmas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to present the Opposition's view on the National Rail Corporation Agreement Bill 1991. Reform of Australia's land transport infrastructure is a key national priority. It has been estimated that, if Australia can achieve world class performance in road and rail, gross domestic product would be increased by up to 2 per cent, with the bulk of 40 per cent of this potential gain coming from the rail system itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission, in its 1991 report on rail, estimated that moving to international best practice in management and work practices would increase gross domestic product by $5 billion per year, or $300 for every Australian. This Bill allows the Commonwealth to approve the shareholders' agreement relating to the establishment of the National Rail Corporation. The agreement is set out in schedule 1 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement was signed by the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia at the Special Premiers Conference in July 1991. South Australia has not yet signed the agreement and Queensland has not yet become an equity partner at this stage. Provisions have been made for these two States to participate in the future if they so desire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not oppose this Bill, but we will be moving an amendment, in an effort to eradicate a weakness in the accountability provisions of the Bill, during the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of background, the parties to the agreement agreed that a company would be established for the purpose of conducting interstate rail freight operations in Australia on a commercial basis in accordance with principles compatible with those set out in the Heads of Government agreement on the National Rail Freight Corporation of 31 October 1990. The principles are that the company will operate on a strictly commercial basis; have access to the requisite assets; operate under labour agreements that reflect best international practices in productivity standards&mdash;that should be borne in mind; be able to contract activities where appropriate; provide access to its network and facilities to public and private sector operators; be able to provide services to the governments on a strictly commercial basis; and not be in any way responsible for redundancies that may arise in rail authorities resulting from its formation and operation. A further principle is that, during the establishment period of five years, the current financial position of the Commonwealth and State rail authorities' interstate rail freight operations will not deteriorate as a result of the Commonwealth and the States participating in the formation and operation of the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides that the National Rail Corporation will be subject to all rates, taxes and charges; not have the shield of the Crown; and be treated as an ordinary incorporated company, including being subject to the Trade Practices Act 1974. The Bill provides for the transfer to the NRC of assets owned or leased by the Commonwealth or the Australian National Railways Commission. It also provides for substituting the NRC for the Commonwealth or AN in cases where the legislative transfer of assets or contracts has been agreed in accordance with the shareholders' agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for compensation where a transfer of assets under the proposed Act would result in the acquisition of property otherwise than on just terms, as defined in section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. The Bill also authorises the making of regulations, not inconsistent with the proposed Act, that are necessary for carrying out or giving effect to the agreement and to the proposed Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To turn to the financial impact, the Bill does not appropriate funds. However, the Commonwealth's cash equity contributions under the NRC agreement are forecast as totalling $295.8m in the five years, commencing with $40m in 1991-92, plus another $20m brought forward under the former Prime Minister's statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth's commitment is dependent on the NRC meeting the agreed principles already mentioned, particularly labour arrangements. The establishment of the NRC is expected to have an impact on the deficits of State railway systems and the Australian National system. This will be no small task, as the total losses on interstate rail freight are estimated to have amounted to $377m in 1989-90. The NRC is supposed to break even within three years and to be fully self-sufficient within five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia are founder shareholders. The number of ordinary shares is based on each shareholder's estimated long term equity in the company. Accordingly, the ultimate anticipated shareholding will apply at the outset instead of the usual basis of progressive cash and asset contributions. Additional shares will be issued if Queensland becomes a shareholder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shares initially allocated carry voting rights. During the establishment period, voting rights are fixed under the agreement. Afterwards, they will be in proportion to shareholdings, subject to a maximum shareholding of 49 per cent from any one party. The shareholders will contribute $414.5m, with the Commonwealth contributing $295.8m. The company will progressively take over functions from the Commonwealth and State systems, and this transference will be completed by the end of the company's third year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has some concerns about this legislation. As mentioned previously, we will not be opposing it but we will be suggesting an amendment at the committee stage. Industry has also indicated that it has some concerns. The matter I want to raise here, and it is one for which the coalition will move an amendment, is the weakness in accountability provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 5 December 1991, report No. 16 of the Auditor-General, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Accountability off the Rails</EMPHASIS>, was tabled in the Senate. The report raised serious concerns about the appointment of a private auditor to the NRC and the erosion of accountability to the Parliament. While supporting the establishment of the NRC to handle interstate rail freight, and later possibly passenger services, the Liberal and National parties are concerned that the Commonwealth has the majority of equity in the Corporation, and consequently the auditing should be carried out by the Auditor-General or under his control in order to fully protect taxpayers' money. We attach a deal of importance to this, particularly as the Commonwealth plans to invest $296m over five years. The intent of the amendment will be to ensure that the Auditor-General has the control of the audit of the Corporation while the Commonwealth is the major equity holder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very recent legislative precedent for our concern that the Auditor-General should control the audit. We made the same point in the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Act 1991 and were successful in having this provision written into the legislation. The Corporation must be open to public scrutiny. The Auditors-General of five States support the Auditor-General's Office's warning of the erosion in its ability to scrutinise the activities of a public sector company unless this amendment is made to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Scrutiny of Bills Committee notes that while the necessity to enact legislation must be considered an `unusual circumstance', there is still no obligation to proclaim this piece of legislation once the other parties to the agreement&mdash;New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia&mdash;have enacted legislation to approve the agreement. I would like the Minister representing the current Minister for Transport and Communications to give his views on this matter in his response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am the Minister for Transport.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, good, sometimes I think the Minister is acting. Another problem that the coalition and industry can see in the Bill is that unless governments cooperate with the Corporation to get the changes in place quickly, we believe it will be very difficult to get the costs down, as is anticipated by the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement specifies that labour arrangements incorporated in an enterprise award which reflect best practice in productivity standards must be in place before any capital is committed. This aspect of the agreement is of vital importance and one the coalition insists should be enforced. It is no use ruining the window of opportunity even before it has been opened by just throwing money at the railways&mdash;which lose millions of dollars each year currently&mdash;without addressing the fundamental underlying problem. If the problems the Government has experienced with redundancies in Australian National is any guide, it is clear it is not prepared to take the hard decisions necessary. This is not an encouraging sign for the beginnings of the NRC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not clear what the shareholding will be at the end of the five-year establishment period, but it appears no shareholder will be able to hold more than 49 per cent of the shares. This restriction places the claim of commerciality under a question mark. Also, in any commercial operation it would be known what the shareholdings would be right from the start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point the coalition would like to raise is what happens to the leftovers in Australian National and V/Line once the NRC is operational. It is our belief that if any lines are profitable&mdash;or capable of becoming profitable&mdash;the NRC should be encouraged to take them over on commercial grounds. However, this may not be possible because of the clause in the agreement which gives the States the power to decide what happens to intrastate lines. Of course, I can understand the concern in my own State because Queensland, with its own intrastate lines which carry bulk commodities, has used those lines for over a decade as the milch cow for government to the detriment of the mining companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will list some of the coalition's other concerns. Firstly, there are problems arising from the ability of the States to revoke references under section 51(xxxvii) of the Constitution. Under clause 3(1)(a)(i) of the agreement the States must enact legislation referring to the Commonwealth under section 51(xxxvii) of the Constitution the matter of the Commonwealth holding shares in the company when the company engages in intrastate rail transport services in each State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terms of the legislation when enacted by the States need to be considered as only an irrevocable reference which will apply to the long term will contribute to planning for viable long term commercial operations. However, under present case law it would appear that a referring State can at any time revoke the reference in the exercise of the sovereignty of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is resolution of disputes. Another area I want to comment on here is a matter which appears to be similar to one we were concerned about in the Roads Commission legislation. It involves a possible inappropriate delegation of legislative power. I am referring to clause (2) of the Bill which provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Act commences on a day to be fixed by Proclamation.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no limit as to the time in which such a proclamation must be made, and in this regard the provision is contrary to the general rule set out in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel drafting instruction No. 2 of 1989. The explanatory memorandum of the Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proclamation will occur when all the parties to the Agreement have enacted legislation approving the Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>This aspect of the agreement requires a more detailed examination for which there is no time now. However, it is quite possible there may be disputes at some future time for which there is no satisfactory process of arbitration as the Inter-State Commission no longer exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there is the adequacy of capital. Article 5(3) of the articles of association provides that during the establishment period no charges in the capital of the company, other than the 500 ordinary shares, 500 B convertible shares and such of the A convertible shares as may be allotted to the Commonwealth or any State in return for cash or in satisfaction of the transfer of interests in assets, may be allotted without the unanimous resolution of the company and general meeting. It must be noted that A convertible shares do not carry a voting right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment period is the period of five years commencing from 31 January 1992 or such later date as is agreed to by members in writing, being the common date from which all rail authorities of the Commonwealth and the States carry interstate rail freight on behalf of the company. That is in article 2(1). The transition period has been defined as the first three-year period of the establishment period in clause 1 of the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company runs the risk of being deprived of capital during the establishment period if the initial projections prove incorrect and if the members are unable to agree unanimously on the basis of allotting new shares to raise the required capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, there is the access to and transfer of assets to the company by the rail authorities. Clauses 5(5) and 5(6) of the agreement provide for the access to and transfer of assets to the company by the rail authorities. The objective is that all transfers of ownership, leases or grants of access shall be completed before the end of the transition period of three years. While clause 5(5) in particular is probably intended to meet the constitutional hurdle referred to previously, the practical implementation may lead to disputes in relation to contract prices for use of the assets, as they are tied with the efficiency of operations of the State rail authority that owns the assets and to NRC standard costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there are best practice industrial agreements. The agreement between the Commonwealth and the States revolves around the ability of the company to negotiate successfully with the unions concerned a best practice industrial agreement. Thus recital B(iii) expresses the hope that the company shall operate under labour arrangements incorporated in an enterprise award, which reflects best practice and productivity standards through efficient and commercial consideration. This is vital. What is meant by best industrial practice? What is the benchmark? Is the authority to adopt the negative, destructive work practices which have been the largest single factor which has contributed to the destruction of much of industry in Australia? Are we going to have a closed shop with union leaders who have no interest in their members, but only in their own power base, calling the shots? Are we going to have the same inflexibility which bedevils the rest of industry in Australia?</PARA>

Fix up the unreliability, fix up the work practices and we have got a great country, but I do not think we will do it while we have got some of these narrow-minded people who are more interested in their own power position that in their members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are we going to continue to have featherbedding, with three people doing the job of one? The aim of best industrial practice must be not simply to have an improvement on a corrupt system but to have the most efficient and productive industrial practices in the world. That has to be the base. That has to be the standard which we must achieve. It is no good, in the economic position we have in this country, just to improve our position. We must be the best in the world. Unless this occurs, then all the effort, all the capital expenditure, will have been to no avail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that it is incomprehensible&mdash;as I have always said, going back many years&mdash;that it is cheaper to move half a dozen or so cars by semitrailer from Melbourne to Brisbane than it is to move them as cargo by rail or ship. We support the introduction of a standard gauge rail so that we do not have to have the transfer costs of moving from one gauge rail to another. There is no doubt that that is a big step forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The infusion of additional capital is, under clause 5(1)(b) of the agreement, made dependent upon the confirmation by the company that best practices are in place to provide a basis for commercial operations. There would be considerable uncertainty of the viability of the company if best practices were not in place which were effective over a period longer than one year, to which awards under the current system generally apply. There may be room for disputes with unions on the contents of the ideal best practices agreement, leading to disagreements among members and consequential disruption to the injection of additional capital during the establishment period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sixth point is contracts for services and liquidated damages. Clause 5(3), which covers contracts for services between the company and the rail authorities of the Commonwealth and each State to be entered into before or during the transition period, lists matters to be dealt with in such contracts during the transition period. Certain inadequacies here raise the possibility that there is a lack of provision to resolve satisfactorily claims in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The seventh point is voting on approval of the corporate plan. Article 118(3)(g) provides for the directors to submit the corporate plan, within seven days of its preparation, to the members for approval. After consultation the members may, within 30 days of its receipt, approve the corporate plan by special resolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Article 118(3)(h) provides that, if during the establishment period the members have not approved the corporate plan as provided in article 118(3)(g), the plan may be approved by resolution involving two, three, four or five members. It will thus be seen that any two members opposing any aspect of the corporate plan, regardless of the number of shares held by them, may be in a position to frustrate the company by denying approval of the corporate plan. Another set of circumstances would make it possible for New South Wales, with 26.5 per cent of the votes, to prevent the passage of a special resolution, even if the Commonwealth were able to win the support of Victoria and Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, whilst supporting the general thrust of the Bill in its attempt to bring national railways towards a viable commercialisation, the coalition believes that there are a number of difficulties lying ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian,</EMPHASIS> on rail and road systems, noted that the rail system was riddled with inefficiencies. This is what must be addressed. The article said that not one of the State based systems was making profits from interstate freight, and that would be correct. In fact, just as an aside, I can recall many years ago trying to transfer freight&mdash;explosives being sent from Newcastle into the Bowen Basin by rail rather than by road. With all the best efforts in the world, even though the cost of road had escalated at a considerable rate, it was still not economically possible to do so. One of the reasons was that, once one got to the border of Queensland, the rail gauge changed. There is no doubt that a standard rail gauge is something we should all aspire to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prospects for interstate rail freight in its present form still appear somewhat grim. The coalition supports the Federal system, which distributes powers in a way which encourages participation and acts as a barrier against centralist, remote and authoritarian control. There is widespread agreement that Commonwealth-State relations are in urgent need of reform. There is also widespread agreement about the problem which needs to be resolved&mdash;duplication, lack of responsibility and apparent lack of cooperation between all levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation itself, we believe, is a move in the right direction. We, of course, find Australia in a very shameful state. We have intolerable unemployment, running at 10.3 per cent; successive quarters of negative growth; record rates of bankruptcies; youth unemployment which is totally intolerable; fourth and fifth generation farmers going off the land; and a 500 per cent increase in gross foreign debt, from $36 billion to $166 billion, over the past eight years&mdash;all this, of course, presided over by a government which in recent times has been torn apart by internal power struggles and self-doubt while the nation sinks lower and lower into an economic morass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own observation, having only briefly looked at the statement brought down by the Government last night, is that it will not contribute in any way to the revival, to the hope, to the attitudes of people in the next year or two.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the Senate today is the National Rail Corporation Agreement Bill, a Bill that is long overdue in its attempt to bring some commonsense back into the rail transport system in this country. I commend the move to rationalise our dilapidated rail system, thereby making it more efficient. I do regret, however, the general weakness in the proposed structure of the National Rail Corporation and I believe that these sorts of weaknesses should be corrected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inefficiencies in Australia's rail system are costing the country up to $4 billion a year, according to the Industry Commission. That means that micro-economic reforms of the railways has got to be one of the highest priorities for the continued growth of the Australian economy, particularly in regard to export potential. The various railways have to be made competitive. Only by being put on a competitive footing will railway be able to make its proper contribution to a more efficient economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complete inefficiency and ramshackle state of the railways has been well documented. One of the most disturbing examples is the case of a major Melbourne manufacturer who was finally persuaded to experiment with rail transport. He ended up being told by V-Line and the New South Wales SRA last year, when he tried this, that the entire train with his first shipment had been lost en route to Sydney. Four days later it was discovered marooned in a siding near Goulburn. Gross inefficiencies such as this cannot be allowed to continue and should simply not occur in a country that considers that it has an advanced economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission report in April this year was scathing in its criticism and demanding in its reforms. The railways have to be put on a proper commercial footing and the system must be opened up to competition. Getting the railways onto a proper commercial footing means making all freight cover its costs, instead of the present system whereby the mining industry is overcharged to subsidise other freight users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also means opening the tracks to anyone who wants to run trains on them. The obvious potential competitors are the various State rail authorities, the mining and transport giants, and now the National Rail Corporation. There is simply no proper reason why the State rail authorities should be protected monopolies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only are the authorities protected from the competition of other train operators but they are also protected to varying degrees from road transport. There are restrictions on road freight to protect the railway monopoly. These restrictions on competition must be swept away, and the mismanagement and union featherbedding that shelter comfortably behind them must also go. Australia cannot continue to throw away $4 billion of national income a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Rail Corporation, as established by this Bill, goes some way towards implementing the recommendations of the Industry Commission report and countless other reports that have urged similar measures over the last 40 years.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parties to the agreement, being the State and Federal governments, have decided to establish a corporation for the purpose of conducting interstate rail operations in Australia on a commercial basis. This sensible and long overdue move must be applauded by all Australians. This is not going to be easy, however, and now that the reform is finally on the way the momentum cannot be lost. Painful reform must continue, and at a more rapid and confident pace. The National Rail Corporation is not a crowning achievement of micro-economic reform but only the start of a hard and difficult slog towards competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is going to be extremely difficult to get costs down to the levels envisaged. It is, therefore, absolutely vital that the provisions in the Bill for ensuring that labour arrangements incorporated in an enterprise award reflect best practice in productivity standards are in place before any capital is committed. Once the capital starts flowing without the appropriate structure being in place, we have once again wasted the opportunity for reform. Getting the structure right is the major concern that I have with this Bill. Questions have to be raised as to the right of any State to revoke access to intrastate operations, the resolution of dispute processes, capital adequacy guarantees, asset valuation, and the power of any one State to disagree with the corporate plan for political purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NRC Agreement provides that the States must enact legislation to refer to the Commonwealth the power to engage in intrastate trade as a shareholder of the NRC. Under present case law, this referral can be withdrawn at any time. This possibility should be prevented by arranging for the NRC to conduct its intrastate operations on a joint venture basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another question that must be raised is the adequacy of the procedure for the resolution of disputes set down in the agreement, in view of the role laid down by the Constitution for the Inter-State Commission to judge certain questions in respect of railways. It is uncertain, in reading the present wording of the Act, whether this constitutional mechanism would override the provision for conciliation and arbitration as set out in the agreement. If the Constitution is the ultimate means of appeal, this would leave any dispute between the NRC and the State authorities unresolved until such time as the Inter-State Commission met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Problems could also arise due to a lack of capital in the `establishment period' set out in the agreement. Capital injection is set at a very low level during this period, until the States and the Commonwealth are able to agree unanimously on the basis of allotting new shares to raise the required capital. Should the initial projections prove incorrect, this could leave the NRC starved of the funds it needs to get off the ground. This issue must be looked at closely because of the danger of stifling reform before it is started. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ability of the NRC to negotiate successfully with the unions concerning best practice industrial agreements must also be questioned. This is an important issue because the entire funding of the project is tied to the success of these negotiations. Without these agreements, no further funding will be available. Without them, the NRC cannot proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see from this legislation and its obvious shortcomings that the NRC is not off to a smooth start. This is a step towards commercialisation of the Australian rail system and for this reason alone the legislation is necessary. Rail transport in Australia has great potential. Rail is ideal for most of the freight carried here. The problems to date have been the chronic inefficiencies that have plagued rail. The infrastructure has deteriorated, lines have been decommissioned, restrictive work practices have created enormous inefficiencies, and costs are artificial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has led to a situation where rail has lost more and more of the freight market, when instead it should be dominating the market. It is high time that the rail operators realised that they are not in the rail business; they are in the transport business. Rail can be efficient, cheap and profitable all at the same time. The commercial sector can see the convenience and the capability of the rail system, and laments its inefficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the National Rail Corporation can fulfil its promises, it will be a step in the right direction towards increased competitiveness. It will create a more competitive economy, one with the right infrastructure in place to allow us better to weather the next downturn in the business cycle. Thus I support any moves towards this end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the legislation before us poses some potential problems, as I have outlined. I must therefore express some reservations about this Bill and whether it provides the best possible vehicle for the National Rail Corporation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of this Bill is to establish a National Rail Corporation, along the lines that were mooted by various States quite some time ago. To my knowledge, the Commonwealth Government and the governments of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia agreed to set this up according to the principles agreed on 30 October 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main reasons is to operate the rail connecting Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth on a commercial basis, which certainly has not been happening in the last few years. To do all this, it has got to have complete access to the track, to achieve the run-through in micro-economic reforms that is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, the major problems causing rail to be unable to compete with road have been&mdash;on top of the rail track itself being run down a certain amount&mdash;the different awards for operators of the trains and people that work on the trains between, say, Perth and Sydney, and the different rail authorities with their different running stock and locomotives, rather than rolling stock that goes right through. There are three safe working systems, I believe, between Sydney and Perth; there are three State rail authorities operating them. You just do not have a certain amount of efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome this move because, in the long run, our side of politics will be privatising the whole system. I believe, however, that the track should remain the property of the Federal Government, in case of war and other reasons why it would be needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labour agreements that reflect the best international productivity have got to be put into action too. It is pointless having more than one award right across. That is what has led to the problems at the present moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The upkeep of the track between these States has been a problem. It has been let run down. One of the reasons it has been let run down is that the amount of money that is available does not go far enough because of the way it is kept up. We on this side of politics will be looking to privatisation of the contracts to maintain the line, where contractors can work 24 hours a day if necessary rather than for the limited times when the major capital equipment that is needed for rail upkeep can be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose we could look at the airport model: FAC owns the airports at each end and licenses the airline operators to work in the airspace in between. It would be the same with a rail track: private contractors could be allowed to put their own rolling stock on the track, to be hauled by ANR locomotives, National Rail Corporation locomotives, or indeed, in time, private locomotives. It has to be a fully commercial operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been impossible in the last 20-odd years for rail to compete with road. Because road is mainly private enterprise, the trucks can move quickly&mdash;too quickly in some cases&mdash;and when they get to the other end they go straight into their terminals and trailers can be disconnected. At present wagons arriving in Perth from Sydney may get shunted in late on a Friday night and no-one can get to them until Monday morning&mdash;two days wasted. With a private enterprise system they could go into private freight yards or yards leased off ANR and they could be accessed immediately. It is useless a train getting to Perth from Sydney faster than a truck&mdash;and they should get there faster if truck drivers keep to their strict speed limits and regulations&mdash;to have those wagons tied up for a couple of days in a yard that cannot be accessed. This Bill provides the means of getting somewhere down that track, but I am afraid it does not go far enough. Part of the Bill provides access to the rail network and its facilities for public and private sector operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, notwithstanding this Bill, the new Corporation should not be responsible for redundancies that may arise from the transformation of the rail system. We do not want to put those people out in the paddock without anything else, but that responsibility lies, I believe, in the area of social security. Rather than making the rail system an inefficient transport system that cannot compete with others because of that factor, I am sure that social security can look after those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the first five years, the current financial position of Commonwealth rail and State rail will not deteriorate as a result of this new company. That is what we have been told by this legislation. It is going to be subject to all rates, taxes and charges, of course, which any other company has, and will not have the shield of the Crown. Assets that are leased by the Commonwealth or ANR are to be transferred to the National Rail Corporation, and the total commitment in the Bill is $295m over five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, I have my doubts, and others have their doubts, whether this is quite enough to get this transport system up to the standard that we require in this day and age. As I said before, if it is going to work it will depend on agreed principles, especially with the labour arrangements. If we remain with the present labour arrangements, I am afraid it is not going to get very far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, in 1989-90 the losses on interstate rail amounted to $377m. I presume that this system will wipe that off as soon as possible. The break-even time is supposed to be three years&mdash;although I reckon that that timetable is a bit short&mdash;with the Corporation to be fully self-sufficient in five years. It is going to be very difficult to do that in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This idea has been around for quite a while. It is 12 months since we were supposed to see this Bill, which was set up first of all to start on 1 July 1991. It was postponed then and it was supposed to start on 31 January 1992. That has come and gone, and I do not quite know when it will be actually getting going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, this is the time this Corporation has to work. If we fail to get rail back onto its feet this time, I am afraid that the rail system of Australia will go down the tubes and road transport will take a further share of it. In the last few years in this place there have been attempts to get rail back to where it should be in Australia. However, those attempts have been brought about by loading taxes, regulations, and other measures onto road transport and that is not the way to do it. When one loads it onto road transport, rather than making rail efficient, one is loading it onto short haul road transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my knowledge, I would say that about 70 per cent of road transport is in distances of about 60 or 70 kilometres. So when one tries to load taxes onto the long haul transporters, using the kind of measures that this Government has used in the past few years&mdash;I have always said in this place that I do not believe that any road transport from Perth to Sydney or Melbourne to Brisbane should be able to compete against rail, and yet it does, and very easily&mdash;one is also damaging the road haulage system in the short haul. One of the prime examples of that was when B-doubles were allowed in Victoria. In order to put a load on them, and to get money back to spend on rail, they were loaded with registration fees of about $12,000 a year compared with a standard semitrailer system of about $4,000 a year. Unfortunately, this does not work and the people of Victoria are obviously paying for it in the cost of their freight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this company is put together I understand that a valuation of the assets has to be done. I certainly hope that for Westrail, in Western Australia, the valuations will be true and correct. Westrail is the most efficient rail system in Australia. It is shown that Westrail's part of interstate rail is the only line that is making a profit. So we would like to be assured that it will be evaluated on a true basis. I do not really understand why this Government insists that in this case no one shareholder will get more than 49 per cent of the company. If that limit is imposed, I cannot see how we will have true competition in the long run, especially when we are talking about it all being internally owned. If we are talking about overseas ownership, that is a different story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to know what is to be done with the leftovers in this system. Once you have the main interstate lines all running on the one basis, what will be left over? V/Line and AN as well? What will happen to those other lines? Will they eventually be brought into this system or will they just wither away and the lines close down? I know that a lot of lines in Australia have been closed in the last 20 years. I have been a supporter of some and a critic of others, especially of the grain lines in the more remote areas. A lot of those lines are now part time lines. We would like to be assured that where lines are needed, they will be kept; so we would like to know what will happen to the leftovers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we want to be assured that the State of Western Australia&mdash;and indeed, any other State&mdash;will always have the right to withdraw if things are not going well, if we are being imposed upon and if we are not getting our due rights. As I said, Westrail has been making a profit of $2m a year. There are disputes and resolutions that have to be looked at. There is also the guaranteed capital, which I have mentioned before, and assets valuation, which I have covered. All in all, I believe that this Corporation will begin what should have been put into action quite a few years ago. When the coalition is in government, it will be an easy step for us to go as far down the road of full privatisation as possible. </PARA>

But before turning to the investment funding and rail construction plans that this new National Rail Corporation will oversee, I will look at the establishment of the Corporation itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the Democrats support the establishment of the Corporation because it should be able to implement significant improvements in the rail transport system. It is based on the Commonwealth-State agreement, one which we welcome. It is an acknowledgment, not only by the Federal Government but by those various State governments, of the importance of a national rail system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth-State agreement and the Articles of Association allow for full privatisation of the Corporation after the five-year establishment period. It is very well known that the Australian Democrats strongly oppose the privatisation of such a vital public asset, for the obvious reason that provision of community services becomes much more difficult to achieve once government control is lost. A fully privatised corporation would be under absolutely no obligation to provide community services, even when those services might be fully paid for at commercial rates by the Commonwealth. The decision as to whether those services would be provided would always be in the hands of the fully privatised corporation, should that come to pass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, in spite of our opposition to privatisation of the national rail system&mdash;which, as I say, is provided for by this Bill after the five-year establishment period&mdash;we feel compelled, on balance, to support the legislation on the basis that it is an important step in the right direction; a step, as I say, which acknowledges the need for a fully national, coordinated, hopefully efficient and effective rail system in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the second reading speech of the Minister, when the Bill was introduced last year, we see this claim:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even small improvements in the efficiency of our transport system offer potentially large economic and social gains.</PARA>
<PARA>The word that jumps out at me, from that sentence, is the word `small'. It jumps out because of the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) last night, which I would like to comment on. It has been touted as a major boost for rail transport. An additional $454m will be provided to the Corporation to standardise and improve the national rail system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At first glance this level of rail spending really looks like a most welcome boost to a vital element of our national infrastructure. It is a boost, and it is welcome, but I would quote the Minister's second reading speech: on balance it is a small improvement. I suppose the Prime Minister and the Government are hoping that the claim made in the second reading speech will be true, and that small improvements will have large economic and social gains&mdash;at least in time for the next election. But, as I say, any improvement is a welcome improvement. But it must be remembered that under Labor investment has been appallingly low. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his statement of last night, the Prime Minister points out that the construction of a national rail highway `should have been done 100 years ago'. That means that it could have been done over the last nine years under Labor governments in which Mr Keating was the major policy architect. The fact is that not even $454m over the next two years will compensate for the total neglect thus far of rail by this Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no evidence provided by the Government to demonstrate that the money it proposes to spend will result in a major shift of freight from road to rail. We are told in last night's statement that Melbourne to Sydney rail transit times will be 12 hours, a reduction of 1 1/2 hours. But a modern, heavy truck can do the trip in 10 hours and go direct to its final destination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be fascinated to know whether any cost-benefit studies have been done predicting, as a result of the package announced, such things as the shift of freight and passengers from road to rail, the reduction in road deaths and the reduction in greenhouse gases due to greater fuel efficiency. If such studies have not been done the Government is simply throwing public money at rail in the absence of a cohesive transport strategy. If there are studies, the public and certainly the Parliament deserve to see them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats recognise that the national rail highway that is represented by last night's statement is a step in the right direction, provided that the NRC succeeds in reducing operating costs and improving reliability. But we are convinced that more money could have been spent for far greater benefit. Why, for example, did the Government fail to take the plunge to upgrade the Melbourne-Sydney line to a fast freight train standard, reducing the transit time to, say, nine hours and providing a truly competitive transport service&mdash;surely necessary if we really do want to shift freight from road to rail?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be remembered that more than $730m has been spent by Labor on upgrading the Hume Highway, Melbourne to Sydney. This puts the $110m to be spent on the Melbourne-Sydney rail line into its proper perspective. The fact is that roads were the real winners in last night's statement. The hype that surrounded the rail plans has tended to disguise the fact that road spending will be increased by a greater amount, around $600m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put on the record here too, Mr Deputy President, that I have some particular concerns about the rail transport plans emerging for Victoria. For example, the statement includes the blunt admission by the Prime Minister that the future of spur lines off the Adelaide-Melbourne line is `a matter for the Victorian Government'. Mr Keating, of all people, knows very well the parlous state of Victoria's finances and this means that he has signed the death warrant of existing broad gauge lines to rural Victoria and has washed his hands of any responsibility for the consequences&mdash;a callous and unacceptable way, in my view, to treat rural Victorians who are now dependent on a functioning rail line. The Federal Government must consult the Victorian Government to identify the likely closures and their social and economic consequences and decide what action should be taken to avoid or to cushion the blow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned that the upgrading of the Melbourne to Geelong line, which of course is welcome, has been driven rather too much by the desire to shore up some two or three marginal Federal seats and five or so marginal State seats that will be serviced on that particular line. It seems to me, however, irrational to upgrade that part of the line, Melbourne-Geelong, when one can travel at the other end, at the East Gippsland end of the Melbourne-Gippsland corridor, and see electrification poles being ripped out of the ground. This is an area where 80 per cent of Victorians live and it should be seen as a corridor, not just as a vote catching Melbourne to Geelong exercise. This illustrates the point I am making about the emphasis in the package last night on the national rail highway at the expense of those routes that are not part of that major trunk system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context, the plan to build a road from the South Dynon rail terminal to the Swanson and Appleton docks, virtually mid-city in Melbourne, really mystifies me at this stage. It is a move that will add more trucks to an extremely heavily congested area right on the edge of the central business district in a city suffering from chronic and worsening smog problems. That problem is seen as a major one by citizens of that city, just as Sydney people are concerned about theirs; and it seems to me that the logical thing to have done there was to have upgraded the rail link. Surely this would have been a greater contribution to efficiency and, in the case of much of the freight movement, would have removed one change of mode from the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to summarise the transport initiatives in last night's statement: they appear to have been too hastily cobbled together in the absence of a clear transport policy framework and without a thorough cost-benefit assessment. If the Government begs to differ from that, it will need to put evidence on the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat, however, that the Bill before us today is supported by the Democrats on the basis that it represents a step in the right direction and an acknowledgment of the need for a national rail system, a need recognised by both the Federal and State governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that calls have been made, in relation to this legislation, for the Corporation to accept the Auditor-General as its auditor during the five-year establishment period. I am also aware that the Opposition intends to move an amendment to this effect. I find the Opposition's attitude bewildering, if not hypocritical. If the Corporation is to be allowed to operate on a fully commercial basis&mdash;something which I understood to be very firm Opposition policy, as it is Government policy&mdash;and indeed down the track to become a fully privatised body, again a matter which is Opposition policy and the potential for which has been put in place by the Government but is opposed by the Democrats, then surely to be proposing that the Corporation be forced to use the Auditor-General as its auditor flies in the face of that free enterprise, privatised approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I received a letter from Mr Greiner's Transport Minister, Bruce Baird, urging that the Corporation be free to choose its own auditor and supporting very strongly the Bill in its present form. I wonder whether Senator Parer got that letter. The real issue at stake is that the Corporation should remain accountable to the Parliament for as long as the Commonwealth is a shareholder; and I hope that the Commonwealth will be a shareholder in perpetuity. To this end, I will be moving an amendment to require that the Corporation's annual report to its shareholders be tabled in both Houses of Parliament. My amendment will acknowledge the Corporation as an independent body and will allow the Corporation to choose its own auditor, but will require, as appropriately should be the case, that the Corporation's report be tabled here in the Houses of Parliament, the Commonwealth being a shareholder on behalf of the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Opposition has gone overboard on this one, and so too, of course, does Bruce Baird, the appropriate Minister in New South Wales.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Rail Corporation Agreement Bill 1991 is really a machinery Bill, in the sense that it sets up machinery whereby a National Rail Corporation can be established. It is set up pursuant to an agreement between the Commonwealth and several States&mdash;New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia. It has that distinguishing mark of being an agreement between States, one of which is presently ruled by the coalition. So it is an across-party agreement, as it were. That is to be very much welcomed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 1 contains a memorandum of association and articles of association which set up this company, and schedule 2 sets out the functions that this Corporation will perform once set up. I suppose the significant thing about the legislation is not so much the mechanisms that it sets up to enable rail to return to the place it ought to, but the fact that it is a ringing endorsement of rail transport. It is good to see that this legislation, which is a symbol of the nation's faith in land travel, and specifically in rail travel, has been endorsed by the statement last night of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) which says that hundreds of millions of dollars will be devoted to backing up what we today are symbolising by passing this legislation. It is clear, as Senator Powell has said so well, that rail is here to stay, and so it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rail is a very efficient means of transport; and it provides an alternative to road transport, which has its problems. It is to be noted in this context that the statement last night also indicated that hundreds of millions of dollars devoted would be devoted to roads. So after the plan has been worked out, we will then have very efficient rail and road systems in Australia. That is proper, given the fact that Australia consists of major cities and towns which are quite divorced from each other when compared with other countries. Vast distances must be traversed, and traversed as efficiently as possible. If there is anything that vindicates this Government's stand on micro-economic reform, it is what it is doing now in respect of land transport. This Bill heralds a most imaginative scheme, a great undertaking, and last night's address by the Prime Minister ensures the great vision will be realised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few things to be noted about rail transport. Though it may run on power produced from a fossil fuel such as coal, ultimately it utilises that energy much more efficiently than does road transport. Because the burning of that fossil fuel can be located in particular areas, it is better for the environment. These matters are of considerable importance, and it is proper that they be pointed out. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As things now stand, it is true that rail freight services operate at a deficit, but studies have shown that rail enjoys significant competitive advantages over road transport for medium to long distance haulages, in terms of fuel and energy efficiency. I have already spoken about that. It is important because transport costs are at the heart of the total price that our nation's export oriented products, such as steel, coal and wheat, incur. It is imperative that the movement of these goods between producers and purchasers occur in the most cost-efficient manner. This Bill is the first stage in the plan to achieve those essential economies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go now to the position of railways in Victoria, particularly in the west of Victoria. I go to Wannon as part of my duties; it is a great part of Victoria and of Australia. The Victorian Government&mdash;to give it proper credit&mdash;has invested more than $100m in recent years in making substantial improvements to performance of rail in that area. As a result, VicRail's capacity to move wheat efficiently and with flexibility from the great producing areas of Victoria to the ports of Portland and Geelong will be retained. Although Senator Panizza is familiar with wheat growing in Western Australia, I suppose he is not quite so familiar but nevertheless considerably familiar with the great wheat producing areas of Victoria, which no doubt he admires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the rail system in the west of Victoria be retained. If it is not retained, the wheat would have to be transported by other means such as the B-double trucks. These cause considerable problems in terms of damage to the roads, particularly in the country areas, and to the smooth flow of traffic. If rail were to disappear from that part of Victoria, and all transport was to be done by B-doubles, Victoria would be under all sorts of strain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems with the spine line that will go down the east coast of Australia, around the corner, and over to Adelaide is that it will be of a different gauge from the lines that run in the west of Victoria. It is imperative that this great scheme that the Federal Government has initiated does not result in the lines in Victoria being rendered non-viable. It is imperative that money be spent to make sure that they are kept open so that wheat, and cargo of all sorts, can be transported by rail. Passenger lines also must be maintained in that State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless adjustments are made when this new line is put around Australia, there is a threat not only to the cargo carrying capacity of trains in Victoria but also to some of the V/Line passenger services there. For example, in Victoria we have passenger services to Ballarat, Ballan, Melton and Bacchus Marsh. These are heavily patronised, popular and offer relatively high cost recoveries. There is a need to enhance these services through the introduction of better vehicles, more frequent trains and improvement to passenger amenities. It is clear that the National Rail Corporation brings risks as well as opportunities and we must ensure that the opportunities are grasped while the risks are avoided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is proper that the needed change in Victoria be looked at promptly. For example, there is a need to look to the issue of whether there ought to be special provision made for lines between Sydney and Melbourne so that the time for the journey can be reduced from 13 hours, as it is now, to 10 hours. It can be reduced with some improvements to infrastructure and at a relatively low cost. If this is done there is a chance that there will be re-engendered in Australia a culture of travelling by rail. To some extent, this has not been the situation in recent years but it was there in the old days. It provides a very safe alternative to travel by road and by plane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Mr Dick Smith, who is the immediate past President of the CAA, said that we have to get more traffic off the roads. He proposed that it go into the air, but with improvement to the rails there is another alternative open. That would mean that Australia is provided with good air services, good road services and good rail services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also proposals to bring Sprinter trains into Victoria, and if the planning is properly done that will ensure a good long term performance by both freight and passenger rail services. </PARA>

I have spoken about the need for Victoria, on the basis of that State being central to the prosperity of the nation as a whole, to have good rail services. It is a matter not only for Victoria but for the nation as a whole to see that the lines presently running in Victoria are run efficiently. There are proposals to re-route lines, for example, between Melbourne and Ballarat. When that is being considered, it should be considered not only in terms of what is best from the point of view of economics, although that is a very important issue, but in terms of what is best for the customer because, after all, it is the customer that must be properly served. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on the National Rail Corporation Agreement Bill 1991, I begin by making some general observations with regard to transport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, it is important that the transport infrastructure in Australia is structured in such a way, and is so competitive, that whatever mode is used will be the most efficient and most economical way of carrying out the particular task. I do not think we should get carried away with promoting one against the other, as tends to happen from time to time in debates such as this. It is very important, as far as this Bill and the agreement that has been reached between the Commonwealth and the States are concerned, that in the medium and longer term the structure is such as to maximise the efficiency advantages of rail in the carriage of some goods, in those tasks that rail can carry out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the proposed corporation should be seen as one that will necessarily lead to the replacement of road transport or of air transport. They all have a role to play. Under the regime we have had in Australian transport or in interstate transport, there have been disadvantages to different modes of transport, which have worked against the States within Australia using the most efficient means of carrying out a particular task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer particularly to a couple of points as far as this Bill is concerned. Some of it must go back to the statement of last night, although I shall not dwell on it: the rail systems are still paying fuel excise. Fuel excise was put in place, as I am sure we are all well aware, initially for the task of building and maintaining roads. The rail system currently is, in effect, charged about 7c per litre of fuel that is used&mdash;to enhance a competitor. That in itself creates an anomaly and puts rail at a significant disadvantage as a transporter, particularly of bulk commodities. That is something that needs seriously addressing. I have raised it in this place and prior to coming here, on a number of occasions. It was not until we saw the light of day of the Fightback package that we actually saw this particular problem, which is a very unfair imposition on the rail system, being addressed. I bring it again to the attention of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some years ago we found, in work that we did in Western Australia, that about 20 per cent of the direct cost of carting grain in Western Australia on rail arose as a direct result of the fuel excise. It put up significantly the cost to the individual producers whose wheat was carried on rail. It put the rail system at a significant disadvantage to road transport and it meant that a task that should have been carried out on rail was forced onto the road systems through bad economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next concern I have about this Bill is the emphasis, when we have a States and Commonwealth agreement, on interstate carriage. Senator Cooney alluded to this. In terms of maximising the efficiency from this agreement, I ask whether enough consideration has been given to the impact that it could have within the States, particularly in my State of Western Australia. In a number of the tasks that are being carried out, and because of the different gauges of the railway line, it could put the State systems at a disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hope that in the not too distant future we will see a statement from the Premiers of the various States, and the Commonwealth, as to how they will allow the various State systems to maximise an agreement such as this, as far as the cartage of goods within a State is concerned. Of course, the vast majority of the tasks carried out by rail, particularly in agriculture and mining, are carried out within the States. Having said that, I must add that I believe that this will also give the opportunity for goods and services, particularly bulk carriage of goods, to move between States much more efficiently and more effectively than has happened in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another very great concern that I have in terms of this agreement. When we get down to the principles, we look at (iii) and (v). Paragraph (v) says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">provide access on a commercial basis to the NRC network and to terminal facilities for private and public sector operators;</PARA>
<PARA>I endorse that particular principle, but then when we go back to (iii), which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">operate under labour arrangements incorporated in an enterprise award,. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I want to ask how we can have one enterprise award to cover the total operations for both the private and public sectors, in terms of this particular agreement. I do not believe that it can be effectively or efficiently done. In particular, when we get private operators coming onto the particular line or operation, we will find that they will be coming in to carry out a particular task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be different requirements in terms of the manning levels, the hours, the stoppages and what is required to carry them out. For example, a quite different agreement would be required for the shifting of minerals across this country, from that required for, say, motor cars that were brought into the port of Fremantle, and put on the train to Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide or any of the capital cities. I believe it is quite ludicrous for us to see `operate under labour arrangements incorporated in an enterprise award' in the principles of the agreement. It really spells out clearly the problem that the Government has with its current industrial system when it operates on the basis of a fundamental principle that big is beautiful when, in fact, situations are quite different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia some years ago we saw the introduction of two-man crews for carriage of grain in our State. It was one of the decisions that kept a significant amount of grain on our rail system. In addition to that, obviously it kept the trains rolling. In fact, in terms of the grain task that was being carried out, it increased the number of people employed in the rail system by actually taking one person off a particular train, because more trains were running and carrying out that particular task. The situation in Victoria, South Australia, Queensland or New South Wales, could be quite different for different tasks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I am sure Senator Panizza would have mentioned, you have different crewing levels to carry out a task in the mining industry from those you have in the grain industry. You also have a different arrangement in terms of the cartage of wool on the rail system. Talking about wool, much of that has moved to road transport in recent years because it is a more efficient way of moving it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in terms of this agreement, I do question the wisdom of having as one of the principles that we operate under a single labour arrangement incorporated in an enterprise award. I think it is sheer nonsense. There must be flexibility in terms of the various tasks that have to be carried out. Hopefully, under this new agreement we will see an increase in passenger movement across Australia, but to try to have an enterprise award for the tasks that have to be carried out on a passenger train, as against a goods train or a bulk train, is really quite ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that I would like to raise here concerns the amendments relating to accountability. Senator Parer covered these, so I will not say a lot on them. But in terms of the accountability of such corporations as the National Rail Corporation it is essential that the Auditor-General be the auditor for the Corporation. I think that the reports on the accountability and the credibility of these particular operations and their overseeing should come through the Auditor-General and should be reported back to this Parliament on a consistent annual basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks by saying, first, that it is important&mdash;and I re-emphasise this point&mdash;that transport policy must be designed so that the most efficient and most cost-effective of the modes of transport which can carry out the tasks wins each particular task. There should not be a loading in favour of rail, road or air transport. Secondly, it is essential that the impost of the fuel excise on rail transport in this country be removed so that it is not put at a disadvantage in relation to its competitors, particularly the road transport industry. Thirdly, in terms of the principles that are incorporated in this agreement, having a principle whereby one operates under labour arrangements incorporated in one enterprise award really amounts to staying in the Dark Ages and not moving into the nineties and the two thousands. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The position of the Australian Democrats on issues is becoming increasingly unpredictable. They seem to wish to have the luxury of looking at each issue on a case by case basis, which gives no consistency in terms of their position on many fundamental issues. The issues that give me most concern are those of accountability to this Parliament. It was the Australian Democrats who endorsed the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts. That recommendation was that the Australian National Audit Office was to be the auditor of government instrumentalities, including government corporations. At the time this did not fit easily with some Labor Party people. Increasingly we are seeing attempts by this Labor Government to usurp the fundamental role of the Auditor-General. It is increasing, and it is very disappointing to find the Australian Democrats&mdash;the people who want to keep everybody honest&mdash;falling into this attitude of relaxing the essential role that the Australian National Audit Office has to play in terms of its responsibilities to this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of the Auditor-General is essential to the accountability of this Parliament. The Auditor-General can perhaps be perceived as an extension of the arm of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts, with which it works most closely, and also of the Parliament itself. Indeed, the Auditor-General meets on a regular basis with members of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to state quite clearly, because there is some confusion, that the position of the Liberal-National coalition is in no way to be seen as a reflection on the private sector auditors or on the high professional manner in which they execute their responsibilities and the high ethical standards to which they adhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue is merely one of what is the appropriate authority to be the linkage between this Parliament and the statutory authorities in circumstances where the Commonwealth has a significant and a major financial interest. While members of this Senate are rightly concerned about community service obligations and the wider social responsibilities of statutory corporations, it is distressing to see legislation of this nature demeaning the role of the Auditor-General and replacing him as the essential link between these so-called increasingly independent statutory corporations and the Parliament. Increasingly, we are seeing such corporations&mdash;though not all of them&mdash;thumbing their noses at issues of social responsibility, community service obligations and accountability at times when it suits them. This is a serious contradiction, since all of these statutory corporations have a bureaucratic arm supposedly directed to meeting social responsibility criteria and accountability-type responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give an instance. Telecom has decided to centralise certain activities in Tasmania, with the result that a significant number of people will be moved from the north-west and the north of the State to Hobart. Unfortunately, Telecom did not see fit to communicate to the staff or to the wider community the cost-benefit behind this decision. It was an autocratic decision which appeared to lack logic to the unions and appeared to lack logic to the communities in which these staff members were located. I think this is typical of what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we must see is a strengthening of the relationship between this Parliament and the statutory corporations, and that appropriate linkage is the Australian National Audit Office through the Auditor-General. We all know that the Auditor-General should be the final arbiter, but he does have the power to contract out audit responsibilities to the private sector and increasingly he is doing so. This is quite significant and quite appropriate. In fact, as issues are becoming more and more technical in certain areas, I think it is entirely appropriate that he should not only be relying increasingly on the private sector to provide audit services, in terms of getting teams of people in to audit particular activities of government instrumentalities, but also reaching out to seek advice on a technical nature from the private sector. Therefore, it is indeed an unfortunate time to see yet again a reversal in principle by these Australian Democrats sitting on the cross-benches who have such a significant impact on accountability issues, on moral issues, and on issues which affect the future of Australia. </PARA>

In the House of Representatives two days ago, on an important tax Bill, the Government did not have an adviser to answer Opposition queries&mdash;on a technical tax Bill, No. 4. This is just another reflection on the fact that this Government wants to make this Parliament a rubber stamp. We must avoid that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Last week the commander of the UN Advance Mission in Cambodia, General Loridon, criticised the Khmer Rouge for obstructing UN personnel; on Tuesday the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Gordon Bilney, attacked the Khmer Rouge for jeopardising the Cambodian peace settlement; and today we learned that the commander of the Australian contingent in Cambodia has been shot whilst flying over an area known to be under Khmer Rouge control. When will the Minister come clean about the danger posed by the Khmer Rouge to the increasingly fragile peace settlement and to our forces in Cambodia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The area of Cambodia over which this unhappy incident occurred&mdash;an injury to Colonel Russell Stuart, who is the commander of the Australian contingent to the UN Advance Mission in Cambodia&mdash;is an area where the Khmer Rouge have been active. But it is by no means an area confined to the Khmer Rouge. In fact, it has been described as a patchwork quilt, involving occupancy on the ground by the three resistance factions. The only faction that is not in the immediate area that was the subject of the attack is in fact the SOC army of the present Phnom Penh administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is simply not to be assumed that the shots were fired by a member of the Khmer Rouge. Investigations are proceeding. It may never be known where the shot came from; it may never be known whether it was the result of some kind of order and some kind of semi-disciplined military exchange or whether rather it was the actions of a bored or disgruntled individual soldier. All of these things are possible. So the very premise of Senator Hill's question does not stand up to very close scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, of course, the case that there are and will continue to be throughout the UN's occupancy of this transitional role in Cambodia, risks to the soldiers on the ground. We do not need rather unhappy grandstanding of the kind that we are listening to today from Senator Hill to be aware of those risks. We do not need to be reminded of them. We have stated them&mdash;Senator Ray, as Defence Minister, has done so; Mr Bilney has done so; I have done so&mdash;on innumerable occasions. There are risks from disease; there are risks from mines. There are risks of being exposed to some degree of sporadic fire or cross-fire in the context of the kind of military engagement that has happened on this occasion, particularly in the period before the disengagement of the various factions&mdash;their cantoning into barracks of one kind or another&mdash;and the putting aside of their arms is accomplished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very delicate and difficult stage of the peace operation, particularly in the absence still of the full-scale UNTAC group which is so crucial to the success of the operation. The risks will continue throughout this period. Our troops there are professional soldiers. They know of, are aware of and accept those risks&mdash;just as we have to be if we and other countries are going to make a contribution to the resolution of this very unhappy, drawn out, continuing tragedy in Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the settlement process is very much on track. It has taken time to assemble the resources, both financial and otherwise, that are involved in the full scale UNTAC operation. My understanding is that tomorrow the UNTAC operation will be formally endorsed and approved by the UN system, and it is to be hoped that the deployments of the necessary personnel, both military and civilian, will now very rapidly proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not help this process, which is going to be a protracted, difficult and rather fragile one, for it to be exposed to the kind of cynical shafts that we continue to get from Senator Hill. He and the Opposition have been no help whatsoever at any stage of the laborious attempts to put together a peace plan in Cambodia. He has hoped for nothing more than that some political advantage, as he saw it, could be gained by the process falling apart. It has not been an edifying sight to witness the role that he and the Opposition have played in this, and he has done nothing to improve his reputation by that question here today.</PARA>

If he was concerned, he would have put down a statement in the first instance. The Minister says the settlement processes are on track, so why is it that the new Secretary-General of the UN is now going back to the factions, arguing that they should agree to a 100 per cent demobilisation rather than the 70 per cent agreed at the Paris Peace Accords of which Senator Evans was a principal part?</PARA></TALK.START>

Of course it would be preferable. Blind Freddy could see that 100 per cent demobilisation would be preferable. The biggest lunatic in the country could see that 100 per cent demobilisation would be preferable. It is obvious that it would be preferable. But the point is, it is unachievable, and the point is that the Secretary-General has recognised that the best that could be negotiated is a 70 per cent demobilisation. That is the language which remains in the settlement text; that is the language that remains in the plan that he and the United Nations have endorsed; and that is another cheap shot, another total misconstruction of the situation, demonstrating a combination of both incompetence and immorality in Senator Hill's approach to this particular issue.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macdonald interjects and says that we should read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document. Indeed I have. Obviously Senator Macdonald has not. I do want to say something briefly about the one paragraph that passes for an aviation policy in the 600-page <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document. The Government is proposing very substantial changes to Australia's aviation policy that will take aviation, with confidence and with security for potential investors, into the twenty-first century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first stage of this process involves the immediate implementation of the removal of aviation specific restrictions on equity investments between Australian operators. That is, it breaks the barrier between international and domestic operations in Australia. The first stage is to proceed immediately to renegotiate our bilateral agreements that require renegotiation for multi-designation and to facilitate charter operations by Australian based operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second stage, with implementation as soon as possible but no later than 1993, involves trans-Tasman services by inviting the New Zealand Government to agree to multiple designation on trans-Tasman routes with operations by any Australian or New Zealand carrier and Qantas domestic carriage. Implementation of a policy of multiple designation for Australian carriers is part of this stage of the proposal, along with allowing additional freight carriers to operate on international routes to and from Australia, and multiple designation for Australasian carriers in international markets at the end of the day, if we successfully negotiate a common aviation market with New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This stage will centre on moves toward this common market and these changes will be of particular benefit to the vitally important tourism industry in this country&mdash;currently, as I said yesterday, the largest export earner that this country has, contributing fully 10 per cent of our total export earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian aviation industry already has an annual turnover in excess of $7 billion and directly employs 50,000 people with, of course, significantly more in indirect employment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not true; it is fundamentally untrue. The opposite is in fact the case. The Federal Airports Corporation was proceeding with the planning for the third runway, as Senator MacGibbon says quite correctly, prior to the decision being taken by the Government.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The depreciation allowances that were announced in the statement last night can benefit Australian industry and investment in a number of ways. The prime purpose of those changes to the depreciation system was to make the system of business tax in so far as it relates to investment much more competitive than it was with the international regime and in comparison with a number of other countries&mdash;countries with which we are sometimes traditionally compared, such as those in the OECD, and countries in our region where sometimes unusual depreciation and other investment incentives exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accelerated depreciation will now be available for all plant and equipment assets with lives of over five years and for industrial buildings and tourist accommodation. This makes our tax treatment of investment competitive internationally and, I believe, will encourage business to invest in Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Large benefits are available at the longer lived end of the assets scale, with plants with effective lives of 20 years now eligible for a 20 per cent declining balance write-off over 7.5 years. Together with the development allowance, which was also announced in the statement, these changes will create substantial benefits for major projects, particularly projects eligible for the development allowance of over $50m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the various elements of the depreciation changes are concerned, as I said, they emphasise longer lived assets. It is the Government's view that depreciation arrangements currently in place for short lived assets are fairly internationally competitive. For medium life assets, there are some changes which bring them more into line with international practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> document contains a comparative set of block graphs which show the position of Australia in respect of depreciation, following the announcement, compared with a variety of other countries. That shows that, even in the treatment of longer life assets, we are still behind a country such as Germany. On the other hand, the corporate tax rate in Germany is currently 65 per cent, I think, and we have a 39 per cent corporate tax rate in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people expected a return to 5:3 depreciation. I am not saying that Senator Watson did&mdash;I see him nod his head&mdash;but some people asked for that. We took away 5:3 as a government when the 39 per cent corporate tax rate was introduced. Then, 5:3 was a distortion in the taxation system because it gave effectively the same depreciating life to an asset of 30 years as it gave to an asset of six or seven years, for example. That was a significant distortion in the tax system. The proposals announced last night do not carry that distortion with them.</PARA>

The fact of the matter is that there is no income at all at present from an offshore banking unit. The 10 per cent taxation will apply to income which this country would never otherwise get. It is not to be compared with the personal tax or the company tax regimes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe, and Mr Greiner believes, for example, that there is great advantage in facilitating the development of offshore banking facilities in Australia. The danger about offshore banking facilities is that domestic banks will use them to try to obtain the lower tax benefit which applies to offshore banking. That has to be carefully fixed up in the legislation. When Singapore introduced offshore banking it found that there were one or two indications of abuse of that system. The relevant bankers were told that they would have to leave Singapore at 8 o'clock the following morning or they would be in gaol at 9 o'clock. They have had no further trouble there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to be careful to make sure that the legislation is rigorous in terms of penalties in respect of any abuse of that system. I think that it creates an opportunity. I do not think that it is in any sense detrimental to the well-being of Australian taxpayers generally. In fact, it will add taxation revenue which would never before have existed if that opportunity had not been offered.</PARA>

I know that Opposition senators such as Senator Short believe that history began the day John Hewson announced his plan for a new tax-led recovery. To look at history in terms of this post-recessionary experience in the Australian economy is very instructive. In the three years following the 1982-83 recession&mdash;that is, the recession of those opposite&mdash;this Government delivered growth of 6 per cent, 5 per cent, and 4 per cent.

Just as our relationship with Great Britain has undergone an extraordinary structural and historic change, which some people in the Party opposite do not seem to accept, so has the trading relationship of this country changed.

Increased Commonwealth and State government borrowing requirements are expected to be offset by lower borrowings by the Wool Corporation and the Wheat Board. Beyond that, the net PSBR is expected to decline to about 2 per cent of GDP in 1995-96. The expected fall in the net PSBR after 1991-92 is basically a reflection of the expected decline in the Commonwealth Budget deficit, which is referred to in the statement, and the other elements of the public sector are expected to have broadly offsetting movements in their net borrowing requirements over the period.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am answering the first part of Senator Vanstone's question, which was: can individuals or small groups make their own independent agreements? Most of the awards of the Industrial Relations Commission, particularly in the private sector, are minimum rates awards. The normal characteristic is that workers and employers agree to overaward payments either collectively through their union organisation or individually with their employers and sometimes in small groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So please do not propound the continuing fantasy that bedevils Mr Howard and assumes that there is no discussion in most Australian workplaces between workers and employers about whether or not individual workers are entitled to an extra margin above what the minimum rate prescribed by the Commission might be. It is the normal characteristic of the workplace. I have to say that in larger workplaces the normal characteristic is that that is done by direct overaward negotiation with the union. None of the features in the new industrial relations system that we will introduce will change any of that.</PARA>

The Minister was silent on the question of whether there will be any negotiation about terms and conditions, which can be just as important as salary rates. Will he allow any negotiation on matters that are not in an award? Do any changes have to be upwards?

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BCC Australia Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg SA) the holding company for the BCCI group of companies, was incorporated on 2 August 1985 to engage in merchant banking activities.

This enquiry has not revealed any failure to comply with the provisions of the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BCC Australia Limited because of the nature of its activities, was a cash dealer for the purposes of the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 and as such was required to comply with the reporting requirements of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 17 December 1991 following an arrangement with the Australian Securities Commission (ASC), officers of the Cash Transaction Reports Agency (CTRA) together with officers from the ASC conducted an inspection of the accounting records of BCC Australia Limited.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the CTRA audit was to ascertain whether or not the Company had complied with the reporting requirements of the Cash Transaction Reports Act. The result of CTRA enquiries cannot be made public as the secrecy provision of the Act (Section 25) prohibits the disclosure of information obtained by a person in the course of performing duties under the Act.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In cases like this where some taxpayers may be obliged to compute taxable income prior to the enactment of announced legislative changes, the Commissioner of Taxation has advised that taxpayers who make the computation reasonably based on the announced changes or, in this case, the amending Bill will not be subject to penalty tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand the honourable Senator has been advised to this effect by one of the Commissioner's senior officials.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>Mr President in reply to a question from Senator Baume from Tuesday's question time I offer the following.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Baume asked a question about youth unemployment and how my colleague the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services arrived at the figure of 8.8 per cent as the percentage of young people seeking full-time work and unable to find it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 8.8 per cent figure is simply the number of young people who are full-time unemployed as a percentage of the young people between the ages of 15-19 years. The 30 per cent figure is the number of unemployed young people as a percentage of young people in the full-time labour force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In asking his question Senator Baume alleged that the 8.8% was a `phoney figure' and that the Minister had claimed that the 30% figure was misleading. In fact neither is the case&mdash;as we have already seen 8.8% is the correct figure to describe the number of young people who are unemployed as a percentage of the teenage population.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is phoney is Senator Baume's constant use of the 30% figure as if 1 in 3 of all young people in the teenage population are unable to find a job. I refer to his press release of 16 February which boasts that there are `No Jobs For 1 in 3 Young Australians'. Granted Senator Baume gets it right in the text of his release but the implication is clear; Senator Baume wants to make the situation sound even worse than it is. He wants people to believe that every 1 in 3 of all the young people in the 15-19 age category are unemployed. In fact what we have is a situation where the majority of young people in the age group are in further education. About 1 in 10 of all young people in the age group are unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, no one on this side of the Parliament thinks that youth unemployment at it's current level is satisfactory but Senator Baume and others of his scaremongering type delight in making it sound worse.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is phoney is the Opposition's Fightback package which has absolutely NOTHING specific in the great thumping doorstop of a thing (because that's about all it's good for) for young people who are disadvantaged, that is the type of young people who Senator Baume sheds crocodile tears for.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only thing they say is that they will abolish the Youth Bureau which amongst other things administers grant programs for disadvantaged young people. They will abolish the CES not realising that abolishing them also abolishes Youth Access Centres which are designed to help young people especially the disadvantaged. What vision! What foresight!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concerning the second part of the question that Senator Baume raised in his supplementary question, no-one has ever claimed that the youth unemployment rate is less than the adult rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If one were to calculate the share of unemployment in the total population, the figure would be 6.5 per cent. No-one has ever suggested that this is the true unemployment rate amongst adults&mdash;because obviously the great bulk of the 5 million or so adults who are not in the labour force are not doing anything of immediate relevance to the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The same does not apply to young people&mdash;the great bulk of the 537,000 15-19 year olds who are not in the labour force (either full-time or part-time) are in education and training, which is of direct relevance to their future labour market prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the only people who have been misleading in this debate are the Opposition&mdash;who continue to pretend that a 30 per cent youth unemployment rate mean that 30 per cent of all young people are unemployed. That is manifestly untrue and Senator Baume's righteous indignation is just an indication that he has been caught out.</PARA>

<PARA>When one looks at the statistics outlined in this publication it is easy to understand the extent of the problems associated with family law. Since 1976 a total of 642,246 divorces have been granted and last year the figure of 42,635 was regrettably an increase on the previous five years. Over half the divorces involved children, with some 44,000 children having been caught up in family break-ups last year alone, and 750,000 since 1976. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against this background it is regrettable that the court has not had any increase in the number of mediation centres, as was intended, in Melbourne, Dandenong and Parramatta. Apparently it comes down to a matter of resources. Given the evidence to date that has been taken by the Joint Select Committee into Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act, we have been given the impression that mediation is successful and needs to be made more available. One hopes the Committee will be able to help in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another interesting comment made in the report by the Chief Justice relates to costs. He has introduced a practice direction requiring solicitors during litigation to give their clients a written estimate of costs incurred to date and likely anticipated costs. During the parliamentary inquiry the question of expenses in the legal process has been constantly raised. I also note that the Chief Justice refers to the establishment of the parliamentary inquiry, and remarks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Court welcomes public scrutiny and sees the enquiry as an important opportunity to extend community awareness of the Court's work and of the problems it faces.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, the Senate can take a bow for having agreed to set up the inquiry. It was interesting to note that before the inquiry was established Justice Nicholson left me in no doubt that he saw the inquiry as unnecessary and an intrusion into the court's work. Having met him and having noted his remarks in this annual report, I now know that he realises that we are here to try to help improve the position in terms of scrutiny of the Family Law Act. I hope that at the end of our inquiry everyone will agree that we have achieved something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the court welcomes the extension of community awareness, it is a matter of continuing regret that so much of the proceedings are forbidden to be publicised or reported in any way.

I hope that the next annual report of the Family Court will be able to report favourably on our parliamentary Committee's final report on the proposed changes to family law. I also hope that the work of our Committee will make things better for people who get to the stage of litigation in the Family Court. </PARA>

<PARA>The opening comments in the report by the Chairman of the War Memorial Council reveal that the year 1990-91 was a significant one for the Memorial. There was a new organisational structure, a new director and a new corporate plan. Another significant and unfortunate event was the ill-fated decision to introduce fees for entry to the Memorial. The Parliament in February 1991 judged that this was simply not appropriate for our national War Memorial, and the fees were subsequently removed. It was certainly not appropriate that veterans and war widows, those who have sacrificed so much for our country and whose sacrifices are embodied in the concept of a national war memorial, were required to pay to enter the Memorial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was staggering to learn, therefore, that it was only after the fee had been rejected that the Memorial Council commissioned a paper on funding options. This clearly should have occurred at the outset. It reflects badly on the decision making processes of the Council and Memorial management. Clearly, no decision should have been taken until there had been a thorough consideration of the options. If the only option to ensure the continued development of the Memorial's activities was an entry fee, then the Government should take a good look at the regard in which it holds the Memorial and the resources it gives to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The entry fee saga was not the only controversial event at the Memorial in 1990-91. The drafting of the new corporate plan was criticised by me and others for a mission statement which intellectually undermined the raison d'etre of the War Memorial. At one stage it omitted a clear statement of the Memorial's true purpose. I am glad to say that this was finally included after public pressure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both of these decisions, I believe, reflect the need for formal representation of ex-service organisations on the War Memorial Council. It could easily be argued that decisions such as that concerning entry fees would have taken a different course had there been ex-service organisation representation on the Council. Dr Hewson, the Leader of the Opposition, indicated last year that the coalition in government will ensure that such representation does occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also of concern that in the current financial year there have been a couple of situations in which the management of the Memorial has not distinguished itself. The first was the sacking, at short notice and contrary to earlier assurances, of several security staff and their recall on the same day, following the intervention of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second situation concerns the restricting of guiding at the Memorial. In the face of absorption of the training and affairs of Memorial guides into the education section of the Memorial, and the insensitive and uncooperative manner in which this was occurring, a number of those voluntary guides&mdash;some of them very experienced&mdash;have resigned over the past 12 months. There have also been reports of guides being asked to restrict tours to an hour or less, to bypass commemorative areas, and to be selective in how they describe sensitive events such as the Banka Island massacre of the nurses and the shooting of Vivian Bullwinkle by the Japanese. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wrote to the Minister on these and other matters of concern in December of last year. In the Minister's reply in January he sought to reassure me that such reports were not entirely accurate. However, the letter and the concerns raised in it have certainly had a noticeable impact. Since the Minister's reply and, I understand, a preliminary expression of interest by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> in the matters raised in the letter, the approach of Memorial staff has changed noticeably. I trust that this will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the annual report, the Chairman laments the prolonged public criticism of the War Memorial as destabilising. It must be stressed that the Memorial has an emotional foundation and an emotional legacy and that there will always be great interest in how the affairs of the Memorial are managed. It is widely recognised that the Memorial is one of the finest of its type in the world. Any criticism levelled at the Memorial is only out of a desire to ensure that it continues to uphold its traditions and to maintain its standing as a fine and respected institution. With its already proud history, I am sure it is the wish of all Australians in this year of fiftieth anniversary celebrations year that the sentiments of the Chairman are realised when she says that the Memorial is entering a new and positive phase of its history. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industry Commission report on the Australian dairy industry raises great concerns within the dairy industry, particularly in my own home State of Victoria where the majority of dairy producers are in business. The report comes at a time leading up to the need for new dairy industry legislation, as the so-called Kerin plan reaches its sunset date on 30 June of this year. The establishment of the Kerin plan in the early 1980s was a difficult process in an industry which, between the various States of this country, was fraught with difficult and competing interests. It was to the credit of this chamber, particularly the role played by my former colleague Senator Michael Macklin, and to Minister Kerin that that plan came into place and has operated since.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New legislation is necessary. The Government must not write that legislation along the lines of the report that the Industry Commission has put down. To date, we are unclear of the Government's position. I want the Senate and the Government to be clear on the position of the dairy industry, particularly in my own home State of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission report makes a number of recommendations which can be summarised by saying that it speaks of vastly reducing many of the current interventions that are in the industry. The dairy industry is very concerned about the consequence of those reductions in intervention. The Industry Commission recommends removing price distortions, ensuring that the industry has flexibility to adjust to changing circumstances, that least cost locations are used for milk production relative to market outlets, and a number of other items. The consequence of that, according to the Commission, is an expectation that prices for milk will go down by some 12 per cent. The potential effect on dairy producers is quite catastrophic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These, we must remember, are amongst the most efficient dairy producers in the world. That should not be forgotten, particularly when they are, in the export context, competing on a very unlevel playing field. The farm gate price of manufacturing milk would decline by between 5 and 9 per cent, or 2c or 3c per litre, and the prices of manufactured dairy products would fall by around 12 per cent as these market support payments were reduced&mdash;if the Industry Commission report were pursued. Total milk output would contract by around 5 per cent, putting dairy farmers, many of whom are currently only just scraping a living, right to the wall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important, I think, that we acknowledge the efficiency and effectiveness of the dairy industry in our Australian economy and particularly in our Australian community. For every dollar that a dairy farmer in this country creates, an additional $3.66 is created in his or her community. This creation of wealth is dependent upon continuing support for the dairy industry and will be very much at risk should the report of the Industry Commission be pursued and lay the basis for the Government's new legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to put the Government on notice that at least the Democrats understand that our dairy industry does not play on a level playing field; that no such playing field exists; that we cannot ask dairy farmers to go to the forefront in an international situation which is unfair to them; and that we must not risk that industry, nor must we risk the many rural communities that are dependent on that extremely efficient Australian dairy industry. The loss of skills and the loss of export income that would come as a consequence must be borne in mind as the Government drafts new legislation to replace the Kerin scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too wish to speak to this matter. I would also urge the Government to think very carefully about the recommendations of the Industry Commission in its report on the Australian dairy industry. It is all very well to take a philosophical attitude to this industry without putting it into a proper perspective in terms of its position in the community at large.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the dairy farms are relatively small in acreage. They do not have enough room to advance into broadacre farming such as beef farming. Many of them are in areas where the topography, the climate, the soils or various other things may not be suitable for cropping and where this opportunity does not exist. If we were to take the sorts of actions that would follow the adoption of the recommendations of the Industry Commission, we could further hurt very severely a lot of what are regarded as lesser rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems facing rural Australia these days is the continuing drift from the country to the cities and the lesser number of farms and the loss of community units. There is no reason at all why the sorts of recommendations that have been put forward should be adopted at this time. The dairy industry has made fantastic advances in efficiency and productivity. The manufacturing industry has done a great deal in terms of getting into the best lines with the higher profit margins, particularly in the cheese area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian cheeses that have come on to the market in the last 10 or 15 years have been absolutely magnificent. Instead of there being just a bulk market of sending product somewhere overseas for on-processing, the cheese is now produced in Australia. The Australian people are now consuming considerably more cheese than they used to, and the market overseas for particular varieties is improving all the time. As far as my home State is concerned, we have three manufacturers&mdash;Lactos, United Milk Products and King Island&mdash;all of whom are producing product which is keenly sought in many parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this is going on and while these advances are being made, there would be no justification at all for adopting the sorts of propositions that are put forward. The industry needs a continuation of the present scheme for further consolidation and further profitability. The manufacturing industry was in terrible trouble a few years ago. Nearly every company in Australia was bankrupt or almost bankrupt. In the main, they have now settled down, with many amalgamations. The business is now profitable and should be encouraged to continue in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economy, generally, requires micro-economic improvements in order to pick up and it is absolutely necessary that transport costs, general costs, marketing costs for exporters, the introduction of a tax regime that would allow exporters to be treated much better than they are at present, and matters of that sort are addressed at this time. I certainly urge the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) who is in the chamber at the moment to recommend that the Government not follow all the recommendations put forward by the Industry Commission in this instance, but proceeds on the basis on which the industry is currently operating. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too wish to address very briefly the Industry Commission report on the Australian dairy industry. The substantive issues which concern the Australian Democrats in the State of Victoria have already been put on record by Senator Powell. However, I wish briefly to commend Senator Archer for the comments he has made and lend support to the position that he has adopted which is essentially an interventionist one to assist the dairy industry. In that sense, it departs considerably from the position advocated on economic issues by the coalition parties which generally tend to think that the free market forces should be allowed to operate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, however, I am very glad to see that there has been a very enlightened response, a response that calls for government action. It rejects the essentially very dry position adopted by the Industry Commission and recognises that the dairy industry in Victoria and throughout Australia is of extreme importance. We as a community need to decide whether we are prepared to perhaps pay a few cents more for our cheese and other dairy products to ensure that the farmers in Gippsland and other areas in Australia survive and continue to be part of a viable dairy industry in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The annual report of the Australian Dairy Corporation seems to fit in very well with some of the remarks made about the Industry Commission report into the Australian dairy industry by Senator Archer in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the Corporation on its annual report and the work that it does in trying to enhance the profitable production and marketing of Australian dairy products. On 27 November, when this report was before the Senate, I made a few remarks but was unable to complete all that I wanted to say. Our dairy foods are as good as, and in many cases better than, any in the world. Our dairy food exports earn more than $700m each year. More than 100,000 Australians have jobs thanks to the dairy industry. The industry provides about 20 per cent employment in a number of important dairying regions. This is especially important in light of the particularly difficult times rural Australia is experiencing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Studies show that for every 100 jobs in dairy factories an additional 110 jobs are created in associated regional activities. The flow-on effects beyond the region are about as large again. Currently, Australia's dairy industry manufactures many specialised products for markets here and overseas. Its farmers currently produce milk valued at some $1.7 billion each year, all of which is processed within Australia. On top of this, processed dairy foods are valued at about $4.5 billion a year, an added value of $3 billion annually. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry's major investments in research, technology and market development will see these export earnings grow. Dairy farm productivity is increasing by 5 per cent per year, as it has for the past decade. The industry's willingness to adapt to change means that it will benefit from even minor reforms in the international trading environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already, Australians buy premier quality dairy foods at prices as low as anywhere in the world. Our farmers produce milk at lower cost than those in Europe, the USA, Canada or Japan thanks to our pasture based farming. In fact, few countries can produce quality dairy products as cheaply as Australia. Australian consumers are now paying the lowest prices in the world for dairy products&mdash;although I sometimes wonder when I go shopping at the weekend whether the women shopping in the supermarkets think they are paying the lowest prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dairying is a very real industry&mdash;close to the people it employs, part of everyone's day-to-day life, and earning export dollars for all Australians. In the south Burnett where I live we have a number of dairy farms. Unfortunately, the number has been reduced over past years. If the Government introduces many of the recommendations of the recent major study by the Industry Commission into the dairy industry, which we were looking at earlier, many more dairy farms will indeed face extinction. These recommendations could cut the average farm income by up to $21,000 per year. It is no wonder that Senator Archer said that he hoped the Government would not act on all of the recommendations of the Industry Commission report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already, a significant scaling down of the Queensland dairy industry has been undertaken to remove any areas which cannot compete with interstate and trans-Tasman competition. The number of farmers in Queensland has wound down from 20,000 to 2,000 in recent years. These farmers have quotas and are obligated to supply fresh, quality dairy products 365 days of the year. I compliment people who are in the dairy industry. It is a constant job. If they want to have a day off they have to find somebody who is willing to come in and do their work for them, otherwise they can never have a holiday. I pay tribute to those people who help to keep the dairy industry going. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Ombudsman's annual report for 1990-91, I intend to confine my remarks to the section on the Australian Taxation Office. I remind the Senate that the written and oral complaints received by the Ombudsman show the importance and necessity for his office. The Ombudsman's office received 362 written complaints and 839 oral complaints with a 76 per cent and 75 per cent resolution respectively in favour of the complainants, the taxpayers. Without this office, at least 600 taxpayers in this country would have felt that their rights had been denied by the Taxation Office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ombudsman and his office are an important check on the activities of the ATO, especially for those taxpayers who are involved in contentious issues and who have arrived at a stalemate in their negotiations with the office. Further, the cases handled by the Ombudsman show clearly those areas where procedures and regulations practised by the Taxation Office need revision and change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was pleasing to note that the effect of self-assessment, electronic lodgment and the establishment of problem resolution offices has resulted in a decrease in the number of oral complaints involving unreasonable delay in the issue of assessments and refund cheques. I congratulate the Taxation Office on its achievement, particularly those officers who staff the problem resolution section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, hand in hand with congratulations come areas within the Taxation Office that need revision. I was interested to note from the report that the main ongoing issues in the tax field continue to be, first, delays in the processing of interest payments under the Taxation (Interest and Overpayments) Act and in giving effect to tribunal and court decisions pursuant to section 200B of the Income Tax Assessment Act. A second issue is the offsetting of credits for debits not yet due. I believe that for the Ombudsman to single out these two areas signifies a potential weakness in the workings of the Taxation Office. I have had constituents come to me concerning both areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that several branches of the Tax Office consistently fell below what could be viewed as a reasonable level of performance; that is, to finalise more than 90 per cent of the cases within 30 days of issuing amended assessments and refunds of tax overpaid. The Ombudsman makes quite a point of stating that in 30 per cent of all interest on overpayment cases received in 1989-90, the Tax Office had failed to meet its own standard of finalising payments of interest on overpaid tax within 30 days. This is despite the issue being brought to the attention of the Tax Office the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ombudsman is also very harsh in his criticism of the Tax Office in failing to comply with section 200B of the Act. If a taxpayer's objection or appeal is successful in the AAT or the Federal Court and results in a refund of tax overpaid, the effect of section 200B is to require the Tax Office to refund the overpaid tax within 60 days of the decision becoming final. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ombudsman is convinced that the Tax Office is not fulfilling its responsibilities under this section. The Ombudsman has recommended that the Tax Office's computer systems be upgraded to enable it to issue interest cheques simultaneously with amended assessments. The Ombudsman's report states that on 28 June of last year the ATO reported that its office was investigating the problem and would remedy it after the full extent is known. I hope that since this was in June the Tax Office has attended to this problem. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator McMullan, whether this has been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also highlights the difficulties being experienced by taxpayers resulting from the Tax Office's practice of applying tax refunds to tax debits which are not yet due and payable. This problem is particularly prevalent amongst provisional taxpayers. I have already called for a significant reduction in the uplift factor that is applied to provisional taxpayers as a result of the present economic climate. For a provisional taxpayer to be denied his refund is adding insult to injury for this class of taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Ombudsman states that the Tax Office has implemented a policy of paying the credit to affected taxpayers on request using manual transactions, as its present computer systems are not sophisticated enough to handle this type of transaction automatically. The Ombudsman's office continues to receive complaints relating to the practice of offsetting all or part of a refund against a debit assessment. Therefore, this is an area that the Tax Office needs to correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also highlights the need for the Tax Office to record all of its settlements in writing and explain the penalty situation to the ordinary taxpayer. This only reinforces my persistent call in this chamber for all taxpayers to have certainty in their dealings with the Taxation Office.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak to the Ombudsman's annual report for 1990-91. In the overview of this report attention is drawn to the issue of the Ombudsman's jurisdiction to investigate program related actions of the ABC. It seems that in this respect, as in a number of other areas, the SBS is well ahead of the ABC because, while the SBS accepts the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the ABC for some reason does not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Cameron, who became the fourth Commonwealth and Defence Force Ombudsman in April of this year, believes, like his predecessor, Professor Pearce, that he does have the right to investigate the way the ABC dealt with a complaint it received. As Mr Cameron notes, there exists a clear need for this dispute to be resolved by the Parliament in the form of a legislative amendment. The alternative is costly litigation between two government agencies at taxpayers' expense, which is to be deplored.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators would be aware that on 14 August last year Senator Herron introduced a private senator's Bill seeking to address this. The Bill makes it clear that the Ombudsman's jurisdiction should extend to the ABC, and it is a Bill which ought to receive the support of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note the comments of the Ombudsman with respect to his power to report to the Parliament. As the situation stands, the Ombudsman may report to the Parliament in three ways. After submitting a special report to the Prime Minister, it is then within the powers of the Ombudsman to forward the report to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives for presentation to the Houses of Parliament. On the two occasions that this power has been exercised in the past 15 years, no substantive response was forthcoming from the Parliament. The Ombudsman might also submit from time to time a report to the Prime Minister for presentation to the Parliament. Finally, of course, there is the annual report. In none of these cases is there a direct link between the Ombudsman and the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report the Ombudsman relates the circumstances of his equivalent in New Zealand. There, the Ombudsman is an officer of the Parliament and is funded separately from the agencies of the Executive Government. In my opinion, this arrangement has a great deal to recommend it. After reading the report, one cannot help but see that in pursuing its charter the Ombudsman's office suffers from severe financial constraints. This can be directly linked to its dependence on the Executive for its budget allocation and the great uncertainty that must necessarily exist from year to year in its funding. That situation could shortly start to seriously affect the capacity of the Ombudsman to meet his obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are very serious concerns not to be taken lightly, because the implications of an emasculated administrative watchdog will be an increasingly self-serving rather than public-serving Commonwealth administration. In terms of funding and in terms of a charter to answer directly to the people, the idea of the Ombudsman as an officer of the Parliament has, I believe, great merit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration was reviewing the office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman and has now reported. I believe that important recommendations flowing from this review are only worth while in so far as the Government responds to them quickly and effectively. With a staff of only 72 and a budget of $4.4m in 1991, the Ombudsman and his staff have performed well in their efforts to meet the increasingly heavy demands placed upon them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a senator in this place, I must say that the work of the Ombudsman is of great value to me in representing my constituents, particularly because he alone is able to go into a department and read a file which is not given to any of us to do which often, of course, results in a change of attitude on behalf of the department concerned. Certainly, in looking after defence constituents, I find that the defence Ombudsman is a very valued adjunct and participant in the democratic process. It would be very bad indeed if we were to allow the Executive to starve such a worthwhile organisation of its resources. To place it under the responsibility of the Parliament itself, to me, seems much the best way to go. </PARA>

I have not had a reply from Mr Beazley, but I have received one from Ms Wendy Fatin who is now the Minister for the Arts and Territories. It is interesting to note that although I raised concerns about this issue, together with the concerns of Southern Cross Homes in New South Wales&mdash;which sent me a petition from some 170 people saying that they were disgusted with the fact that the Government was in the game of handing out money to organisations funding these types of operations&mdash;Ms Fatin did say in her reply that, amongst other things, to stop these types of corporations wasting money on this type of production, they must qualify under a test under division 10BA of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ms Fatin said that this test ensures, amongst other things, that those programs are of broadcast quality or suitable for public exhibition in the cinema; that a film which received a rating more restrictive than R would not be considered a qualifying film; and went on to explain why this particular film only received an R rating. Hence, I am speaking on this film today because the film did receive an R rating but was banned in New Zealand. I think that is a reasonable example of beauty, or whatever one likes to call it, being in the eye of the beholder. Even though we gave that film an R rating here, it was banned in New Zealand, so obviously someone there thought it was a pretty poor production. </PARA>

I raised that group last year through my Waste Watch Committee and pointed out that it was advocating male prostitution as a way for students to work their way through college. The Minister then gave me an assurance that its funding would be reviewed. This obviously was not done because I notice that this group has raised its head again in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Catalyst</EMPHASIS> magazine. This year, after receiving $200,000 worth of funding, it advocated killing the Pope, going out graffiti writing and engaging in other anti-social behaviour.

The point I am making is that, while we are in Opposition, my colleagues and I will continue to raise matters of concern about the funding of some of these way-out projects and, in this particular case, the funding of a pornographic movie using $270,000 of taxpayers' money through the Office of the Film and Literature Board. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>It was only yesterday that I spoke on a report of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, which is very much connected with the Great Barrier Reef. The annual report of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority deals with the reef itself. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is off the coast of Queensland and Queensland is very proud of it. As I said yesterday, I consider the Great Barrier Reef to be the eighth wonder of the world. It is really a marvellous, God-made place. So many people love to go there and see it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The park is the only large marine ecosystem in the world which is comprehensively managed with the explicit goal of ensuring that its use is ecologically sustainable in perpetuity. In discussing the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority annual report, I want to focus on three brief issues. In the chairman's report he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As managers, we are acutely aware that our scientific knowledge is insufficient for us to be certain that our goal is being achieved.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, there are three major questions about the park which still remain unanswered. One of them&mdash;the cause of the crown-of-thorns starfish infestations&mdash;has been extensively studied over the past few years. An enormous amount has been learned in these studies, not only about the starfish but also about the processes and other living organisms which constitute the Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only recently I read that sophisticated computers are currently providing help in protecting the reef from starfish. The article said that a team of Townsville-based marine scientists, using supercomputers to model the larval dispersal of the starfish, have revealed its spread and predicted future points of infestation. The results have confirmed the basic southward drift of the starfish and the high incidence of outbreaks on reefs around the middle of the Continental Shelf. They also showed that reefs such as Green Island and John Brewer Reef are more susceptible to infestations because of their connection with upstream reefs, and that the area around Cooktown acted as a partially self-contained source of larvae and a possible site for the start of future infestations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article went on to say that the modelling program they are trying to establish up there involves feeding data on prevailing tides, winds and the east Australian current, together with the physical make-up of individual reefs, into supercomputers with very fast processors, large disc capacity and a high system input. Another instrument which is proving very helpful in monitoring the activities of the reef is the video camera and photographs. These are used to record in detail the effects of the reef's predators as well as the long term effects of tourists. Of course, many tourists visit the reef and that is one thing they have to be careful about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first tests in this program have begun at Michaelmas Reef, a popular tourist spot near Cairns. As I was looking at the report, I found a very interesting photograph of Michaelmas Cay, a very beautiful island on the reef which I have had the privilege of visiting a couple of times. There are a tremendous number of birds on the island. As I looked at the photograph, it brought back memories of my visits to Michaelmas Cay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This research on Michaelmas Reef will help to provide warnings of any adverse changes from overuse by tourists as well as the harmful effects of oil spills, cyclones and commercial and amateur fishing. In a recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>, a project officer with the authorities said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In ten years of monitoring we will be able for the first time to see any gross changes to the reef.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to say one thing about the worry over the crown-of-thorns starfish. Captain Cook had to off-load a lot of luggage when his ship hit a reef while sailing up the Queensland coast many years ago in 1770. In order to lighten his ship he also had to have five cannons thrown overboard. Not so very long ago a team of people found the cannons. Believe it or not, quite a deal of the reef had grown over them; they had to be dug out of the reef. So it is quite obvious that the reef continues to growth, despite crown-of-thorns starfish attacks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, we are very glad that we have the Barrier Reef off our Queensland coast. Many tourists who come to Queensland just love to visit the reef. </PARA>

<PARA>I preface my remarks by paying tribute to the immediate past Director of the Office of Australian War Graves, Alf Clarke, who died on 15 December last. I knew him for only a fairly short time, but his heart was very much with the war graves office. He died very shortly after his retirement. I offer my condolences to his family and express my appreciation of the love and care which he gave to the Australian war graves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to mention briefly my pleasure at having been included in the official party as a representative of the Opposition at the fiftieth anniversary commemoration of the Fall of Singapore Week which was held a few days ago, and at the Battle of Australia in Darwin commemorations a week ago. We met with sons and daughters who perhaps had never known their fathers who were prisoners of war of the Japanese in Singapore and Thailand. We met with widows who, for many years after the war had ended, had cared for veterans disabled as a result of their war service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We attended a terribly moving ceremony in the mist very early in the morning at Kranji war cemetery in Singapore where an international ceremony was held to remember the dead. Again, on the following morning, the Sunday, the 8th Division had its private family service. Many of the families had come to Kranji for the first time and they remembered the members of their families who had made the supreme sacrifice. As an Australian, I was very proud to see a detachment from the 1st Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment, which is currently serving in Butterworth, Malaysia. Members of the battalion came down to Singapore to provide a guard of honour for the ceremony. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All Australians would be very pleased to see how well Kranji cemetery is kept by the Commonwealth War Graves, to which Australia makes a contribution. So many of our dead lie buried there. It is a beautiful cemetery and I urge Australians visiting Singapore to make sure that they visit it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The annual report of the Office of Australian War Graves briefly mentions that in the past year the Office also arranged, on behalf of the Department of Defence, 54 memorials for Australian service men and women who died in service in the past year. There were eight from the Navy, 35 from the Army and 11 from the RAAF. We do not often realise that being a member of the Australian Defence Force is a very dangerous occupation. Even in peacetime, training has to be realistic and people do die. I take this opportunity to make sure that people are reminded of the contribution that is made even in peacetime in training to defend this country from war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One very disturbing thing I noted while reading this report is the fact that in most States there has been an increase in vandalism of Australian war graves. South Australia, Hobart and Launceston are picked out for particular mention. The war graves office is now trying to combat the problem in the major war cemeteries and gardens of remembrance by investigating security systems suitable for use when staff are not on duty. It is a terrible commentary that we should have so allowed a lack of respect for our dead to grow in our society that people are prepared to commit acts of vandalism against war graves. I alert the Senate to something which I have noticed in reports. I am appalled to think that this is a growing problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One innovation I draw to the attention of the Senate is a backpackers guide that is being produced by the Office of War Graves. This will assist visitors backpacking in France and Belgium to find their way around the Australian battle sites in those countries. This guide commemorates the seventy-fifth anniversary of the arrival of the AIF in France and Belgium in 1916. The leaflet will be distributed through our embassies and airline offices and should be of assistance to all who visit the battlefields of World War I. That is an imaginative way of hopefully trying to educate people to respect what the young men of this country have done for this country over the years. </PARA>

<PARA>The Government's so-called free health care system has led to a grossly inefficient and unstable health care delivery system that can no longer be sustained. One of the things that surprised me greatly in last night's statement was that health has yet again been neglected by this Government. I am sure that will be of great concern to Australian citizens, especially the elderly, many of whom are languishing on so-called `elective' waiting lists for medical treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Broad public acceptance of some of the features of Medicare, such as its universality and the availability of free medical and hospital services, has until recently hidden very serious deficiencies in the system. But no longer are those deficiencies hidden. They include a massive rise in hospital waiting lists and rising costs of private health insurance which have been largely due to the massive decline in the population holding private health insurance. The appeal of the so-called free health system has led to the widespread drop-out of people from the private health care system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overburdening of the inadequate public health care system has led to massive waiting lists and an under-utilised private system. While more than 60,000 people languish on those waiting lists for public beds for elective surgery around Australia, private hospitals have average bed occupancy rates of only 55 to 60 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Private health insurance costs have increased markedly as the private funds have had to cope with the declining membership and, in many cases, a more costly membership as the young and healthy give up their membership of the funds. The newly unemployed&mdash;the thousands and thousands of them&mdash;who now cannot afford to take out private health insurance are also added to that list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The annual report of the operations of the registered health insurance organisations highlights the decline in the numbers of people with private health insurance. At 30 June 1991, 43.5 per cent of the population was covered by private insurance at the basic table level. Only 12 months ago, 44 per cent of the population had this level of coverage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report shows the steady decline in membership of private health funds since this Government came to office. The table indicates the decline in membership from 50 per cent in 1984. In fact, the proportion of the population with private health insurance has fallen from 67 per cent in 1982, when this Government came to office&mdash;and this report only goes until June 1991. I was in Mildura only a couple of days ago and people there were talking about the number of people who had fled the private health insurance system since then. So I am sure that if the figures were up to date they would be even more devastating. All the people who formerly had private health coverage now require treatment in the public system which, as I have said, is greatly overburdened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the Government's solution to the crisis in the private health care system? It comes up with a proposal to nationalise our private health insurance market and to create one single private health fund&mdash;a typical and predictable response from this Government. However, the coalition has responded to the problems in the health care system by developing a comprehensive blueprint as part of its Fightback package that will restore the incentive to take out private health insurance and provide the correct balance in the system between public and private resources. Under our policy there will be financial incentives to take out private health insurance. There will also be an expansion of private insurance options. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The annual report tabled today also highlights the massive defunding of the reinsurance fund&mdash;a turning away by this Government and a neglect of the health of this nation. As I said last night, it gives cold comfort to those working in the health field and those needing the services of the health providers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I start this debate, which is on a notice of motion which was moved last year, by quoting from an article which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> headed, `The cost-price squeeze hits the farmers' under `Economics Extra' by Michael Stutchbury. He says at the beginning of the article:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pain in the bush reflects the long-run cost-price squeeze on Australian farms.</PARA>
<PARA>Last December, when I drew the attention of the Senate to some quite startling figures on the state of the rural economy, I mentioned that the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics had announced that farm incomes had fallen by a tragic, massive 75 per cent in 1991. For Australia it is a crisis of quite significant proportion. The net value of farm production in 1991 was $21 billion, the lowest net value since 1982. Farm cash operating surplus fell from 1989-90 to 1990-91 by 40 per cent and is expected to fall a further 18 per cent between 1990-91 and 1991-92. Farm business profit fell by a massive 357 per cent between the financial year 1989-90 and 1990-91 and is expected to fall a further 67 per cent between the 1990-91 financial year and the 1991-92 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures are averages across all farm enterprises. For some, the situation was and remains far worse. For sheep and beef producers there has been a 178 per cent drop in profits, and even for specialist beef producers, who according to ABARE have had a pretty good year, farm business profits slumped by 100 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been warning the Senate for quite some time now about how, even though interest rates might have fallen lately, all the input costs have built into them the high interest rates of the regime that was imposed on Australian farmers by the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since those figures were released, the Government has staged its 1992 Agricultural Outlook Conference. The news at that conference was that prices for Australia's major export commodities would remain weak and that the net value of farm production would sink further to another record low. It suggested that, despite considerable economising on costs, farmers would still suffer a further drop of 16 per cent in net farm cash income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The considerable economising farmers have undertaken includes sacking staff. In fact, farming employment has dropped from 152,000 to 140,000, while the figure for unpaid family helpers has jumped by 50 per cent. That means that children are being removed from school, often before their schooling is completed. It means that farm wives are becoming the stock hands on the property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many cases it has meant the husband going off farm to look for work or take stock on the road while his wife takes on the full time running of the farm on top of her other duties, also full time, with the children. I do not need to remind the Senate that Australia until recent weeks has been affected by drought over several States. The Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs has been looking at the treatment of drought and the Federal Government's approach to drought funding. We have travelled to all States except Victoria and interviewed or taken evidence from 170 witnesses. The witnesses have been a broad spectrum of those involved in the process&mdash;from agricultural departmental officers through to consultants and to counsellors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly, the Committee has travelled to drought affected areas and spoken directly with farmers affected. We have seen the devastation, the despair and the desolation. I cannot describe to anyone who has not travelled to Cobar in New South Wales, to Roma in Queensland or to Esperance in Western Australia just how serious the drought has been for the people in those areas. But what is most depressing is the overwhelming sense of hopelessness that we as outsiders felt, yet those families, whose livelihoods and all they had worked for were about to be lost, still had the most tremendous courage and, surprisingly, very little bitterness about a situation that in so many cases was simply not of their making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time and again the story was repeated. We heard of the family that had 80 per cent or more equity in their properties but were encouraged to buy the farm next door for their sons or to economise their operations. They bought in good faith and with reasonable expectations of being able to meet repayments. Many borrowed at 12 per cent only to see commodity prices fall, unanticipated abandonment of the reserve price scheme for wool, and interest rates jumping to 18 per cent, 20 per cent or even higher. I have it told to me many times that many farmers are in trouble only because they took too many risks and were too greedy. That has not been the case. Farmers have not been greedy, but have been very long suffering in the past eight years of Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What woolgrower could have predicted that the Labor Government would abandon the reserve price scheme, particularly when the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy at the time, Mr Kerin&mdash;apparently the farmers' friend&mdash;said that if there was any movement in the reserve price it would be up, not down, and certainly not out. He was quoted at the time as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rural sector is vital to our national economy and the rural community is vital to our national identity. This has always been the case in Australia, and it's not about to change.</PARA>
<PARA>They come as cold words of comfort now that he and the rural sector have been decimated. But given such assurances as those from the Minister, what farmer could have anticipated that interest rates would double in a matter of a few short years? Who could have anticipated such a massive and widespread collapse in commodity prices? Who could have predicted that on top of all these other factors farmers would first be hit with a flood, as Nyngan was, then a drought and then another flood all within a period of four years?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to remember that farmers have been caught in a desperate cost-price squeeze for the past 20 years. Since 1973-74 prices paid to farmers for their output have doubled, but prices paid by farmers for their inputs have jumped 4 1/2 times. I ask honourable senators to think about that. How would people react if their household budgets had suddenly jumped in that way? How can anyone prepare adequately for a string of disasters against that background? The simple answer is that they cannot do so. It is history that the number of farms is reducing as is the number of farmers. In the year 1989-90 to 1990-91 the total number of farmers dropped from 243,000 to 228,000. That reduction will accelerate, I anticipate, this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly based on figures given to the drought inquiry in Queensland and Western Australia, there has been a significant increase in the number of farmers moving from the sound to the doubtfully viable category. Previously, 20 per cent of farmers in Queensland were borderline; that figure is now 30 to 40 per cent. In Western Australia at least 6 per cent of farms are not viable long term, with a further 33 per cent suffering short term difficulties. Half the 30 to 40 per cent of farmers in Queensland I mentioned basically have no future at all, and this was said to us by the Queensland Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crisis in rural Australia has been developing for a number of years, and most certainly during the entire period of the Labor Government. But I draw the Senate's attention to just how much Labor has done for this most vital sector, a sector which still, despite its adversities, produces 27 per cent of export income. In outlining the specific attacks that the rural sector has suffered from successive Keating budgets, let us not forget the greatest legacy the former Treasurer, now Prime Minister (Mr Keating), left this country, and that was a record period of record high interest rates. That alone was of sufficient magnitude, but Mr Keating's abuse of rural Australia went even further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me quote to the Senate what I heard the Prime Minister say today at the National Press Club: `Draconian high interest rates slow the country down'. He was making a claim that some of the policies that we will put into place in government after the next election may cause high interest rates, which they will not. The Prime Minister&mdash;Mr Keating, the former Treasurer&mdash;did cause high interest rates to prevail for far too long, which caused so much harm, so much hardship, and knocked all the confidence out of the business sector. So what has happened to the farming community is on his head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1983 the Labor Government cut general depreciation allowances and abolished special depreciation allowances for on-farm fuel storage. That same year it scrapped the in-out opting arrangements of tax averaging and increased the margin paid by farmers under the fuel freight subsidy scheme, and it automatically indexed excise taxes to CPI and imposed a new tax on fortified wines. The year 1983 was a big one for Labor's rural bashing campaign&mdash;Senator West should be hiding her head under her desk&mdash;because in the Budget of 1983 the Labor Government abolished sales tax exemption on oils and lubricants for farmers. Labor imposed a 200 per cent increase in export inspection charges and abolished tax incentives on income equalisation deposits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The year 1984 was a little quieter. The wine industry was the only one targeted with the introduction of a 10 per cent sales tax on wines and alcoholic cider. In 1985 the petroleum products freight subsidy scheme was emasculated and the subsidy on LP gas abolished; capital gains tax was introduced and on-farm water conservation was changed from immediate write-off to a five-year schedule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1986 the fringe benefits tax was introduced by the Hawke-Keating Labor Government, along with a further 3c a litre increase in fuel excise, a 20 per cent tax on wines and an increase in agricultural quarantine fees. That was not a bad year for a little bit more bashing of the rural community by the Hawke-Keating Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987 we saw a cut in wool research funding by $5m and the fuel freight consumer component was lifted. In 1988 the Hawke-Keating Labor Government did another job on those of us in country areas. Export inspection charges were increased again and fertiliser subsidies were abolished, along with immediate write-off for electricity connection, changes to depreciation allowances which cost rural industry $90m, wool promotion funds were cut by $20m, the export trade incentives programs were cut by $78m and primary industry levies were increased. If some of these things had not happened it would have helped the rural community, but these all put more costs on the rural community. Indeed, primary industry levies were increased by $105m largely through lifts in the wool tax and livestock slaughter levies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time we have had further increases in export inspection charges to 100 per cent cost recovery and cuts to CSIRO rural research. Furthermore, this Labor Government has made cuts to soil conservation, cuts to isolated children assistance, and drought aid has been removed from the national disaster relief arrangements. Furthermore, family allowances have been assets tested, which has effectively eliminated most farm families, no matter how cash poor they are. All those things were done in the space of eight years to the rural communities. One wonders now why the rural communities are in the state they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already referred to the great calamity perpetrated on the wool industry last year by the Federal Labor Government. The wheat industry suffered no fairer fate. Today both those industries are experiencing historic difficulties. I suppose that, given the long list of destruction I have just detailed, we all ought to be grateful that wool and wheat growers actually received a mention in the statement from General Custer last night. The Prime Minister told Parliament that we should help farmers during the recovery phase. I have read the much-ado-about-nothing-much package launched last night. I will not go into the arithmetic of it because I do not believe that there was any. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that, despite all the indications that help was forthcoming for the rural sector&mdash;a sector suffering the most extreme crisis in the history of this country&mdash;farmers rated only a total of 14 lines, and five of those lines had only a couple of words in them, out of a total of 16 pages. We had the Prime Minister suggesting only hours earlier that help was on the way&mdash;and 14 lines was all the attention Australian farmers get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot be ungrateful. In those 14 lines there was a one-off addition to the rural adjustment scheme. Farmers can now borrow even more money to plant crops this year. The Wool Realisation Commission will be allowed to make cash payments to woolgrowers in the event that sales from the stockpile occur faster than anticipated. Some much needed extra funds are to be provided for rural counselling services, and I welcome that. Depreciation allowances will assist those farmers who have sufficient equity to make new machinery purchases. But remember all the things that have been taken away before they get a little given back. I do not think that is what the rural communities have needed in the last eight years&mdash;take a little away and then give a little back. There was so little when so much needed to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have an industry in crisis, and we get crumbs and tinkerings. There was no question of underwriting this year's wheat crop so that farmers would have confidence to risk capital in planting. Last year saw a record drop in the size of the crop. We cannot afford to have another small national harvest because we will jeopardise our traditional markets if we cannot supply them. Despite evidence provided by almost every single witness to the drought inquiry to the effect that the income equalisation deposits scheme had to be made more effective, despite the fact that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has been made aware of this, again nothing was done about the income equalisation deposit scheme. Once again, farmers are being left to get out of their crisis the best way they can, with short term solutions and not long term strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has done the homework for the Government on assistance for the rural sector. We spelt it out for the Government in our tax reform package. Obviously, the Government has read bits of it because it cribbed some of it last night, but it ignored the strategies for rural Australia. Last week the Agricultural Council failed to adopt a national drought policy, but we were told that it would do something about it in July. Last night the Prime Minister failed rural Australia yet again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot imagine a more dramatic set of figures than those the rural sector presents at the present time. What more needs to be done to make the Keating Labor Government realise that the rural sector is on its knees and that something has to be done? What does it take to get these soft-bellied Ministers on the other side of the chamber out into the real world? The country is dying and the Prime Minister is playing drop-the-hanky in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My notice of motion in December last year was presented to the Senate when Mr Hawke was still Prime Minister. Since then we have had a change of Prime Minister. But despite all the media hype, the re-imaging of the honourable member for Blaxland, rather like a new advertising campaign for an old product, nothing has changed. It is the same stale, pie in the sky, trust me, I am wrong, thinking that we have learned to ignore over successive failed Budgets, economic statements, mini-Budgets and assorted packages. The disaster of massive proportions which I alluded to last year is even more apparent today, and the Federal Government stands condemned for its selfish navel-gazing arrogance. It has remained oblivious to the disaster it has created for a major sector of Australia's economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I finish with a quote: `Burn down your cities and leave our farms and your cities will spring up again as if by magic; but destroy our farms and the grass will grow in the streets of every city in the country'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was interested to hear the contribution of Senator Brownhill on this notice of motion. Once again, we have not had outlined clearly just what the Opposition would do if it were in government and what the impact of its proposals might be. I will endeavour to look at some of those proposals later and also to touch on some aspects of that reference to General Custer, which I found most interesting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government does not deny that farm incomes have dropped. Farm incomes have dropped for a number of reasons, which really have not been outlined very well today by my colleague opposite, Senator Brownhill. Of course, it comes as no surprise that the Government does not accept this notice of motion. The Opposition clearly has chosen to overlook a worldwide recession; to ignore what is happening in the rest of the developed world, and I presume to an even worse extent in the developing countries of the world. We see massive unemployment in the UK, the USA and the EC countries. That must have an impact on farming, on food commodities that people must buy and on their general purchasing power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see turmoil in certain parts of the world, particularly in what used to be the USSR, now the CIS, or the Commonwealth of Independent States. Those states cannot agree on what they will do about their defence policy. They cannot agree on what they will do with their defence forces&mdash;who should have which parts of them. Before I am pulled up because my remarks may seem irrelevant to the motion, I hasten to add that the USSR was a very large importer of Australia's wool and I am outlining to honourable senators the impact of this turmoil in the USSR on our markets for this commodity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our third largest purchaser of wool is in a great state of turmoil and has a problem paying its way in the world. In the last several weeks we have witnessed food aid being flown in to provide the people of Moscow and other cities with enough food to stop food riots. We have heard people speaking against Yeltsin and the current leadership of Russia. We must hope, holding our breaths, that the regressive, reactionary conservative forces that ruled the Soviet Union prior to the rise of Gorbachev are not able to overthrow those people who are attempting to bring about some reform in that country. That reform is a slow and long process. It must have an impact on our wool market particularly and to some extent on our wheat market. We must not forget that because it must have a major impact on our markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter that has been overlooked is the corruption of the markets. We have the USA to thank for its export enhancement program. We have the EC to thank for its common agricultural policy. Both those policies work in competition. It is like two elephants fighting: the ants underneath get trampled. In some markets we just happen to be the ants because those two bodies have attacked some of the markets we share in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our time here would be much better spent on actually arriving at a decision on how we can send messages to the EC and the US in an attempt to convince them that the GATT negotiations must continue, and must also have a result that will turn around the activities and the gross subsidisation that these two major groupings involve themselves in. We certainly sent the message very clearly to the US when President Bush was here. We certainly spoke at length to the US press corps which attended with him. Members of the Opposition were very good and vocal at doing that. Unfortunately, I do not recall seeing many of them doing it when the British press corps visited here last week. They were more intent on saying that we should look to Britain and kowtow to Britain, and that we were not doing things correctly. </PARA>

We have not heard the Opposition acknowledge that in yesterday's statement $20m was set aside for a crop-planting scheme and RAS funding. This scheme will be funded purely by Commonwealth money and will assist farmers in need to plant this year's summer and winter crops. I say `crops', not just wheat.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During our hearings relating to the drought on the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, as has been alluded to, one of the issues that we were confronted with by grain growers was concern that those who were in financial difficulties would not be able to access funds to put in a crop once the drought broke or once the season changed. This will enable those people to access funding purely for that purpose. They will be able to plant their crop and get their cash flow moving again. That needs to be praised and noted for its usefulness. We also need to note that it is for crops and not just wheat. It is exceedingly important that we recognise that. I recognise the value of the wheat farmers but I also recognise the value of other primary producers and other grain growers. There are many other sorts of grains. </PARA>

It would appear that those opposite want to put farmers in a separate category and exclude them from the benefits of the other programs that will occur&mdash;the one-off family allowance payment and the increase in the family allowance supplement. These will help farming families, although one wonders whether the Opposition recognises that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in supporting my National Party colleague Senator Brownhill in the debate on this motion. I have listened with interest to what Senator West has been saying. She wanted to know what the coalition was going to do for rural people. I suggest that she read the Fightback package completely, because the coalition parties realise the important part that farmers play in the economy of Australia. She told us that there had been a downturn in returns to farmers. We quite realise that. But she forgets to mention the increased costs and imposts on rural producers brought about by this Labor Government. That is one thing she did not mention or bring to our notice at all. Senator Brownhill in his speech outlined a lot of the assistance to primary producers that has been removed by this present Labor Government. It is no wonder that so many of them are in such a disastrous plight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made many speeches in this place about that problem. The Labor Party likes to talk loudly about social justice, but rural people apparently are not part of its social justice program. Its economic policies have already been ruinous to anyone trying to contribute to the productivity of the nation. Those of us who inhabit this nation are all Australians. Last night the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) tried to claim in his blueprint for a bankcard led recovery that we are all together as one nation. But I tell honourable senators that we are two nations in terms of financial opportunity: those who are fortunate enough to live in metropolitan Australia and those discriminated against by living in rural or remote Australia. It is this Government which has created these two nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has done nothing to try to bridge this rift. Indeed, its policies have contributed to a disturbing widening of the gulf between these two sections of our nation. This Government has demonstrated that it has no interest in those non-metropolitan Australians. Its neglect effectively punishes those who, for a variety of reasons, choose not to live in the cities and big rural towns. To be a non-metropolitan Australian under this Government is to be second class&mdash;a member of the B team; a reserve grade Australian. Last night's document purporting to be for one nation and for all Australians seems to conveniently forget the hundreds of thousands of people who live outside metropolitan Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was there in the document for rural Australians? Nothing much&mdash;only a few meagre crumbs. But we know that this document will not underwrite the price of the coming season's wheat crops to restore confidence in that industry. It will not change the income equalisation deposit scheme&mdash;an excellent scheme for people in rural Australia&mdash;to make it an effective insurance policy against low incomes. Regrettably, the Government does not intend to abolish the wholesale sales tax in order to save farmers $170m a year. The Prime Minister will not abolish fuel excise, which is paid on nearly 50 per cent of fuel used on farms and pushes up the cost of transport used to move goods to and from farms. I think that that excise is probably one of the most evil things that has been imposed over the years. Of course, the Government will not bite the bullet and implement a national drought policy, despite the severe drought conditions that have hamstrung farmers for the past 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion from Senator Brownhill shows that the Government's own body&mdash;the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, or ABARE&mdash;confirms that farm incomes were slashed by a massive 75 per cent last year. There is no hope being offered for these people by the economic statement. Instead, as this motion suggests, any recovery will be too late for the hundreds of thousands of farmers who are already bankrupt, financially and emotionally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as though this Government has simply turned its back on rural problems, letting them fester by callous neglect. I believe it is worse than that. Its policies have actively worked to make things worse. I have heard many speakers in this place and in the media argue about the merits of free trade and the abolition of tariffs, but I have yet to see any significant benefits flow to our rural sector. Only hardship seems to be the end result. Australia has been building its tariff policy around its commitment to the Uruguay Round of GATT. We are told that it is necessary for Australia to reduce its tariff barriers to demonstrate our good faith at GATT and to encourage the larger, more powerful nations to demonstrate that they will follow our lead. However, I believe it is quite clear that this philosophy is not working. The EC and other countries have failed to respond to any of the initiatives taken by Australia and other trading nations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am telling Senator Cook my position on this matter. As far as I am concerned, I do not believe in imposing tariff cuts. This came under a considerable spotlight when we addressed the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. In that debate the Government outlined how it intended to set what it calls a `level playing field' for the motor vehicle industry; the textiles, clothing and footwear industry; the vegetable industry; and the sugar industry. What concerns me greatly is that it did this without regard to the impact of its policies on the competitive conditions within which producers in each of those industries work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In following this policy we are really saying that because we are on the altar of free trade, because we want to be able to hold our hands on our hearts and say to the Europeans, the Americans and the Japanese that we are acting as we believe they should act, we will be in a better position to ensure that they do so. Unfortunately, in doing so we place a number of our major industries in a position where there will be even more unemployed; where there will be an even larger number of those engaged in those industries who will be shutting up plants and moving offshore; and where, in many rural sectors, we will find that imports will take over their market share. Regrettably, even with the peanut industry and the fruit growing industry, we are finding that imports are taking over the local growers' share of the market. Reductions of tariffs in these areas as some sort of grand gesture, while they are not being matched by our trading competitors, is a warm inner glow nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, no-one can ignore the impact of all the arguments and evidence about the effects of this tariff war on Australian farmers put to the President of the United States when he was here in January. George Bush simply indicated that his job was to protect American farmers first and not leave them to the mercy of such trade wars. I ask honourable senators why this Government does not do the same for our own people instead of, in effect, selling them down the chute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What makes it even more criminal is that we are doing so after people have committed their life savings in what has been an economically difficult time and, thus, their continued economic viability is threatened. We have not made a level playing field.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major problem we have is on the international scene where we are not getting a fair go in trade; Australia is proving to be lily white in the area of trade tariffs and no other country seems to be following along that avenue. This makes a mockery of the Labor Party's promise in the 1983 rural policy speech in Griffith to an unqualified commitment to maintaining the viability of Australia's great rural sector and the provincial infrastructure. The Federal Labor Government has not lived up to this commitment. Effectively, it has stripped away from Australian agriculture those measures which shielded it from the corrupt practices of the international market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already made, in the past few years, what seems to me to be quite a lot of speeches on each of these subjects as they not only become more and more critical to our national financial welfare, but also involve the disintegration of a lifestyle and society which has served Australia well in the past. If we fail any of our rural industries now, we will see the disintegration of rural Australian society as many of us have known. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been very distressing to note that the profound shift in Australia's export earnings from farm products to other economic sectors has left primary producers with shrinking incomes. These changes mean that we cannot afford simply to sit back and wait for the farm sector to be virtually depopulated. That is really what is starting to happen all over Australia. It is not only happening in the South Burnett where I come from, but also in so many other rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government cannot claim that the rural crisis has only just hit. It has been warned continuously for years and the evidence to show just what is happening outside our major cities has been around for quite some time.

They are still allied with the Government to persecute our farmers with the deregulated banking system, the dismantling of import tariffs&mdash;and I am sure Senator Bjelke-Petersen is interested to be reminded of that&mdash;and the reduction of government intervention in markets and in what are known as government business enterprises. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this very chamber not very long ago, we heard Senator Archer speak about the Industry Commission's recommendations with regard to the dairy industry. I agree with much of what he said, but I would like the coalition to take note that Senator Archer was listing the many reasons why that Industry Commission report and its recommendations on the dairy industry should not be adopted, should be refused out of hand. Those very reasons were the sorts of social benefits which derive from having a successful dairy industry located outside our metropolitan area, an industry which should not have to compete, just on price, with imports.

I wonder at the commitment that the coalition has towards this dry economic view of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder why we have to put up with the Opposition's crocodile tears about the problems that are being faced by our rural producers. The Opposition then fails to support the sorts of tangible Democrat moves that we could take to effectively support our rural areas, ranging from removing the assets test for Austudy recipients to a moratorium on tariff reduction. Senator Bjelke-Petersen often speaks in rural debates. I am disappointed that she has not stayed. I was going to remind her of her own speeches in which she often speaks against tariff reductions. The Fightback package, which is thrust in front of us so often as the saviour of all the evils in the rural sphere of Australia, proposes to reduce tariffs, as Senator Cook has reminded us, in a much more drastic way than is proposed by the Government at the moment. On the one hand, the coalition is complaining about the situation and, on the other hand, it proposes an even worse situation for our farmers. </PARA>

It has to be admitted that there are good, tangible and useful aspects in the statement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One economist commented at the last Agricultural Outlook Conference that recovery has been six months away for three years&mdash;or four years, or five years or the length of this Government. To my knowledge, the recovery in the rural sector has been coming since 1986-87. Every time the Government looks at it, it is six months away. As a result of the decisions that have been taken by this Government and certain industries, the 1990s is likely to be the worst decade in the rural industry for many decades. Australian farm families will be facing their most difficult decade with increased adjustment pressures from changes in technical, economic, environmental and institutional conditions facing agricultural industries. This Government neglects this section of the Australian community time and time again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outlook for many farmers, particularly those with smaller enterprises amongst the broad acres, is very much one of trouble. Farmers are making considerable savings&mdash;they have to. In the farming game, if one cannot see the dollar coming in the door, one has to economise in certain sections to survive. One can make cuts, use less inputs here and cut something else there. It has to be done to survive. People just cannot keep borrowing to get them by in this long drought&mdash;not `drought' as in rainfall but drought as in rising prices and neglect by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though farmers have made cutbacks in costs, net farm cash income is forecast to drop by 16 per cent to $3.2 billion in 1991-92, following a 40 per cent decrease in 1990-91. When allowance is made for depreciation on plant, stock and those sorts of things, the real net value of farm production is expected to fall by 42 per cent to $398m in 1991-92. That is the lowest on record. I repeat: $398m is the total net value profit for all farmers in Australia. That is a very damning figure. Wool, wheat, cotton and sugar producers are expected to experience large drops in income. There are a few bright spots existing: meat has always remained reasonable while dairying and horticulture are probably on the up. But, in general, the whole of the agricultural industry in Australia is suffering badly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had two very savage years in a row. That has had a terrible effect on the industry. There was a drought in the eastern States last year. The Government says that it is not responsible for the drought. Of course it is not responsible for the drought. But the Government certainly claimed credit for breaking the drought in 1983. If the Government claimed the credit then, I suppose it is fair enough that we blame it for what is happening now. We had a disastrous wheat crisis in the 1990-91 season. It was disastrous because of the actions of the European Community and the American export enhancement program. We have to accept world prices. The only way that we can turn around our productivity and any profit that we make on farms is to minimise our costs. That is the only way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Australia's primary industry has now come to the end of its worst two years, one would have thought that the Government's One Nation package which was delivered last night would have given rural industry more than the half a dozen lines it did receive. Rural industry could have been in a much better position, and the Government would not have had to do quite so much in this package, if the Government had taken the right decisions in the last half a dozen years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, let us look at the IED scheme&mdash;the income equalisation deposits&mdash;that Senator Brownhill and Senator Bjelke-Petersen mentioned earlier. We had a good scheme going which commenced in the Fraser years. Unfortunately, when Senator Walsh was the Minister for Finance&mdash;and I tell him this any time I talk to him about it&mdash;he perceived that there was a rort in the system. He has never been able to explain so that anyone can understand why there was supposed to have been a rort. Anyhow, he decided that there had been a rort, the IED scheme was changed and it was useless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will turn to the figures I have on equalisation deposits. The first year for which there is information available is 1978-79. In that year there were deposits totalling $66m; in 1979-80, $79m; in 1980-81, $136m; in 1981-82, $163m; and in 1982-83, $165m. Unfortunately, 1982-83 is about the time that this Labor Government was elected and the IED scheme changed. So the following year, 1983-84, it went back to $155m; in 1984-85 it was $130m; 1985-86, $94m; 1986-87, $67m; 1987-88, $48m; and in 1988-89, $34m. We can see how it was drained out. If the IED scheme had been left in place as it was, those savings by farmers would have been there to be used in those tough years. But no, the Government took them away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So while those good years&mdash;the high wheat price years&mdash;from about 1982 to 1986 were quite good right through to 1988, the rural industry was not able to use the IED scheme and it simply paid out money to the Tax Office and it was gone. The Keating Treasury got hold of that money and the bank was bare before the tough years started. That is one of the decisions that this Government has made that has gone awry. The rural industry could have been in a position to keep itself right to get over these tough years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move to wool. During an exchange with, I think, Senator Brownhill about the reserve price scheme, I heard Senator Cook say that the Government was the first to want to do away with the reserve price scheme. I have been advocating since 1986, before I came to this place, that that scheme was not right and that it should have been done away with. I have always advocated that here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the coalition decided it was time for that scheme to go and was advising the Government that it was time to go, what did we have? We had Mr Kerin in China, the United States and Italy&mdash;and in Italy they do not forgive you for breaking promises too well; they have ways of making you remember that you have made a promise. You get a mark against you, generally on the right side of the face, so I would say that Mr Kerin should not go back to Italy! He gave a cast iron guarantee that that reserve price would stay at either 700c or 900c&mdash;I will be corrected if I am wrong. Within three weeks it was gone. No wonder we have no credibility in China, Italy and the United States. If he knew the price was going, why did he not say he would dream or hope it would stay? He gave them a cast iron guarantee, and there it was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we had done away with it earlier and not had that big stockpile and big debt, the wool industry would have been far better off. We had a wool Bill in this Parliament last year on which, amongst others, I spoke. The coalition arrived at a calculation that a 10 per cent wool tax was enough; it was ample. Even the Democrats believed it because they supported us in the first place and we got it up. I remember debating with Senator Cook across the chamber on certain figures. Now the call from the Wool Commission is to cut the wool tax. The<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Countryman</EMPHASIS> dated 13 February 1992 states:</PARA>

<PARA>The article states, `The coalition moved a successful motion in the Senate for the 10 per cent tax', as I said, but then the Democrats caved in and gave the Government 12 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We said here time and time again that 10 per cent was ample. Now the Wool Commission has come up with the startling figure that probably 8 per cent is ample. If only the Government had made the right decision. We told it and told it. We told Senator Cook who led the debate for the Government. If the right decision had been made, farmers growing an average of 105 bales of wool per year would have had an extra $12,487 in their pocket. But no, the Government did not listen and the Democrats of course backed up that non-listening. That is another decision that the Government could have made that certainly would have helped primary industry, and it would not be in the depths of disaster in which it is now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us move on to the price of wheat and the wheat industry. Senator Bell asked, `Where's Senator Brownhill's economic rationale when he is calling for a GMP on wheat?'. I can tell you, Mr Deputy President. The wheat industry would not be in the strife it is in now if it had listened not to us&mdash;not to the Opposition&mdash;but to the Premier of Western Australia. Last year she gave a one-off and told the President of the wheat industry in Western Australia, John Walsh, that if he came back for a second time around she would throw him out of the office. She gave that one-off guarantee. We were looking at $115 a tonne this time last year when planting was coming up. She gave a guarantee of $150 which enabled the banks to lend with confidence to the growers needing money to plant crop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the One Nation statement delivered last night was a certain amount of money to help plant crops. Senator West made that point. But the point is, that sort of money has to go through this RAS&mdash;the rural adjustment scheme or whatever it is called on the other side. By the time it is decided who is worthy or needs that money or does not need that money, and when it is being done in the city rather than out in the bank branches, it is too late. The money comes through in July when the crop should have been planted in May. How can that work?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the whole nation had had a one-off GMP last year, that money would now be able to go out because the local bank deals with the farmer in his home town, knows the farmer's habits, knows how careful the farmer is and what he is like with money. The decision is made in the home town. If that had been done, we would now be in a far better position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now I come back to my point that the wheat farming industry could have revived far earlier than late 1992. You may know yourself, Mr Deputy President, that the price of wheat&mdash;the estimate of the pool return was only altered last Monday&mdash;has now reached $180. So in the last six months or less, it has gone from $115 to $180. If there had been a one-off GMP last year all around Australia and all the crop had gone in, many&mdash;I would say most&mdash;of those farmers who have a chance of surviving would have been in a far better position because they would have been receiving $180 a tonne, and that is guaranteed money in the bank as of the end of March. This Government could not do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Simon Crean, flagged this for one week. Then he must have been sat on either by Treasury or the Prime Minister&mdash;I do not know what happened&mdash;because he forgot about it. I am not looking any more for a total GMP on wheat; I am just looking for a one-off arrangement. The Government has put forward its One Nation program. If the Government had a one-off GMP this year&mdash;forget last year&mdash;then the farmers in the eastern States who may be battling to plant crops could do so with guarantees from their local banks. That could and should have been done this year. Senator West said that such an arrangement does not help other grain growers. I fully agree but a much smaller figure could have been provided to help out those growers. If this had been done, the recovery could have been achieved much earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator West also referred to the amount of money mentioned in the One Nation statement that will be set aside for road and rail. Like Premier Lawrence in Western Australia when she announced her package the other week, this Government is making a virtue of neglect. For 10 years this Government has neglected road and rail. It has now allocated an extra $600m&mdash;correct me if I am wrong&mdash;to upgrade roads. I do not have the figure for rail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Fraser Government, increasing amounts were spent on roads. The last figure was $1.25 billion. That amount has remained static in the 10 years since this Government came to power. Today in real terms that $1.25 billion a year should have been at least $2 billion. So on average, $4 billion, not $400m, should have been spent on roads in those years. Now the Government is making a virtue of having put an extra $600m into roads. The same goes for rail&mdash;the Government is only putting money in to make up for past neglect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural industry will be helped by the new depreciation schedules announced in last night's package. As Senator Button told us last night and today, under the depreciation schedules, claims on machines and buildings can be made over seven years rather than 20 years or 30 years. Unfortunately, very little is done for schedules which relate to periods of around five years. This is the period within which most farm machinery is written off. At Question Time today Senator Button told us that it is a rort to reduce the five-year period and, therefore, that arrangement will not be changed. What is the point of an improved depreciation schedule if the farmers do not have any money to invest in new plant? It is pointless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator West said that costs to farmers will rise by 15 per cent because of the 15 per cent GST. All input costs on rural industry are rebatable. Other items, such as food, baby's clothes and all that sort of thing, to which Senator West referred, will rise by an average of 4.4 per cent. So low income earners will be rewarded twice. If this Government continues to try to criticise the Fightback package, it should be truthful and put forward correct facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural industry is in a very tight situation. If the Government is prepared to make any decisions&mdash;even decisions arising out of this One Nation package&mdash;it still has time to put them into action. I hope that any good measures that are contained in the package&mdash;or any good measures at all&mdash;will be dealt with a lot faster than those contained in the statement on 12 March last year. The legislation containing the depreciation schedules that were announced at that time has not even hit this place yet. It has gone through the House of Representatives but it is not here. How much longer will it take to deal with any good measures that might be around?</PARA>

He would have heard and seen the position that many of the growers and producers find themselves in. It is not correct to describe this motion as historical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been challenged to mention some of the things that we would do in government, and I will come to that in a moment. But I want to refer to a couple of aspects of the One Nation statement which was brought down last night. One of the problems we have had in the rural sector and right across-the-board is the impact of high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many businesses have been forced to use their capital, and, in the process, have been forced to capitalise their interest. That is now flowing through into their ability to service their debts and their costs. The other impact of interest rates is that businesses have to pass their costs on to producers. In effect, in the end it is the exporters who have to pick them up. It is almost impossible for rural people and exporters&mdash;the people who pick up the total cost&mdash;to survive in the environment of high interest rates that was run by Mr Keating when he was Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time that I have left&mdash;and I am rushing through what I want to say&mdash;I want to address the pork-barrelling exercise we had last night. The big fear of that pork-barrelling exercise is that we will return to the high interest rate regime. We must be very wary of the impact of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say something about the rural adjustment scheme. Witness after witness told the Committee that the last thing that they wanted was more money. They said that they could not handle or service more debt, yet that is being put forward as one of the panaceas of the rural situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us now look briefly at wool. Is it not a marvellous gesture that if the Wool Realisation Commission makes a profit on the sale of the wool&mdash;the wool that is owned by the producers, the debt for which is being serviced by the producers, a wool stockpile in which they have a $2 billion investment of their own money&mdash;the producers will be paid back their own money? I do not know what the Government expected to do with the money before it brought this statement down but, in effect, it is saying that the farmers will get their own money back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn briefly to a number of things the Opposition has said it will do. The first thing&mdash;and this has been raised by previous speakers&mdash;is that we will return to and put in place a proper IED scheme. I want to quote from a producer who gave evidence to us at the drought inquiry the other day&mdash;a producer who is just about out of business today, with the combination of collapsed commodity prices and drought. In the last four years before the drought started two years ago that producer averaged $40,000 income tax a year. Yet he had no mechanism by which he could set aside money to protect himself from a downturn or a drought day. One of the first issues that will get our very high attention is a proper IED scheme that will allow people to become self-reliant and look after themselves, to smooth out their income flows, because agriculture is an industry that has very rough income flows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other step the Opposition will be taking, and it is very important for export industries, is looking at the system under which export regulation is applied. We will be moving towards privatising that and getting rid of the overmanning, the costs, the inefficiencies and the hindrances that apply in the current situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another means by which the Opposition will address rural problems&mdash;this comes straight from the Fightback package, and I make no apology for it&mdash;is that farmers, graziers and pastoralists will pay 26c a litre less for all petrol used on-farm for business purposes and 19c a litre less for petrol for personal vehicle use. Our proposed fuel reductions will also flow through to the transport companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard in the statement last night about road building, and one will not argue that we need a good road system. But it is important how that is done, whether we can afford it and whether it is funded. We did not see anything in the Government statement about how it will be funded. Under the Opposition's policy, with the abolition of the wholesale sales tax and the fuel excise, fuel reduction costs to the road transporters who carry our goods will be in the order of $53,000 per rig per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier today, the rail system pays fuel excise. The cost of that to the rail system represents some 20 per cent of the cost of carrying wheat on rail&mdash;or it was in Western Australia about four years ago, and I do not believe the relativities have changed. In addition, cuts will apply to Avgas. This will mean that the cost of aerial agricultural work such as crop dusting, superphosphate spreading, mustering and all the other tasks for which aeroplanes are used will drop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have outlined a number of the Opposition's policies which will benefit those in rural areas very significantly. Since we have little influence on the international scene, the Government should be addressing itself to getting rural costs down. It has long been the cry of the farmer organisations, whether it be the National Farmers Federation, State organisations or the commodity councils, that the way to allow agriculture in this country to remain competitive is to look very closely at the impost of taxation on inputs and get them off; and to look at the imposts on the infrastructure industries such as transport and get them off. This Government has done little or nothing about that. We will then be able to operate on the same basis as countries such as America, Canada, Argentina, Brazil and the European countries&mdash;the list is endless. They do not have the up-front imposts we have. That is something that could be done immediately, and it would certainly make a big difference at the end of the day to the profitability of the individuals within the industry. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating called it the One Nation statement, but it is really the `One Job' statement. Mr Keating got a job he did not deserve. His mismanagement of the Australian economy has resulted in untold disappointment and tragedy for hundreds of thousands of Australians. That he should be rewarded by his colleagues for that appalling record simply tells us of the depths to which the Labor Party has sunk in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Power has become a drug and the Government is intoxicated. The concept of service is forgotten. The New South Wales Right of the Labor Party, which controls this Government, referred to from within the Labor Party for its thuggery, governs this country for what it can get out of it, not for what it can put in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia did not choose Mr Keating to govern and they cannot wait for the chance to get rid of him. He had one opportunity. He could have called it the `One Opportunity' statement, to show that he could provide a vision and a policy to back it, and he muffed that chance&mdash;not surprisingly, because that is not why he was promoted. He was put there on the basis of his record of personal abuse as the one man the Government believed could blow John Hewson and his vision for Australia out of the water&mdash;just straightforward, simple, negative politics. Mr Keating's arrogance and incompetence and, to some extent, the Labor deals with its mates which locked him in led him to maintain the crushing interest rates which have destroyed so much of Australia's business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating, of course, has always known better. This was the recession Mr Keating brought upon Australia. There was no world recession that we got caught up in, no outside excuse. Mr Keating did this one all by himself&mdash;perhaps, Senator Button might say, with some help from others within the Government who have presided over industry policy for the last eight years. Mr Dawkins, now promoted to Mr Treasurer, and Mr Keating's mate, has done his best in recent years to wreck tertiary education in this country. Then there is Senator Richardson, who pulls the numbers and who sells out to any interest group which offers an electoral benefit. And there are a few others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The costs of Mr Keating's unnecessary yet deliberately engineered recession are enormous. The figures are staggering enough, but they in no way show the human misery they represent. The number of unemployed increased by 38.6 per cent between last year and the current year&mdash;900,700 people were unemployed in November 1991, an increase of 220,300 unemployed in eight years. Full time employment has fallen by 34.2 per cent since April 1983. To be parochial, if I might be excused for just a moment, in my home State of South Australia unemployment is now 11.9 per cent and youth unemployment is 37.5 per cent. Mr Keating, who said that under him we would never have a recession, gave us the worst recession in 60 years. He said it was the medicine we had to take. Now, in this unfounded pump-priming exercise, he has the gall to say to us:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This statement is very much about making this nation strong. It's about Australians realising that their destiny is in their hands.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not the people's fault that Australia is in such a mess. It is Mr Keating's fault. Here we are, with boundless opportunities, in the fastest growing region in the world, a small and reasonably well educated population, with enormous natural advantages, and we have record unemployment, record bankruptcies&mdash;up 154 per cent between 1982-83 and 1990-91&mdash;and record debt, with gross foreign debt having risen under Mr Keating as Treasurer to $166 billion at the end of 1991, up from $36 billion when he came to office, an increase of 362 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the legacy of the Hawke-Keating years, of their stewardship of the Australian economy. The key to Australia's problems lies in the ongoing current account deficit. Through wages indexed to the CPI and other mad policies of Labor, we ceased to be competitive in so many areas. It led to a crisis, a crisis which is still with us and which has been rekindled by last night's pump-priming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last quarter before Mr Keating became Treasurer, the current account deficit was $612m. Under Keating, as we know, it was often over $2 billion. Mr Keating's answer, instead of seeking to make Australia more competitive, was to force up interest rates to dampen demand. But in fact he pushed up interest rates until even the best run businesses were no longer competitive. Having destroyed so much of the economy, he now wants to buy an answer with money we do not have&mdash;the quick fix, the kick start, which puts us back into the boom-bust cycle from which we so desperately need to break away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dramatic contrast is offered by the coalition's Fightback package. It is fully funded, because we recognise the need to arrest debt, not contribute to it by the fiscal blow-out we are again experiencing. Remember Mr Keating, as Treasurer, saying not so long ago that never again would it be necessary for the Government to put its hand into the cookie jar of people's savings. Yet here he is, doing it again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Access Economics estimates a fiscal deficit of $9 billion this year, before Mr Keating's latest expenditure. Australia cannot afford to keep running this way. Fightback seeks to set the framework within which Australia can again be internationally competitive. It is structured to provide incentives to individuals and businesses to grow and to employ. It does so by offering cuts in business taxation of some $20 billion a year, fully funded, compared with Mr Keating's offer last night of less than $1 billion unfunded. And business taxes must come down if we are to be competitive. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only last month we learnt of a new OECD study which found that Australian business has to pay the highest rate of tax on new investment in the industrialised world, except for Turkey. Coincidentally, at about the same time the Business Council of Australia released a study showing that, of nine countries, Australia imposes the highest taxes on output for domestic sale except for Japan and the highest apart from Japan and Germany on production for export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback would allow a business tax structure which would be internationally competitive. As almost all the industrialised world has found, it cannot be financed without a broad-based goods and services tax, and Mr Keating knows that, too. That is why the Keating statement was flawed from the outset, if it ever was supposed to provide a more competitive economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback provides the framework for competitive labour relations&mdash;not lower wages as Mr Keating would claim but contracts tailored to the unique circumstances of a particular enterprise so that both employer and employee can benefit. The Labor Party has been dragged kicking and screaming to enterprise bargaining, but nobody really believes that it will deliver. Senator Cook made clear today that, despite the change of rhetoric, those opposite in the Government will not deliver. They do not even understand what it means. That is why Mr Keating's statement last night requires that such agreements must be registered with the IRC, the core structure of the centralised system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback additionally provides for real reform on the waterfront and in shipping, which Labor cannot deliver because Labor will not end the Waterside Workers Federation monopoly on the waterfront. Labor will not give stevedoring companies the right to recruit and manage their own work force. Labor will not privatise port authorities or end the Australian monopoly on coastal shipping, or terminate the trans-Tasman shipping agreement and privatise the Australian National Line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian transport must be at internationally competitive rates. Thus, under Fightback, and fully funded, we are able to abolish all fuel excise&mdash;$6.6 billion&mdash;55 per cent of which falls on business, and abolish wholesale sales tax which is an enormous impost on land transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a more competitive communications industry under Fightback we will open the telecommunications industry to full competition and commence the privatisation of Telecom. Labor, in response to its union accountability, does not have these options open to it. In addition, because we understand that we cannot have a competitive Australia without world class schools, university and other educational training, we commit a great deal to it. Because Labor has not a goods and services tax, it is unable to match that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again using my example of South Australia, I would point out that this year 34,319 students applied for university entrance, of which only 15,900 received offers. That is less than one in every two fully qualified South Australian school leavers who sought to get into university to further their education will not get the opportunity under Labor. Just as important as other initiatives, Fightback with the abolition of the wholesale sales tax and of course no GST on exports will mean that exports are cheaper and more competitive. Amazingly, Mr Keating's statement does so little to contribute to more competitive exports which are critical to our economic recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could go on because, in contrast to Mr Keating's statement, Fightback is not a knee-jerk reaction but an integrated fully funded package for a vigorous, outward looking, competitive Australian economy. Certainly some initiatives in his statement are stolen from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> I refer to the open skies policy so far as it goes&mdash;and it is a pity that the Government has only just now realised that a level playing field means fair access to terminals&mdash;the interstate electricity grid, the money for TAFE, accelerated depreciation. All can be found in the published <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document. Stolen or not, we are pleased to see it. Basically Mr Keating sees everything pretty much on track. All it needs is a kick along. But it is a track that has taken Australia to its current ruinous state. By contrast, we say that it is not the right track, and never will be when the forecast outcome is still unemployment of about 10 per cent. What we offer, we are proud to say, is a radical alternative, a real vision and a carefully crafted program to fulfil that vision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is too much complacency in the Keating statement, as there was in this week's analysis distributed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia and North-East Asia in the 1990s</EMPHASIS> and in practically every Government document that we see. It is a complacency that we find so frustrating. Mr Keating should read the World Competitiveness Report 1991, which was published by the highly regarded World Economic Forum&mdash;I think Senator Button might have attended their conferences&mdash;and the International Institute for Management and Development. That report compares 23 developed countries according to eight major groups of variables. Australia was ranked sixteenth out of 23 in 1991, just ahead of Italy, New Zealand, Spain, Turkey, Portugal, Greece and Hungary. </PARA>

Only 15.5 per cent of Australia's merchandise exports were manufactured goods compared with, say, Canada with 57.1 per cent. I use Canada as an example because it also is a major resource exporter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask those opposite to listen. They should read some of these items. Other areas in which Australia fared poorly were industrial relations, where we were twenty-second out of 23. So much for the Accord. In the area of protectionism, Australia was 21 out of 23. In railways and roads we were 19 out of 23, and as to port access 20 out of 23. These are factors that Senator Button should be taking into account rather than dismissing them in his usual way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is obvious is that, although Australia might be changing, others are changing more rapidly. We are not chasing static targets. We have not improved our position even in Asia, the fastest growing of all the markets. Even in the so-called `Son of Garnaut' report issued this week by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade there is an acknowledgment of Australia's failure to increase market share with this remarkable sentence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent years, Australia's export performance was strong enough to maintain market share in North-East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA>That is all we are doing with Labor's so-called reforms&mdash;at best maintaining our position. Australia's market share in North-East Asia in 1990 was 3.8 per cent, the same as it was in 1987, even lower than it was in 1984 when it reached 4.3 per cent. That is what is pathetic. Although most of the recent growth in Australian exports has been to Asian markets, which I accept, our market share is not increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw Senator Button's attention, as obviously he does not read these things, to another report delivered this week from the Business Council of Australia on participation of Australian companies in trade and investment in Asia. The report expresses the position in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is being pulled along in the slipstream rather than making a major share gain.</PARA>
<PARA>To us that is not good enough. Between 1985 and 1987, for example&mdash;this is what those opposite should be seeking to do in their stewardship of this economy&mdash;Western Europe increased its share of the Japanese market from 9.5 per cent to 18.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Asia is clearly the most significant trading area for Australia, accounting for about 50 per cent of our exports, but our profile in Asia, if resources are excluded, is very small. Primary products plus metals and basic manufactured metals account for 83 per cent to 88 per cent of goods exported. The real problem is that in the higher value added area we are not competitive. Under Mr Keating's economic policies of high interest rates and a high dollar it was difficult enough for our natural resource exporters to remain competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To recapitulate some of Professor Garnaut's main points, in his report, which the Government claims to have adopted as a recipe for a greater involvement in the expanding markets of Asia, Professor Garnaut said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's larger problem is that isolation has been greatly compounded by exceptionally high costs of trade at and beyond its borders&mdash;on the waterfront, in our civil aviation and high protection for manufacturing industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Garnaut also stressed the need for stable macro-economic policy to keep domestic expenditure on a steady, low inflation growth path&mdash;which, of course, we did not get last night. Here is Mr Keating again pump priming the economy in a way which must add to our current account, inflation and then interest rates. The same argument applies to the need for a more efficient tax system. I remind the Leader of the Government of the 1989 Hughes Committee report on Australian exports, which I would have thought the Minister would have read, which identified the lack of a value added type of tax as a factor reducing Australia's competitiveness vis-a-vis competitors employing the same systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have thought that this `Son of Garnaut' report produced by the Ministry this week would have made an assessment of progress in the micro-economic reforms so necessary to improve our competitiveness. But no, the report says that it does not discuss domestic reforms at length because it `was the most controversial part of the Garnaut report', because `debate on this issue has waxed and waned' and because `arguments have become blurred, as longer term structural change has been confused with short-term cyclical movements in the level of unemployment'. What a contribution!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ironic that whilst much of the report describes how the economies of North East Asia are adapting to the changing economic patterns of the region, the complementary changes in the Australian economy, which are allegedly taking place, are not analysed at all. DFAT, as is the style of this Government, gives much greater attention to the regulatory impediments in North Asian countries than to our competitive deficiencies. It is always easier to attach blame elsewhere. Analysis of the progress post-Garnaut is left to others. David Chessell of Access Economics analysed the Government's performance in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Independent Monthly</EMPHASIS> and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two years after the Garnaut report was delivered and therefore two years closer to the year 2000&mdash;the target date for most of Garnaut's reforms&mdash;we are still not showing enough speed or enterprise in seizing our opportunities in North East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA>That is why we feel so frustrated. That is why all Australians should have felt disappointed last night. When John Hewson announced the Fightback package he said that he hoped the Government would pick it up and run with it because it was essential for Australia. It is probably the first time the Opposition has challenged the Government to run with its policies. The Government has picked up a bit, but not much. This is not a government of political courage. There is no Coronation Hill in the statement, no abandoning of its restrictive uranium mining policy, and no GST, which even Mr Keating realises is essential for a real package of reforms. There is just enough, Mr Keating hopes, to build a bit of consumer confidence to get him home at the next election&mdash;just enough for him and his cronies to hang on to power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not good enough. What Mr Keating does not seem to understand is that the party is over. The Australian public knows how serious the problems are. They know that only radical reform to completely restructure the economy will be good enough. They know that finally they have an alternative government with the vision and courage to chart the necessary course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The future is in internationalising Australia; to seize the opportunities of the huge and growing markets around us&mdash;to thereby solve the problem of the current account and to provide sustainable jobs for so many more Australians. That is what it is to be internationally competitive, which is so necessary. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback</EMPHASIS> shows how this can be done. It shows what governments can and must do to contribute to a more competitive Australia. Mr Keating has missed his opportunity. It is a tragedy that so many innocent Australians as a consequence will miss theirs. These Australians at the first opportunity will pass the reins of Government to John Hewson and the coalition, and the Fightback, so desperately needed in this country, will commence. </PARA>

The Australian Democrats were ready to support such concepts and the moves designed to realise them. But they were words&mdash;just words. There was neither substance nor vision behind those words.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if there was no vision in Mr Keating's statement, there was also, and is, no vision in Dr Hewson's reply either.

There is no real vision in this mini-Budget of an Australia 10 to 15 years from now for the sort of society which we should have&mdash;whether that society will be fairer, more equitable, better educated, more creative, more caring and with an economic system that our environment can sustain. How will we run our economy in 10 to 15 years? Will the economy still run us, as it does today?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found in Mr Keating's statement only the apathetic shrug of the shoulders of one who, like his colleague in the Opposition, would sacrifice ordinary Australians to the idol of economic rationalism.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say that the Australian Democrats found the Prime Minister's statement without some value. We found some elements very positive. Work on the rail network is good, as far as it goes&mdash;which is not very far. Construction of a modern sewage plant in Perth is a step in an environmentally sound direction. The establishment of a group for the commercial exploitation of Australian research in Australia is a step that, as the Prime Minister himself observes, should have been taken years ago when the Xerox photocopier invented in South Australia fell for want of Australian encouragement into foreign hands. One can point to the atomic absorption spectrophotometer and a host of other world class inventions in this country which have followed the Xerox copier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are bandaids with which Labor is trying to staunch the haemorrhage from a mortal wound. The patient, the Australian people, the Australian economy, the Australian environment&mdash;indeed, the Australian nation&mdash;is suffering an iatrogenic disease. As a medical man, I must tell the Senate that the prognosis is dire, for the suggested treatment will continue to exacerbate the illness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement was supposed to be about jobs but, despite some obvious bribery, the One Nation statement does very little for the unemployed or for those Australians living on low incomes. It does not, for instance, even mention Aborigines&mdash;the original and most impoverished Australians. An Aboriginal activist telephoned me today and asked how the Prime Minister can talk of one nation without mentioning Aborigines and the jobs that are needed by Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the Prime Minister mention? He mentions a series of figures, and very unclear ones at that. For instance, do the 800,000 jobs Mr Keating is going to create over four years include the 200,000 jobs in tourism over 10 years? These jobs, as I understand Mr Keating, are dependent on the numbers of tourists tripling in the next 10 years&mdash;a factor, to a great extent, outside our control. The figure is a wish rather than a promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, the Government has failed to seize the moment and do what is most desperately needed. The statement One Nation confidently predicts that `the economy will turn around', and continues the parroting of the Treasury line that if the Government only stays out of things the economy will recover. Note the symbolism: the economy is not of our making, it is not under our control; people must become the servants of the economy and not the other way round. The problem with this view is that it accepts a high long term level of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One Nation predicts unemployment falling to 7.5 per cent in 1995-96. When put against the Fightback figure of 8.2 per cent in 1996, unemployed Australians are surely entitled to ask: where do we fit into either of these so-called grand visions of the future? The fact of the matter is that both the Government's and the Opposition's packages blatantly consign about 700,000 Australian workers to the employment scrap heap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to employment, once again both the Keating and Hewson plans for the country are sadly lacking the truly visionary quality that would have enabled ordinary working Australians to have some confidence in their future and the future of their children. The Government's package is especially disappointing in this regard because it had a very real opportunity to shift direction and actively intervene in the economy to create jobs. Instead, we have a mishmash of recycled ideas which cater to the financial markets and fail to target those areas most in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We welcome the increase in funds for labour market programs and apprenticeships, but the Government needs to triple its $2 billion investment if it is to make a realistic assault on unemployment. The $6 billion should be invested in infrastructure, job creation schemes and sales tax reductions to reduce inflation and wage demands whilst providing jobs for Australians. That $6 billion is still only 1.5 per cent of GDP. According to experts such as Access Economics director Chris Murphy, $2m will be lucky to cut unemployment by half of one percentage point. This is borne out by the Government's own figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To those who criticise our proposal as irresponsible, I say that it is the adoption of free market ideology that has been irresponsible.

To state, as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> does, that `the Government is not interested in make-work schemes which offer no hope of real employment' indicates the Government's lack of understanding about the range and the nature of potential job creation projects and illustrates its paucity of understanding about the human needs of unemployed people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government proposes to hand out at least $125 tax free in April to every family eligible for family allowance. One can only ask: why? A bribe? Trinkets for the natives? A spot of pork-barrelling? Tokenism of the worst kind? A somewhat bizarre one-off attempt to stimulate the economy? Or simply the biggest by-election campaign in history? It is really Paul Keating saying, `I'm sorry; here's $125 compensation for making your life a misery'. The money will be welcomed by most families, if somewhat cynically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This payment seems to be the one measure in the package designed to provide an instant kick-start to consumer spending. It comes wrapped up in the guise of a social justice measure, but it fails on both counts. Firstly, the additional $300m is a mere drop in the ocean of consumer spending. Further, many of these families will not use the payment to buy consumer goods. They will, despite the Government's exhortations, use it to pay off their very many debts which have accumulated during the recession&mdash;a recession brought on by Mr Keating himself and in some cases due to earning limitations on unemployment beneficiaries and pensioners. If they are able to afford to spend the payment, the risk is that the money will go on imported goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government is expecting the payment to stimulate the economy, it should therefore be urging families to use the payment only on the purchase of Australian goods. One way to ensure this would have been for the Government to develop the `100 per cent Aus' labelling scheme. Consumers could then actually make an informed choice about what they were buying, and Paul Keating should now be urging families to spend their one-off payment on 100 per cent Australian production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the payment really demonstrates very clearly this Government's inability to come to grips with the structural problems of poverty. Yes, families are assisted by the payment, but what about those single people or couples without children who are trying to live on low incomes? Where is the help for them? We welcome the increase in family allowance supplement, the boost in funding for welfare agencies and the reduction in rent assistance waiting periods. We have been calling for such measures for some time. The Government has listened with ears closed and eyes shut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are somewhat hollow gestures in the context of a package that accepts around 8 per cent unemployment for at least the next four years. With that long term prospect in mind, what does the package do by way of addressing the structural problems of poverty? The short answer is: absolutely nothing. Here was a chance to tackle some of those structural problems. For example, the Government could have increased the amount people on pensions and benefits are permitted to earn before losing their entitlement to payment. It could have reinstated young unemployed people's incomes back to the adult level. It could have reduced or removed all the existing waiting periods for income support, which are currently responsible for so much poverty in this country, particularly amongst families. But the Government has not gone for genuine social justice for the victims of this recession. Instead, it has gone for the easy option, the social justice gimmick, the money, not the structural box. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats welcome the $720m funding boost to the education and training sectors. We recognise this as a vital link between employment, education and training. But again, $720m is simply not enough. Over 100,000 applicants missed out on TAFE places this year. That is a tragedy both for them and for this nation. The Prime Minister has failed to develop a strategy to overcome this shortfall in future years. Commonwealth estimates of funding requirements for the TAFE sector indicate that between $2 billion and $2.5 billion in recurrent annual expenditure will be needed to meet the education participation goals of the Government by the year 2001. This is especially so if, by the year 2001, 95 per cent of all 19-year-olds are either in the work force or in higher education, as the Finn review recommends and the Democrats strongly hope will occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sum of $720m over the next three years is totally insufficient if the Government is to meet these goals, even if the allocation was clearly explained&mdash;which, in Mr Keating's statement, it is not. We urgently require a comprehensive plan that details recurrent and capital expenditure for TAFE over the decade and irons out the existing imbalance in funding arrangements. Equally, we need to know&mdash;and the Prime Minister is not telling us&mdash;how the Government plans to fund the infrastructure, staffing and capital works programs needed to cope with the increased university enrolment that Labor has been imposing on universities and promises to continue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The threat to the worker does not come only from unemployment or inadequate social security structures. The Government has buried among its sweeping statements of reform a potential threat to the public interest in the preparation of enterprise agreements. Yesterday Senator Bell asked a question of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) regarding the Government's intentions. These intentions are no clearer for Mr Keating's having gestured in their direction. The Labor Government has been promising large scale industrial reform for some time. The Democrats call on it to bring on the legislation so that we can see clearly just what the role of the Industrial Relations Commission is to be and what precise steps the Government will take to see that the public interest is met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating is to spend $1 billion on big projects, especially in the transport sector. We have long advocated this, although we have said that $2 billion in outlays was needed for that expenditure to be effective. Mr Keating has, to the extent of $1 billion, now confirmed our view. Senator Powell has already raised our concerns in this chamber, but because of the importance of this area I shall repeat some of them. This statement has been touted as a major boost to rail transport. An additional $454m will be provided to the National Rail Corporation to standardise and improve the national rail system. At first glance, this level of rail spending looks like a welcome boost to a vital element in our national infrastructure. But it must be remembered that, under Labor, investment in rail has been appallingly low and has been progressively run down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his statement, Mr Keating points out that the construction of a national rail highway `should have been done a hundred years ago'. That means it could have been done over the last nine years under a Labor government in which Mr Keating was the chief policy architect. The fact is that $454m over the next two years will compensate&mdash;and that is all&mdash;for the total neglect of rail by Labor. No evidence has been provided by this Government to demonstrate that the money it proposes to spend will result in a major shift of freight from road to rail. We are told that Melbourne to Sydney rail transit times will be 12 hours, a reduction of 1 1/2 hours. But a modern heavy truck can do the trip in 10 hours and can go direct to the final destination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be fascinated to know whether any cost-benefit studies have been done, predicting such things as the shift of freight and passengers from road to rail, the reduction in road deaths and the reduction in greenhouse gases due to greater fuel efficiency. If not, the Government has simply thrown public money at rail in the absence of a cohesive transport policy. If there are studies, the public and the Parliament deserve to see them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the transport initiatives in this statement appear to have been hastily cobbled together in the absence of a clear transport policy framework and without thorough cost-benefit assessments. It is difficult to know how far they will go to meeting the desirable long term objectives. If the Government begs to differ&mdash;and no doubt it will&mdash;then it needs to put some evidence on the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation package proposes a one-market policy for the airline industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats congratulate the Prime Minister for adopting the recommendation from the Australian Democrats' platform paper on transport to improve the international facilities at Brisbane and Melbourne airports. Improved facilities under the Democrats' program would help to disperse international activity to airports other than Sydney, thus eliminating the need for a third runway. But we are angry and concerned at the raw deal given to country air services in this package. Further deregulation may well mean greater competition and consumer choice on some main routes, but the Government is abdicating its fiscal responsibility to rural aerodromes and regional and rural users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government proposes to boost industry by accelerated rates of depreciation, changing tax rules and making investment in Australian industry more attractive. The emphasis is on big, durable investments. This is indeed a step in the right direction but, again, it does not go far enough. To regain our economic standing we must become innovative. We lag behind Japan and Germany, which are already innovation driven. It is truly a disaster for Australia that we are locked into a sort of time warp of the early 1900s, when all we had to do was dig it up or chop it down and ship it out. It was so easy. Overseas companies manufactured, created and invented. We simply bought our products from them&mdash;and we have not moved very far beyond that mentality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's package does little to alleviate this. It re-states that exporting raw materials and value-adding to them will continue to play a vital role. Despite the Government's stated belief that `Australia's well-being depends on the country having dynamic and internationally competitive industries', the Government's only contribution towards making Australia a leader in research and technology is to create the Australian Technology Group. But a one-off capital base of $30m to bid for the rights to publicly funded research projects and sell them to business is totally inadequate. We commend the Government for picking up on Australian Democrats' policy, but we believe this funding should have been at least doubled to stimulate R&amp;D promotion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats believe in preferential support for projects based on ecologically sustainable development, such as energy efficient products, solar energy and telecommunications.

Industry is crying out at the very least for a freezing of the planned tariff cuts to help tide it over until better times. Unless this is forthcoming, many industries will collapse beyond resuscitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's trade performance is the invisible factor in Mr Keating's statement. The Government is clearly content to rest on the laurels of exporters who have taken our products abroad with little or no help from the Government. Manufacturers, workers and farmers have been left to rot while the Government continues to cut tariffs, which will demolish what is left of the Australian manufacturing industry. Meanwhile, the Government is happy to pin its hopes on the Dunkel recommendations in the GATT round of negotiations&mdash;which are clearly destined to fail. A boost for Austrade is welcome news, but it is a woefully inadequate response to the urgent need to protect the remaining jobs in our manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To rural Australia, the Prime Minister brings a mixed message.

Can the Government please explain if this projected growth in the tourism industry is included in these overarching job figures, or has the Prime Minister simply `fiddled the sums'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are somewhat more sanguine about the Prime Minister's tax proposals. After all, most of the measures are either reversals of previous erroneous decisions or adaptations of Democrat policy. The major initiative is the new accelerated depreciation regime. The Government has abandoned the level playing field to a point and has skewed the tax system slightly towards productive investment. We have been calling for that for years. The Prime Minister is now claiming that `Australia now has a world competitive depreciation regime'. What he does not tell us is that up until 1988 we had an even more generous depreciation regime than the one announced last night. Mr Keating, as Treasurer, destroyed that regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the so-called development allowance is basically a less generous, more targeted investment allowance which was originally introduced by Prime Minister Fraser and axed by `Level Playing Field' Keating in 1985. Unfortunately, though, there are two tax decisions that reinforce the impression of the entire document that the Government does not understand ecologically sustainable development. The first is the sales tax reduction for new motor vehicle purchases. It is Democrat policy to tax cars on the basis of their fuel efficiency. The sales tax reduction should apply only to fuel efficient vehicles. This would reduce our consumption of and hence importation of oil and therefore our current account deficit. It would also reduce the smog which recently grounded about 10 per cent of Sydneysiders who suffer from asthma and other respiratory allergy disorders and were therefore advised to remain indoors on two successive particularly smoggy days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other alternatives. It could have taken up a suggestion which has been around for at least two decades and has been taken up by the Industry Commission. For instance, it could have reduced to near zero the fixed costs of car ownership, that is, registration and third party insurance, and replaced these charges with a levy on fuel. Such a strategy would have encouraged car ownership while discouraging car usage for non-essential trips. It would have also cost the Government nothing; it would have been revenue neutral. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Imagine the combination of this Government and the Opposition's proposals&mdash;a reduction in sales tax on cars; people buying more cars; a reduction of 18c per litre on fuel under Hewson; a further 15 per cent impost on public transport fares; and a reduction of expenditure on public transport under a Hewson government which would reduce government expenditure. That is a recipe for absolute disaster in the major capital cities such as Melbourne and Sydney. The overriding impression left by this statement is that the Government has completely missed the opportunity to reorient economic policy towards ecologically sustainable development. All Mr Keating is really doing is lending legitimacy to some resource industry plans to exploit protected areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, we note that the statement further weakens Commonwealth powers and, although it does not provide any details of arrangements with the States and Territories to protect the environment, there is clearly anticipated a watering down of those powers. Mr Keating's One Nation statement is simply a slick public relations exercise. There is the presentation as new initiatives projects which are already under way. There is expenditure of new money which is actually filched from old programs such as the MFP program taken from the better cities program. There is a danger of foreign takeover in the program. There is a complete lack of awareness of the future; there is no vision. Mr Keating is simply on the wrong track and in most of the statement he has pushed ahead on that wrong track. This program will lead to chaos, to poverty, to misery, to despair, to nowhere. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Government has failed to understand is that there is a real world out there full of suffering Australians&mdash;but Australians only too eager to drive in and get their country going again. The Government must recognise and address the real problems. Australians deserve a better deal than they are getting from this Government. Just look around Australia and see the devastation and struggle: farmers crippled by debt, by years of high interest rates imposed by this Government, by a trade and subsidies war that corrupts the markets for their products. While their competitors overproduce because of government protected prices and export subsidies, the world prices our farmers are expected to accept are lowered below the cost of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generations of labour are lost as farms are sold up, employment opportunities are forgone, and our efficient agricultural products are replaced in the domestic market by subsidised imports. Likewise, there are efficient manufacturing industries unable to compete and win contracts against imports. Factory owners are becoming their own factory hands in the fight to save their investments and in today's climate they are seeing their hard earned capital base disappear before their very eyes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this leads to one million unemployed with youth unemployment levels at 35.8 per cent. The idea of 800,000 new jobs over the next four years is a flight of fancy. In fact, the $20 billion rise in public debt over the next four years represents a cost to the taxpayer of $40,000 per job. Even on Mr Keating's rosy prediction, the unemployment rate will be 10 per cent in a year's time. It is Mr Keating's rosy vision that concerns me greatly. A growth rate of zero to 4.75 per cent when the rest of the world is in recession&mdash;higher than the major OECD countries&mdash;is a very rosy and brave prediction. His predictions have not been good in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was his 1988 Budget Speech prediction that Australia was now well on its way to prosperity. What have we got? His 1989 Budget Speech prediction was that `as a result of the Government's economic policies, Australia will emerge from the recent high level of spending without a recession and with its economic and social structure improving'. What a misrepresentation! His record on predictions leaves a lot to be desired. In fact, he does not have one right yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had droughts and economic downturns before, but this time it is different. The difference this time is that when the massive drought and economic downturn occurred in 1982 and 1983 we had a viable farming and manufacturing industry to fall back on. This time we are fast approaching having nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During 1983-84, agriculture grew at the rate of 45 per cent, and mining at 9.5 per cent. A good viable farming sector was the backbone of the 6 per cent growth after that recession. Real growth in 1983-84 would have been only 2 per cent or 3 per cent had agriculture and mining not recorded good growth. During the last time of drought and recession, the Liberal-National Party Government did not adopt a scorched earth policy like this Government. Its programs made sure that rural industries were not depleted, so that when the economy picked up, they were ready to fire&mdash;immediately earning export income, immediately contributing to Australia's economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, when one-third of all farmers are suffering negative incomes, when farm exports have plunged to a low of $1.4 billion, when 10 per cent of broadacre farmers have experienced two consecutive years of negative cash income, and average farm incomes are only two-thirds of the level of the 1982-83 drought, this Government will regret the neglect and anti-rural policies it has inflicted on rural Australia. As happened in the last recession, the economy cannot get going again without its power house&mdash;agriculture&mdash;as its impetus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problems attacking rural Australia must be addressed. This Government must not follow the recommendations of the Industry Commission to eliminate the tariffs for the sugar industry and the dairy industry. To cut tariffs without cutting input costs is to destroy the industry that could really lead to our economic recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US and the EC are continuing to increase their subsidies and lowering world prices. Our farmers have to compete on world markets distorted by annual subsidies of $385 billion. Of this, the EC provides $133 billion; the US, $74 billion; and Japan $59 billion. Just this year, the US Government increased its dairy export incentive scheme fivefold. The effect is to undercut world markets by 60 per cent. The EC also gives dairy subsidies at the level of 69 per cent. It is the same with wheat, with the US selling subsidised wheat into our traditional markets. Only one-third of all wheat production is freely traded in the entire world. Just this month our ally, the US, offered 200,000 tonnes of subsidised wheat to Yemen&mdash;our traditional market&mdash;on top of the 300,000 tonnes of subsidised wheat it has already sold there, taking over half of our market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the same with sugar where a 57 per cent subsidy is provided by the EC. The sugar industry is presently feeling the effects of major droughts and low world prices. It has to accept the corrupted world price of 8c a pound while its competitors in the US receive a guaranteed domestic price of 23c a pound and 15c a pound in Thailand. The sugar industry, for example, has a goal to increase production to five million tonnes by the turn of the century. It is an industry capable of lifting our much needed export earnings, but when it is the sugar producer most exposed to world prices and has just lost $350m from drought and corrupt world prices now is not the time to remove the small tariff levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the real attitude of the Government to Australia's farmers is seen by the $51m payment to the textile, footwear and clothing industry to assist adjustment, compared with the assistance given to farmers. Besides this, the rural sector is to receive only $10.8m next year and $6m for part B of the rural adjustment scheme for 75 interest subsidies to enable grain growers to plant crops&mdash;and cane growers too, I might add. This is a totally inadequate response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With 10 per cent of all broad acre farms with two consecutive years of negative cash income and our wheat crop down to 9.5 million tonnes, the industry called for underwriting for one season to give confidence to growers to plant a crop and to lenders to finance a crop. This has been totally rejected by the Government. A GMP could definitely provide a major turnaround for the national economy&mdash;surely it is just the type of scheme we should be considering. With current prices at a high of $180, government exposure would be minimal, but it would provide that boost, that confidence, to get Australian wheat farmers planting again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the US export enhancement program was introduced, Australian plantings have reduced by 40 per cent from 15 million tonnes to 9.5 million tonnes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A GMP would have ensured an immediate increase in plantings of 20 per cent. Twenty five per cent of Australian wheat farmers need assistance. This new scheme will help 10 per cent of them, leaving 15 per cent still in need. The sugar industry and Mr Bonanno will have to get in the queue. There are 7,000 wasted farmers who could be investing, employing and earning. At the moment, we are struggling to meet our long term contracts of 13 million tonnes. The buyers are there. With a GMP we would have a strong wheat industry underlying a real economic revival. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Plantings have to take place by early March in Queensland&mdash;two weeks away&mdash;and by late March in the southern States. But already, one day after the announcement, there are indications that the scheme will run into problems. To qualify for part B there have to be short term money problems. But for a bank to lend, a farmer has to be able to service the debt and repay the capital. When a farmer is eligible for part B, he is in a difficult position to get approval for a bank loan. An interest subsidy will not help when farmers are in desperate need of credit. Banks will need security before they will lend, plus a guaranteed ability for the farmer to pay back the debt. Already these farmers on part B are being assisted with interest payments to make them viable. The Government has to address this problem urgently&mdash;not just flick past it and leave it for State rural adjustment authorities to work out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the problem of how the scheme will get up and running in time for planting next month. It is of the utmost importance to achieve a decent wheat crop. I ask the Minister to give an assurance to the industry that the scheme will be fully operational so that no eligible farmer will miss out on planting times because of paperwork requirements. RAS is being used by the Government as its too hard basket for rural Australia. It is now a social welfare department, a financing organisation. It is now being asked to make assessments as to who will be picked out of the barrel for crop assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the scheme now stands, any farmer in part A cannot be considered for the new scheme; any farmer who is viable will not be considered; any farmer in part C will not be considered; and any farmers seeking Jobsearch will not be considered. This assistance package must not be allowed to miss the mark as the Jobsearch proposal has. It is shaping up just like that fiasco. The Jobsearch scheme announced last December was aimed at 2,000 farmers. In fact, many senators here tonight will remember Senator Richardson's statement. I ask the Democrats whether they remember that he told the Senate that he wanted it passed immediately so that the farmers would have it available `next Monday'. Do they remember that? Yet, since 1 December only 116 certificates for farmers' Jobsearch have been issued&mdash;116 is nowhere near the 2,000 farmers the Jobsearch allowance scheme was targeted at and they certainly did not get it the next Monday. Hopefully, farmers will have easier access to the one-off crop planting program. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic statement also announced changes to allow the wool stockpile debt to be repaid on a cumulative schedule rather than the fixed annual debt reduced target. At long last, the Government has answered the industry's plea to be allowed to manage its funds more effectively and reduce market speculation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The excesses of the stockpile earnings should be able to go back to benefit the industry now, when it needs it, by reducing the level of the 12 per cent tax and relieving the tax burdens on woolgrowers. All this puts more money into struggling rural economies. Farmers' payments provide great stimulus to rural towns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of our farm machine industry and other suppliers is at a critical level. Capital expenditure on new plant, machinery, buildings and infrastructure declined by 35 per cent in 1990-91 and is forecast to fall a further 8 per cent next year. The latest Outlook conference was told that Australia's agricultural implement manufacturing base has continued to shrink to the extent that in future machinery designed for unique Australian conditions may no longer be available. This is the state we are in. Our farms, our manufacturers are disappearing forever. When the recession does end, when the upturn does come, there will be very few industries left on which to base a recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite Mr Keating's plan, the only way to help the economy in a long term and sustained way is to boost export industries and import replacement industries. Yet a report from a New South Wales manufacturing survey yesterday revealed that one in eight New South Wales manufacturers were contemplating moving offshore, and one in 20 large New South Wales manufacturers had in fact moved offshore in the past two years. That is repeated in every other State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is something vitally wrong with Australia when, to survive, the only course available to its industries is to go offshore. The Government's trade policy leaves battered and bruised Australian industries with only one defence: anti-dumping. Yet take any recent anti-dumping case example&mdash;subsidised dumped tomatoes, peaches and pears, dumped peanuts: an action takes at least a year and sometimes longer. The whole process takes 195 days or 11 months to reach a decision, with the cost of a case averaging around $170,000 and able to go a lot higher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Imports are at such a high level that some canneries will not process one Australian tomato this year, and peach and pear processing will be reduced by 30 per cent. Our anti-dumping system is still not adequate. It must be quicker. It must have the strength to defer importers who are thumbing their noses at our system. Some industries are just too small to launch anti-dumping cases. The small navy bean industry of Queensland knows that baked beans are being dumped. In the pig meat industry, which has seen its market lost to highly subsidised Canadian imports, almost two million kilograms of Canadian pig meat have flooded our domestic market over the last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anti-dumping is the only defence against subsidised imports, then surely these smaller industries must have financial assistance to launch their cases or else be wiped out. As long as Australian industries do not operate on a level playing field because of highly subsidised competition or high costs, our anti-dumping laws must work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating may have broken the back of inflation, but in doing so he has broken the hearts of millions of Australians. Everyone wants Australian industries to reach international competitiveness, but to keep on increasing costs on employees is not the way to go. We are told by Mr Keating not to worry about wage increases, that he has reached a deal with the unions, that their claims will not increase past the inflation rate. But the increase in costs since the accord was introduced in 1983 for extras such as the training guarantee levy, structural efficiency levy, classification creep, shorter hours equalling 5 per cent&mdash;that is, a 38-hour week&mdash;has seen at least a 25 per cent increase in wages from 1983 to 1987, and they have increased considerably more since then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This package confirms that the Government is going ahead with legislated superannuation for small business&mdash;all extra costs that industries cannot afford to bear and beyond the capacity for them to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our quest for internationalisation must be seen from the angle of what it costs to employ labour in countries with comparable living standards. In Japan, an employee works 2,000 hours a year; in Australia, it is 1,700 or less. Japanese employees have no holiday leave loading whereas Australian employees have a 17 1/2 per cent loading. Japanese employees have no rostered days off whereas Australian employees enjoy them to the extent that our manufacturing industry is reaching the point where rostered days off amount to an extra 12 long weekends a year when those employers do not have access to their staff. In Australia it costs an employer 75c a minute to employ a worker. In New Zealand, just a short trip across the Tasman, an employee costs only 55c a minute, with New Zealand industry having a 40c exchange rate advantage on us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point has been reached in Australian industry where, with the increased cost of a 38-hour week, rostered days off every month, superannuation and training levy and increases in wages by accords and other adjustments, a 17 1/2 per cent loading, long service and sick leave, Australia has priced itself out of the market. The Government's policies have increased costs to Australian manufacturers, miners and farmers. While this Prime Minister and the previous Prime Minister have said that we must become internationally competitive, they have at the same time put these extra cost burdens on Australian farmers and manufacturers. They have undermined industry by increasing costs and then pulling the rug right out from underneath them by removing tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government wants it both ways. It wants its cake, it wants to eat its cake, and it even wants a picture on the wall of the cake. If the Government believes we can be internationally competitive by increasing costs, reducing working hours, adding training and superannuation levies to Australian business, farmers and miners, then it has only to see the results: the kids who cannot get jobs; the increased bankruptcies from collapsed businesses; the farmers who have been forced off their farms; and the unemployed searching for jobs which have been exported overseas to disappear forever. This is the living proof of this Government's failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This recession which our present Prime Minister said we had to have has seen dreams dashed and equity built up over generations destroyed and gone forever. This package will not fool the people out there who know what life is like outside the thick walls of this parliamentary building. This package is a political package for the survival of Mr Keating and his Government. It may have jogged the memory of the Government, but it will not fool the people who remember that rail spending on the election of the Hawke Government, plunging from $65m to $11m and reaching nothing for the years 1988 till yesterday.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is very good for Australian politics, and perhaps the Australian people are being better served than they have been in recent years, that there are now before the Australian people two major economic packages&mdash;alternative plans for the future of Australia; alternative views about the way the country should best develop economically; alternative views about economic, social and, to some extent, cultural values and policies. I think that is for the good; that is the way Australian politics should be conducted at that level of debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That those two packages are now before the people 12 months before the next election is a plus. It is a plus because it gives to the Australian people the opportunity to compare and contrast, to make over the period an informed judgment about their preferences. That is the way the democratic system should work. It is why we have the Westminster system, which requires political parties aspiring to government to put forward economic programs that cover the broad spectrum of policy issues and makes informed judgment possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this process is not helped when we find people endeavouring to make wildly exaggerated criticisms of economic packages. I have not wasted a lot of my time, which could otherwise have been better spent in watching the cricket&mdash;and I regret to say that England will win&mdash;but I did spend a minute or two watching Dr Hewson's response to the economic package. He said that no credible spokesperson has had a favourable interpretation of the Keating economic package. That could mean only that the definition of `credible' is people who agree with Dr Hewson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went to my office and picked up the first two documents in front of me. Disregarding the Labor Party and, just to make people here happy, disregarding all the trade union people who came out and supported the package, and of course there are many of those, I decided I would look at the comments of a few international and Australian commentators, none of whom, as far as I know, are card-carrying members of the Labor Party and all of whom can be properly defined as credible. We have on the AAP wire from Washington:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">US financial analysts today welcomed Prime Minister Paul Keating's recovery plan as the right short-term medicine for Australia's ailing economy.</PARA>
<PARA>The economist David Hale, of Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, who I think is broadly accepted as one of the better international analysts of the Australian economy, said amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;the supply side spending on infrastructure and things designed to enhance export competitiveness is the correct policy for a country still in a severe recession.</PARA>
<PARA>So that we do not fall for the trap of thinking that what is happening in Australia is something rare and unique that other responsible governments would not be doing, he went on to say that the package is `consistent with recent policy developments in the US and Europe', which is correct. Merrill Lynch's analyst, Douglas Johnson, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the statement should help to break the psychology of the recession by providing a boost to business and consumer confidence.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that the recovery package was a plus for the equity market. I suppose Dr Hewson might not think that Merrill Lynch and Kemper Financial Services in the United States are credible economic spokespersons. I do not know what he thinks about John Elliott, but the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dateline News Digest</EMPHASIS> quotes former Liberal Party President John Elliott backing Prime Minister Paul Keating's economic statement. It quotes the ANZ chief, Will Bailey, as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The stimulus to the economy announced in the Government's economic statement last night was a sound move.</PARA>
<PARA>It quotes the BHP Managing Director, John Prescott, as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry would be encouraged to invest by measures announced in the Government's economic statement.</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose none of those constitute credible economic commentators because they do not agree with Dr Hewson. But by any objective measure it is a very comprehensive range of endorsements, and there are plenty more, as people would know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do we have this comparison and contrast? It is because, now that the alternative package has been brought down, it is becoming clear, and the opinion polls have made it clear since the discussion about it has emerged, that the fascination with the Fightback package is receding. It used to be the only show in town and it was therefore getting some support because the Australian people said, `We might not like it but it is the only proposal about'. That is no longer the case, and they are starting to wake up to it. That is why the opinion polls show that support for Dr Hewson has been falling rapidly since the middle of January. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people understand. They have a long time to make a final judgment, but it is very dangerous to underestimate them. They understand some of the key criteria. So let us have a look at the comparisons between these two documents&mdash;just a preliminary one, because there is a long time to go. There is a year's worth of analysis to go. We will have this debate another 364 times, I suspect, between now and then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the jobs proposal. It is very easy to see where the jobs will come from in the One Nation package. One does not need any smoke and mirrors. One does not need a big distortion to put in an economic analysis saying, `If you had this program it would create two million jobs. Put it in your package and hope that people will not notice that the package that is being analysed is not the Fightback package. The big job scenario is based on some different package. It does not even include the goods and services tax'.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the Fightback package one asks where the jobs are. I can see where lots of people will get sacked. I can see where lots of jobs will disappear. I cannot see where any jobs will be created. As Ralph Willis, the Minister for Finance, said in the House of Representatives tonight, it is an incredible hoax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 800,000 jobs on offer over four years. We would be delighted to be able to say there will be more. One would like to be able to say that the rate of economic growth could be higher and that therefore unemployment would fall more quickly. But it is an achievable, responsible goal against the Fightback package, which claims, with some smoke and mirrors, that with a bit of luck a lot of jobs will be created. In the middle of a recession, what it is proposing is to tighten fiscal policy by between $1.7 billion and $3 billion in the first year. First year high school economics would tell us that doing that in the middle of a recession would lose a lot of people their jobs, and there are a whole lot of other proposals in the package to sack people. So on the jobs front the alternative is very stark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the tax front, it is as stark as it can be because of the goods and services tax&mdash;the ideologically driven commitment to change the tax mix from income to consumption. There is a lot of sophisticated capacity to analyse the implications of the tax policy, but just look at it by this one criterion: if people consume 100 per cent or more of their income&mdash;and many people are forced to consume more than 100 per cent&mdash;they pay the GST on the whole 100 per cent of that income. If other people are wealthy enough not to have to spend all their income, if they can save 20 per cent, 30 per cent, 40 per cent, they have to pay the GST only on what they spend and they get tax cuts to help them enjoy the fruits of their higher income. They also get bigger tax cuts than the people down the bottom, who pay the GST on every cent they spend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GST is a very indiscriminate tax. It taxes the necessities. It taxes the food and clothing. It taxes the necessities at the same rate as the luxuries. In a comparison between the two documents, we should look at the priorities. The cars that will be more expensive if the GST comes in are the cars that ordinary Australians buy&mdash;the Holden Commodores, the little Barinas, all those sorts of things. But the Ferraris, the Maseratis and the Rolls Royces will be cheaper and the people who buy them will have the biggest tax cuts to pay for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GST is an indiscriminate and unfair tax. The money will not be used to fund the tax cuts to the poor to compensate them. That will be funded by expenditure cuts, the significance of which I will come to in a moment. The alternative package, the One Nation package, is able to deliver the 30c rate to Australian workers without the strings of a 15 per cent GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That points up one of the other areas of contrast. We have a big contrast in jobs. We have a big contrast in tax. There is a big contrast in prices and inflation. The One Nation package is able to supply growth with low inflation, particularly because of wages policy, and I will come to that in a moment, but also because it does not give that massive one-off surge to prices that the GST does. All the modellers, even the supporters of the GST, are saying that if one does not have a wages policy one cannot get that one-off surge out of the system. It is possible in the economic textbook for it to be a one-off surge, but only if one can get a wages policy to get it out of the system, and there is no wages policy in this statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth area of major contrast is in wages policy. There is absolutely no wages policy. What does that mean? Combine that with the GST, and it means one gets the surge in inflation. There is no way of getting it out of the system and no fiscal policy capacity to do it because the Opposition has its fiscal policy locked in. The only vehicle the Opposition has left is higher interest rates, and that means interest rates will go up. The economy, already tightened by $1.7 billion to $3 billion worth of cuts in expenditure, will tighten even further as we get the impact of the higher interest rates trying to squeeze the inflation out of the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then get the emotional argument&mdash;whoever wrote Senator Boswell's speech was making the same point&mdash;that this is somehow terrible because it is what is called an unfunded increase and because in 1992-93 we will have a projected 1.9 per cent of GDP as a deficit. I will come back to that in a moment. Australian public sector debt is very low. It is very easy to play the distorting game and say that Australia has a massive debt. Australia's public sector debt is one of the lowest in the OECD. It remains very low and modest even under this package. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short should read the speech of the Minister for Finance. Mr Willis pointed out that even under the worst predictions&mdash;which I think were absolutely wrong&mdash;that Dr Hewson made tonight in the House of Representatives about what would happen to overseas debt under our package, the position is not as bad as the scenarios of what will happen under the Opposition's Fightback package. I think the Opposition is exaggerating what will happen under ours. But even at the most pessimistic, that is not as bad as the overseas debt predictions in the Opposition's package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk mainly about public sector debt because that is what this debate is about. How will this be funded? It will be funded in the same way as other deficits that Australian governments have run up in 26 of the last 30 years were funded. It may have escaped the notice of Senator Short and his colleagues that only one government in Australian history has ever delivered a surplus and that was this Labor Government. There was a surplus for four years. In every other year there was a deficit and we funded it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The projection for the five years from 1991-92 to 1995-96 is for an average deficit of 0.88 of one per cent of GDP. I can compare that average. The highest projection is for 1992-93. I think it is a pretty accurate projection; it is not far out. The projection is that it might be 1.9 per cent of GDP. Even that is less than the deficit as a percentage of GDP in 15 of the last 40 years in Australian history. It is less than it was in five of the eight years of the Fraser Government in which the deficit as a percentage of GDP averaged 2.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How was that funded? It was funded in the same way that every country around the world funds deficits in a recession. It is approximately the average deficit as a percentage of GDP of the 30 years before 1983. The average would be even less if one took the Labor Government's record of running some surpluses into it. But the average of the 30 years before the Labor Government came into power is approximately what is projected for the next five years. So let us not get in a panic about how we will fund this very modest deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry that Senator Short has left&mdash;I do not want to speak about him while he is not here. I only want to refer to a question he put today. He asked, `Will not this borrowing to fund the deficit push up interest rates?'. Does anybody seriously think that the problem in the Australian economy is an excess of demand for money; that there are too many people out there wanting to borrow to invest; that there is too much demand? I really do not think that is the problem we are confronting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nor is there an excess of demand for other resources. I wish there were an excess of demand for labour; it would be great. We would not have the One Nation package then. What we would be doing probably would be inflationary. That is why we did not do it when there was an excess of demand. That is why in the good years we cut back. We went into surplus so that when the difficult times came we had the capacity to spend and still remain within the normal standard parameters of the fiscal policies pursued by Australian governments over the last 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Great concern has been expressed that we are going to spend all this money on roads and railways. Nobody says that that is a bad thing; they are just worried about whether we should be doing it now and so quickly. There will never be a better time to invest in road and rail than now. We will never get the construction projects undertaken more cheaply than now because the resources that are required to carry out those constructions are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Idle resources will be put to use. There are contractors out there with machinery just waiting to start. We are not out there competing with a busy private sector. If we do not do it this year or next year, when will we do it&mdash;in 1994-95 or 1995-96 when the economy has picked up and those resources are already fully utilised? Then we would be putting too much demand on the system; it then would be inflationary. When tenders were called, we would find that the tenders would be a lot higher. People would not be out there saying, `I will put in low tender to get the work'; they would be saying, `I am working flat out now. I will only do this job if I get an extra margin'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any sensible investor, public or private, who has the cash to undertake an investment now or who has the capacity to borrow now, invest cheaply and efficiently at the bottom of a recession and get the benefits when the pick-up comes, would do so. I should add to that the fact that this discharges the macro-economic responsibility of any responsible government. Put aside the very reasonable social concerns that this will provide jobs for people. Just talk about it as the macro-economic responsibility of a government to say, `In a recession it is our responsibility to try to maximise the level of growth to get the economy back on a growth path, to give it a stimulus'. That is what every country around the world is doing except those few dominated by the sterile accounting and ideological fixation that also dogs this Opposition at the moment. The United Kingdom and Canada, which have conservative governments, are in even worse recessions than Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although there is, entirely appropriately, a major public sector stimulus at this time, the principal stimulus in this economy is with the private sector through a broad range of measures. The private sector has said in the quotes that I have just read, `We will get the economy going, we will encourage investment and we will create jobs'. The depreciation changes will create jobs. They will get new equipment into Australian factories so that we can be more efficient and more competitive and get our manufactured exports growing even more quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be special increased assistance for tourism. That industry, which has been growing so effectively, needs another spurt of growth so that new projects can come on stream. Members of the Australian Tourist Industry Association told me that the change they most wanted was that the write-off rate for tourist buildings should be increased from 2 1/2 per cent to 4 per cent. That is exactly what is in this package. That is exactly what will encourage the investment in those tourism projects that can create hundreds of thousands of jobs and position us to meet the requirements of the growing number of tourists that we much need to come here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly support the changes that are being made in respect of offshore banking units.

We are now saying, `Come to Australia; we want you to create jobs here'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can remember when Neville Wran first proposed this. People were surprised because it sounds like something that creates jobs for only an elite few&mdash;perhaps for an elite few who come in from overseas. But when one thinks about it, those offshore banking units will take up office space in Sydney, Melbourne or whichever city they base themselves. There will be support workers, cleaners, couriers, drivers&mdash;all the support jobs that Australians need as well as the high quality professional jobs in the banking industry itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major tax change, which has been so welcomed by the motor industry, will not only create jobs and investment but also will result in cheaper passenger motor vehicles for Australians&mdash;cheaper cars that will become more expensive if the Opposition gains government. The only cars that will become cheaper under the coalition will be luxury cars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are special tax benefits for small businesses. We will not bog them down in the red tape of the GST; we will say, `You get 50 per cent of your goodwill on the sale of a business as an offset and we will defer the next income tax instalment to assist you'. Special pooled development funds will provide equity capital for small business and enhanced programs which will provide export assistance. They are the key elements. When he was a committee chairman, David Beddall was told by representatives from small business that this is what they wanted to maximise the potential for small business to contribute to the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the incentives for the banks&mdash;and the other reforms to the financial sector which I do not have time to talk about&mdash;to encourage them not to foreclose on businesses but to keep viable businesses running. Already I can see examples of where this might be of particular benefit&mdash;to ailing but long term beneficial businesses here in Canberra, and it will be the same all around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the most significant private sector incentive in terms of a major change that could, if it were successful, drive major investment and create many jobs is what I call the development bonds, the bonds to encourage the private sector to invest in infrastructure: in land transport, ports and electricity. These will be very important. They have the potential to be very important. There is still a need finally to deliver on that. One cannot claim in advance that something is going to be fantastic, but this incentive has the potential to make a significant improvement. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating, but I remain optimistic and, of course, there is the very significant new development allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have the public sector stimulus and the private sector stimulus. We can see in the One Nation package the tangible evidence of where the jobs are going to come from, against the alternative, which is a wish list and smoke and mirrors. The only thing which the Fightback package says in concrete terms about jobs is who will be sacked. It does not say anything about who will be employed. It just puts in a misleading document which purports to be a measurement of Fightback but which actually measures something quite different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are more things I would like to talk about, but let me refer to only two in the time available&mdash;two significant contrasts between these packages. The first relates to the environmental irresponsibility of the Fightback package. I did not hear much of Senator Coulter's contribution, as with Dr Hewson; I thought that I owed it to Australia to watch the cricket. But I did spend enough time listening to pick up the fact that he was expressing serious concern about some of the environmental elements of Fightback&mdash;the environmental consequences of the grubby little populist trick of cutting the price of petrol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know how any representative of New South Wales, having seen the report about the pollution problems in Sydney which the Greiner Government tried so hard to suppress&mdash;I suppose to serve the interests of Dr Hewson&mdash;could seriously propose such a policy. I am a critic of many things with Mr Greiner, but to his great credit he had the nerve to deliver some things that needed to be done. He put a levy on petrol. He did not do it for environmental reasons, but it actually was not a bad policy. He might have come to it back to front, he might not exactly have done with the money what I would have done, but at least he had the nerve to do the right thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This grubby bit of populism, this sell-out to the National Party, is environmentally grossly irresponsible. That is the starkest example of a leap back to the policy of the 1950s, the mentality that in some way or other we might buy some votes, that it worked for Bob Menzies in 1949 so we might give it another go. The spirit of Bob Menzies is stalking. It is not only his foreign policy and his policy towards Britain that the coalition is talking about; it now wants his petrol policy as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will also be putting up the price of solar panels and recycled paper&mdash;those areas where the wholesale sales tax has the capacity to discriminate environmentally.

For those and a variety of other reasons it is an environmentally irresponsible package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that has been significantly underestimated about the contrast between the Fightback package and the One Nation package is the social justice consequences of the massive expenditure cuts that are there to fund the tax cuts. The GST is frittered away on things like the cheap grab on the petrol prices. The coalition funds the tax cuts by massive expenditure cuts and tries to pretend that it is concerned about the poor, the underprivileged and those in need, when everybody has always known that the most significant redistributive function of government is not how it raises its money but how it spends its money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At last it has been proved. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has brought out data about the social consequences of government spending.

<PARA>No wonder the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> was running that cartoon depicting the Fightback package with the hole in it. People are starting to see through it.

That is why I am confident that the Australian people will choose the One Nation package when they are given the chance. </PARA>

<PARA>That is certainly what he has done. The bottom line is that he has gone for broke, and in the course of it he has sounded the death knell for himself and for his Government. As was said by my leader, Dr Hewson, Mr Keating had the chance last night but blew it totally. </PARA>

It is not an economic document. It is, as Michelle Grattan said today, `An unashamedly political pitch for votes'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the statement has received a mixed bag of responses in the media and elsewhere, but what comes through the comments that have been made is an overwhelming concern for the underlying structure of what the Government has put forward.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you believed just half of what was said last night, Moses would have to stand aside in utter embarrassment for our Paul to lead us to the promised land.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a pretty good description of the unbelievability of the proposals that have been put before us. This statement will stand or fall on whether it has any more credibility than the credibility that the new Prime Minister has. He was Treasurer for eight years, the architect and implementer of the greatest recession we have seen in 60 years. This was the Treasurer who boasted that he pulled the levers of economic policy. Well, he sure pulled them and with them pulled 1.5 million Australians out of work or caused them to be under-employed, and he pulled millions of others into a recession that he deliberately engineered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has no credibility at all. Last night's statement suffers the same fate as its author, the Prime Minister. It has no credibility either. Australians should never forget the track record of Prime Minister Keating when he was Treasurer and the number of times he misled the Australian community with statements which were obviously at variance with the facts and with the real economic situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The literature is replete with them. One would not want to waste the time of the Senate by going through them all, but some need repeating and repeating and repeating. There is an attempt going on by the Government and the Prime Minister to rewrite the economic history of the past eight years. The Opposition will never allow this Prime Minister and his Government to get away with it. Just four days before he made his first attempt at the political assassination of the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, at the end of May 1991, the former Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The economy is now moving into the recovery phase of the cycle.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that a few months after he had also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The worst is now behind us. The Government established the strategy to deal with the current account deficit and inflation and has stuck to it and is succeeding. . . We are, I think, starting to recover and the prospects for growth are promising and we will see in time whether we think we can say then at some time point hence that we are out of the recession&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Whatever that meant. In August 1990, just before the peak of the recession started to hit, Mr Keating said in his Budget Speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This year inflation will fall further&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Well, he was right on that. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the current account deficit will markedly improve and employment will pick up. In short, the kind of outcome the Government was seeking, delivered without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage recession.</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder what the 300,000 Australians who lost their jobs in the following 12 months thought about that. I wonder what the many thousands more Australians who suffered hardships in so many other ways felt about it. I wonder what they thought when at the same time in that Budget Speech Mr Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are definitely the golden years of change. Of course they are the golden years of change.</PARA>
<PARA>They were certainly years of change but they were years of very cruel disaster for most Australians. The Prime Minister has a fundamental credibility problem which extends par excellence into the One Nation document that he presented last night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say that there are not some good points in the document, because certainly there are. The coalition has welcomed the accelerated depreciation provisions, or at least the principle of them. We have welcomed the opening of the aviation market and the development of the aviation policy. We have welcomed the one-stop development approvals. We have welcomed the national power grid. We have welcomed the changes to capital gains tax. All those are announcements that the Prime Minister has taken straight out of the policies of the coalition's Fightback proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other aspects of last night's statement that I certainly welcome as well. Again they reflect in important measure the spirit and content of the coalition's Fightback proposals. The proposals relating to foreign banks are to be welcomed; the relaxation in the foreign investment rules are also to be welcomed. There are some good points in the statement. But they are, if anything, at the edges of the core of the statement. It is when one looks at the core of the statement that one finds its basic problems, faults and deficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essence of the problem with last night's statement is that the Government has gone on a very major spending binge, particularly in the area of infrastructure spending, without taking one offsetting decision which would enable the increased spending to be funded. As a result we shall face, according to the Government's figures, a situation where over the next four years, including 1991-92, we shall see a cumulative Budget deficit of $20 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked Senator Button at Question Time today how that $20 billion would be funded. Senator Button was unable to answer that question. He did not know, for example, that there is not one word or line in last night's statement to explain how it would be funded. Senator Button did not explain it. Senator McMullan did not explain it adequately tonight. The only way it can be funded is by government borrowing, either overseas or domestically or a combination of both, or by going to the Reserve Bank of Australia and cranking up the printing presses. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is where we come to some very interesting points. I will deal with two of those points. Firstly, in actual volume terms, it is a huge amount of money. The Government will have to raise that money on the domestic or overseas markets. Presumably, it will aim mainly to raise it on the domestic market because of its rightful concern about an even bigger blowing out of the foreign debt than will occur anyway. I will come back to that later. However, assuming that the Government aims basically to raise it on the domestic markets, that loan raising and drawing on the national savings will occur at a time when, assuming there is a recovery in the economy, as there will be at some stage&mdash;all economies recover; even the Australian economy will recover, at least in part, from the bludgeoning that this Government has subjected it to in recent years&mdash;the private sector as well will be seeking funds as part of the recovery process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Government seems to have completely overlooked is that already there is a very significant stimulus moving through the economy as a result of the interest rate cuts of the last year or so. Because of the lagged effects, those cuts have still to make an impact. Also, there has already been an enormous stimulus given through the unprecedented deterioration in the Government's budgetary position over the last two years. We have moved from a situation in 1989-90 when the Government had a Budget surplus of $8 billion to a situation this year, just two years later, where, even on the Government's own reckoning, the deficit will be $6.8 billion&mdash;say, $7 billion. That represents a turnaround in those two years of $15 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one really believes that that $6.8 billion will be achieved. It is more likely to be a deficit of something approaching $9 billion. To come in during the next five months&mdash;the figures are as yet unknown&mdash;with a deficit of $6.8 billion will require between the first half of 1991-92 and the second half a turnaround of an amount that is absolutely unprecedented in Australia's history. We have a deficit in the first six months of this year of $11 billion. To achieve a deficit of $7 billion means that there has to be a surplus of $4 billion in the second half of this year. That makes a turnaround between the first and second halves of the financial year of $15 billion. That has never before been achieved in our history. It could be achieved only if there were a major increase in economic activity in the second half of 1991-92&mdash;that is, between now and the end of June. Even the Government acknowledges that that will not happen and that we are still in a very recessed condition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budgetary stimulus that is in the economy is very great indeed. What the Government is doing with the package that it announced last night&mdash;this unfunded package, this absolutely, totally irresponsible spending package&mdash;is to compound that deficit situation in a way that will put enormous pressure on the financial markets. The bond market moved up today as the analysts started to look at the impact of the package. I am certain that on further inspection that market rate will increase. So we are now facing again a situation of inevitable and inexorable rises in interest rates. The last thing that the private sector in this country needs, if we are to attempt to get any recovery, is yet another increase in interest rates to the crippling levels that brought this country to its knees over the last couple of years. The impact of the deficit will be very considerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan before he left the chamber said, `Oh, well, it wasn't really all that big a problem because it was only a small percentage of GDP'. The forecasts in last night's statement are not really forecasts, as the Government itself admits in the fine print in this document. The so-called forecasts for the next four or five years are only scenarios. As the document makes clear, they are not forecasts as such, yet the whole of the figuring of the Budget has been predicated on the basis that they are forecasts. That is a fundamental flaw in the whole conceptual calculation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other enormous difference between the statement of last night and the coalition's Fightback proposals is that every ounce of increased revenue that the Government is relying on to fund its spending binge over the next four years is based on a very rapid rate of economic growth. The Fightback proposals that the coalition put forward were absolutely self-financed without any allowance at all for an incentive effect as a result of increased economic growth, which would obviously occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whereas the Fightback proposals are costed on the most conservative possible basis, the Government's statement last night and all its calculations are based on the most ambitious and least conservative result that could be achieved. There only has to be a hiccup in the growth forecasts on which last night's figures are based and there will be an enormously greater Budget deficit than the one forecast. For example, the predictions in the economic statement last night were based on a growth in the economy of something over 4 per cent on average over the next four years. That is a very optimistic scenario. If the growth rate falls below 4 per cent the $20 billion cumulative deficit over the next four years will absolutely skyrocket. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some modelling has been done today by the coalition using the Murphy model, which I think is accepted by both sides of politics as a very accurate econometric model. The results show that the Prime Minister's One Nation package will cause a major blow out in foreign debt. It will boost inflation significantly. It will cause a massive increase in the current account deficit. The Budget will remain in significant deficit through the whole of the four-year period&mdash;not just in a cyclical way but in a way that will produce a very significant structural deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the modelling we have done today, growth in gross domestic product will be much lower than the Government's suggested figure of 4 per cent to 4.3 per cent. In fact, the figure will average 3 per cent a year. Inflation, far from the Government's 3 3/4 per cent claim by the Prime Minister last night will, on the basis of the modelling done today, blow out to 6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current account deficit will increase to over $27 billion and net foreign debt will increase by about $100 billion. The results of that modelling are very clear. They indicate what really was clear last night but has become even clearer today and, that is, that the Keating so-called economic statement&mdash;as I said earlier, it should have been called a political statement&mdash;will cause massive structural damage to Australia's economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great con job has been attempted by the Government in the last 24 hours in the area of its supposed personal income tax cuts for Australians. The Government was claiming that average taxpayers would get an income tax cut of $46 a week in 1994 and 1996. That is palpably wrong. Firstly, on the Government's own admission in the statement last night, there will be no tax cut at all for persons earning less than $20,700 per year, and 42 per cent of all Australian income tax payers earn less than $20,700 a year. Almost half of the taxpaying population of Australia will not get one crack at tax cuts out of this package. Even those who will get tax cuts will have to wait until 1994 for the first cut and 1996 for the second cut to get anything out of it at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Someone on average weekly earnings, which is now the equivalent of $30,000 per year, will get a tax cut of around $14 per week. Those on $50,000 per year and above will get a $47 per week tax cut. Sure, there is a $46 a week tax cut for some people but it is for those people earning $50,000 and above per year, not the average earners as the Prime Minister has so dishonestly tried to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In stark contrast, the coalition's Fightback proposals not only offer tax cuts to all categories of income earners but they also allow for large increases in social security payments, increases which far outweigh the one-off price effect of about 4.4 per cent that will result from the introduction of the coalition's goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only are we giving the tax cuts and not only are we giving a very generous increase in social security benefits, but on top of all of that we will abolish sales tax, we will abolish petrol tax, we will abolish payroll tax, we will abolish the training guarantee levy, we will abolish the lump sum superannuation tax and we will abolish the coal export levy. All of those things add up to about $20 billion. That $20 billion is now paid by business simply on the cost of doing business in this country. It is not a tax on the profit that business earns; it is a tax that slugs business while it is trying to produce goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we want to get this country moving, we have to lessen that crippling burden that we have imposed on our business sector. That is the only way to make our country competitive. That is the only way that we can boost our exports and enable our local producers to compete against imports. There was not one jot in the economic statement last night that will make Australia a more internationally competitive economy. That was the whole thrust of the comments of my leader, Senator Hill, in his very valuable contribution to this debate tonight. Not one cracker of last night's economic statement will make Australia a more competitive nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic statement will add to our rate of inflation. It will not do it overnight, but it will do it very soon thereafter. It will add to the interest rate burden that consumers and producers alike face; it will not remove anything from the tax burden of businesses actually doing business in this country; and it will exclude 42 per cent of taxpayers&mdash;the lower end of the income tax scale, those people in our community who have been most hurt by the Government's crass, incompetent economic policies. They will not get one iota of benefit out of this package over the next five years. Because of the increase in inflation and the increase in interest rates, they are all going to be worse off. As Senator McMullan said, we have a very clear contrast and a stark choice for Australians to make over the next few months, pending the forthcoming election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other significant omissions from last night's economic statement. One of the most important reforms that this country needs and one which to his credit the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, was working towards, is a major reform of Commonwealth-State relations&mdash;particularly, Commonwealth-State financial relations. This Prime Minister is the centralist par excellence. He has knocked that proposal on the head. He has said nothing about Commonwealth-State financial relations, despite the fact that reform of Commonwealth-State financial relations is arguably the most important micro-economic reform that this country requires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night's statement by the Government fails on virtually every count. It fails on the confidence test. The Government has tried to buy confidence. You cannot buy confidence. The only way that governments can get confidence back into the community is by earning it through performance and sound, responsible economic policies. The Government has absolutely abrogated from that. It has failed the vision test. The one thing that the Prime Minister was going to be judged on last night was whether he had a vision for the future. Where was he going to lead Australia? Where does he want Australia to go? How is he going to get there? There was nothing about that in last night's statement. He absolutely failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the Prime Minister made a very great mistake, personally, when he pinned his colours to the mast in placing so much weight before the event on the significance of last night's economic statement. He will live to rue the day he did that because last night's statement was a disaster and it will be seen as a disaster for this Government when the election comes around.

The sort of extravagant rhetoric that we have had from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is part and parcel&mdash;indeed, stock in trade&mdash;of the way in which he has conducted himself on economic issues. I have no doubt that in the days to come the analysts, the economists and the commentators will do the arithmetic and will come to only one conclusion, which is inevitable: that this package is simply unsustainable. It is built on sands that simply do not exist. Indeed, it is the height of irresponsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one tries to think of the most important single line that goes through Australian politics in terms of economic responsibility, it is: where is the money coming from? It has almost in itself been enough to bring down governments in the past. When one tries to judge these things objectively, it is right that it should because it is the height of irresponsibility to make promises to spend money that is not ours, to hock the country in the future and to, in effect, mortgage one's grandchildren. This is precisely what we have before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A public debt that will rise by $20 billion over the next four years is an horrific sight to contemplate, given the enormity of our foreign debt and all the economic indicators that are weighted so heavily against us already. I do not think anyone can express it better than did Max Walsh today. I noticed Senator Button's churlish response. In one breath he said, `Of course, I don't want to put Max Walsh down; he is really quite an intelligent fellow, but he is a bit of a manic depressive basically'. At the same time, he was careful not to decry Max Walsh's economics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we can take it that even Senator Button is embarrassed to have to defend the package in the way that he tried to do today. It was painfully clear from his answers to several questions, one from Senator Short, that he was embarrassed in the extreme. He did not know some of the fundamentals of the document, and quite clearly was intellectually uncomfortable in defending the indefensible. What Max Walsh says, for example, when talking about this as a crude and dangerous political pork-barrelling exercise, is that Mr Keating has gone on a spending spree. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The magnitude of Mr Keating's gamble . . . is best illustrated by the treatment of public saving.</PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to demonstrate that the public sector borrowing requirement is indeed much higher than the Government would claim and is destined to go even higher in the very near future because of the blow-out of State deficits. What really is the ultimate in magic puddings is the statement that the Government will halve that borrowing requirement simply by restoration of the Commonwealth Budget balance, relying on restraint in outlays which decline as a proportion of GDP from 1992-93, partly offset by a decline in revenue as a proportion of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is economic gobbledegook. It is simply another way of saying that the Government refuses to give the slightest commitment to expenditure cuts. At the same time, it will not raise taxes. Indeed, we are in the process of having bribes thrown at us, on a deferred basis. At the end of the day it is simply a means of pretending that somehow the Government will be able to achieve savings when it has given not the slightest indication of how it hopes to do so. There is no doubt at all that the Government can finance these sorts of spending sprees only by borrowings; yet, just to quote another one of Mr Keating's immortal lines from only two years ago:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In three years there will be no government debt, domestic or external. It is an enormous claim that I can make on behalf of the Government of Australia. I doubt there is any other OECD economy that will not have any bonds on issue at all.</PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Short said, bond rates have already moved upwards today in anticipation of the inevitable, and it is quite clear that, if the Government is not going to embark on expenditure cuts or taxation increases, there are only two other options: one is simply to print money, which has drastic inflationary consequences; the other is to borrow, and that will indirectly force up interest rates and presumably exacerbate inflation in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is no semblance of responsibility in all this. Mr Keating has reached new heights of bombast which I suspect even Mr Hawke could not have achieved with a straight face. It really defies common sense when we look at some of the statements he has made in the past, such as `We are leading the world, as usual'; `redesigning capitalism'; `If we get the economy right then the security we give our people will really be quite profound by an international comparison'. Probably one of the most telling is a statement of about 18 months ago:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no prospect of massive increases in public spending&mdash;full stop. If you're savings poor you can't have it&mdash;like the people who say we've got to have a super highway from here to there. People here believe they can have brand new roads, buildings, brand new everything. Well, they can't.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course they cannot. He knew it then and he knows it now. But he has the gall to get up and somehow pretend that you can have all these things&mdash;in the hope, of course, that he will be taken at his word. We will not have anything to see for this prior to the next election. We will have some promises about all sorts of things down the track, but the political strategy is clear: simply to muddy the waters, pretend that things are happening, and make extravagant promises about the future to disguise the fact that unemployment will still stay around 10 per cent. Again, of course, the Government simply chooses to pretend that it will be below the magic 10 per cent figure. Somehow that is even more excruciatingly embarrassing for them, so it says that it will be around 9.5 per cent. The truth is that the Government has no idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating said as recently as December 1990 `We are setting up a market economy but built around a compassionate policy', and then last night he announced obscene taxation cuts for the likes of Senator Tate, who is on $100,000 a year. He will be picking up about $2,500 a year as a result of this package. But the 3.9 million taxpayers and the people least able to defend themselves, the low income groups, part time and casual employees, mostly women, students and the aged&mdash;all those who are simply eking out a living on the side&mdash;get absolutely nothing at all. That is a travesty of social justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most extraordinary thing of all was when Senator Button today was asked for his assessment of the social justice implications. From where I sat it was quite clear that he had not a clue what the question meant; or, if he did, he was so acutely embarrassed that he had no answer to it. Of all people, who had to come over and give him some advice but Senator Richardson, who was in earnest conversation with him, presumably explaining to him how to spell the term and desperately trying to find some sort of rational justification for the policy. But there is not one. It is simply a naked bribe aimed at the middle classes in the desperate hope that somehow they will clutch at it and be grateful. Well, they will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also verging on the obscene, after years of being told that welfare is being targeted and is going only to those most in need, to find that we get this ridiculous one-off handout of $125 by way of family allowance for those who have fewer than five children and $250 for those who have more. That is the very antithesis of welfare targeting. People on $75,000 can be eligible for this sort of handout. What are they meant to do with this $125? I suppose they could buy 2 1/2 bottles of Veuve Cliquot, or maybe another hub-cap for the Mercedes. But could anyone in his right mind suggest that those people are in need of that sort of assistance? The people who are desperately in need of more help than a one-off transparent bribe are those who are out of work and those on low incomes. But here we have a payment that will go to anyone earning less than $75,000 a year, irrespective of their circumstances. </PARA>

Where is the sense in that sort of cheap and transparent gimmickry? It is quite clear that this is conscience money; it is an apology for the recession we had to have, but it is utterly irrelevant in terms of solving economic problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sort of derisory payment to voluntary agencies of about $2m this year is really put in perspective when one considers the cynicism of the way in which the Government is going to hand out this $125&mdash;by personal cheques from the Prime Minister. The cost of postage will probably be about the same as the amount of money that the Government is handing over to voluntary agencies in order to alleviate distress in the community. Can honourable senators think of anything more cynical than that, anything worse by way of wasting taxpayers' funds? That money could have been given to the agencies, in spades. Indeed, the sort of money that is being handed over in these $125 payments is of the order of several hundred million dollars&mdash;a $317m package in one-off payments. As a number of welfare agencies have said, that money could have been much better applied if it had been given directly to charitable organisations to disburse. The Anglican Home Mission Society said that last night. The Sydney City Mission said that putting a bandaid over the wound was not going to heal it. It is quite clear that, as the Anglican Diocese of Newcastle spokesman said, this is little more than a bandaid measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact remains that the Government could not use this money less effectively if it tried. If it were in any way serious about trying to help those who have suffered most from the recession, it would not give the money to fat cat public servants; it would not disperse it in such a way that it almost dissipates it by sending off 1.9 million cheques. Indeed, it would give the money to voluntary agencies. Yet the money was there for the taking&mdash;because it is all unfunded. Instead, what happens? None of it will go to them except a miserable $2m, and $3m next year&mdash;for what it is worth&mdash;presumably after the election so the Government does not have to deliver on it. The cynicism is breathtaking. One can only conclude that the people who made these sorts of decisions have long since lost touch with reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating has now been in this place for about 24 years. One would have thought that he had pride and self-respect, that he had tried over the years&mdash;putting all that hyperbole and euphuistic nonsense aside&mdash;and was somehow interested to establish a reputation for some degree of economic rationality, and that perhaps he was sensitive to some of the charges about what had happened to his predecessor but one when he had a fairly extravagant Budget in his last term in office. All of those lessons seem to have gone for nought, because we have Mr Keating here simply being prepared to throw it all on one roll of the dice, to be about as profligate as he could ever be in expenditure terms&mdash;not just in one year but, if this package were to be taken seriously, which of course it will not, a commitment to spending of the order of $20 billion over the next 4 years with nothing more than pious hopes about how it will be funded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To talk about labour productivity increasing by 300 per cent I would have thought is pretty breathtaking stuff. To talk about GDP going up by a factor of two within the next 12 months is again defying recent history when there have been very modest growth rates. Indeed, labour productivity has been averaging less than 1 per cent over the last five years and all of a sudden we are talking about 1.5 per cent. So the figures are not just rubbery; they are unrecognisable if one is serious about arithmetic. Of course, that shows the hollowness and emptiness of this whole package. It does not tackle any of the fundamental issues. It does not do any more than aggravate our economic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Mr Keating were fair dinkum, if he really wanted to get Australia back on track, it is not very hard to work out what he has to do. He certainly has to tackle some of those labour market rigidities and some of those rorts that go on around the country in terms of work practices in government business enterprises and elsewhere and he certainly has to embark on economic reform. He has done none of that; it is all in the too hard basket. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was suggested last year that Keating should stop the Government's disgraceful early retirement scheme&mdash;which is laughingly known as superannuation&mdash;by raising the preservation age from 55 to 60. That is a perfectly rational proposition which every responsible commentator would endorse as a means of closing off the double dipping gap. But what was Mr Keating's response? It was, `We will not do it because it is too difficult politically and industrially'. In other words, there is not one rational economic argument for not doing what must be done; simply that Bill Kelty and the ACTU will not wear it. Look at the sort of veto that the ACTU is able to continue to exercise on this country. There will be an announcement tomorrow which presumably will mean that we will see more of it. We will certainly see a lot more of it in terms of superannuation over the period of the next weeks and months because we know that this progressive impost&mdash;a $4 billion payroll tax on employers&mdash;will simply be funded from their own retained earnings and profits; it certainly will not come out of the pockets of workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the likes of Senator Cook, who has to be the ultimate member of the club, had the grace to concede last year that perhaps workers ought to bear some share of the burden in terms of contributing to superannuation, but there was not a skerrick of a suggestion that that will happen in practice. There was simply a reaffirmation in last night's statement that the whole of the burden will be borne by employers&mdash;up to 9 per cent&mdash;and some vague waffle about the other 3 per cent being funded by a combination of wage restraint and tax cut trade-offs. We all know that is a fiction. It will clearly be a 12 per cent employer impost within a period of eight years. That is totally unsustainable, about the last thing the Government would ever want if it were serious about economic recovery. To pretend, as people such as Kelty do, that somehow this will not have any inflationary impact, that it will not cost any jobs, is again simply showing breathtaking cynicism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One does not have to go through all of the areas in which the Government could have tackled reform, if it had been fair dinkum, to have some idea of the missed opportunities and to understand that this does virtually nothing to address Australia's economic difficulties. Sure, accelerated depreciation is a worthwhile initiative. Sure, there are a few other little bits and pieces around the place. But can anyone seriously suggest that this even amounts to tinkering at the edges? It clearly does not. If the Government is talking about giving business some $2.5 billion worth of assistance over the next five years, when what we have in mind is a fully funded $20 billion worth of concessions and seven tax replacements for business, it is not hard to see that there will be a very real gap between the respective packages. In some ways, it is quite extraordinary that business has not recognised that as yet, but I hope that some of the captains of industry do have some second thoughts and look beyond their noses and realise that if they want to live in a country that is going to turn the corner&mdash;not one that is simply going further and further downhill and which will force them offshore&mdash;then the economy needs a very great stimulus and not the sort of nonsense that is being put forward by a very desperate Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To urge the Federal Airports Corporation to provide common user terminals is a classic cop-out in industrial relations terms. To propose an unfunded contribution of $41m over the next three years to ease the burden on exports does not just pale into insignificance beside our $1.7 billion relief under the Fightback package; it simply shows that the Government is not particularly interested in boosting exports and trying to right the trade balance. A $15m handout to Austrade over the next three years is nothing more or less than pandering to the Public Service Union. </PARA>

In the New South Wales coal industry, drag lines are being managed by three people whereas in the rest of the world they only require one. A local council in New South Wales is having to spend $6,000 in overtime just to have someone unlock a chain admitting cars to the local tip.

We are supposed to believe that the Government has announced a massive stimulus to the economy. The facts simply do not support this contention. The Prime Minister has announced measures amounting to less than $500m this financial year. That means that the immediate stimulus is an increase in this year's outlays of less than half a per cent and 1.5 per cent in next year's Budget program.

I think that the Local Government Association put forward some excellent propositions on behalf of local councils to fund worthwhile projects at the local level. I happen to believe that local communities can best identify the needs in their communities. They are very well placed to channel and supervise funds needed for those communities.

The Prime Minister is claiming that Australia now has a world competitive depreciation regime. But what Mr Keating conveniently did not remember to tell us is that, up until 1988, Australia had a more generous depreciation regime&mdash;it was destroyed by him when he was the Treasurer&mdash;than the one announced last night. Similarly, the so-called development allowance is basically a less generous yet more targeted investment allowance which was originally introduced by Prime Minister Fraser and axed by level playing field Keating in 1985.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two tax decisions in particular which show that the Government does not understand ecologically sustainable development.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first environmentally bad decision is the sales tax reduction for new motor vehicle purchases. It is Democrat policy to tax cars on the basis of their fuel efficiency. The sales tax reduction should apply only to fuel efficient vehicles. This will reduce our consumption and hence our importation of oil, thereby reducing the current account deficit&mdash;something which everyone keeps bleating about but does not seem to make the vital connections. The second decision is the increase in the depreciation rate for tourist accommodation from 2.5 per cent to 4 per cent. We think the best thing to do is to encourage efficient design by granting the higher rate of depreciation only to energy efficient buildings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The infrastructure bonds are an innovative attempt at boosting long term private sector development projects. Whether they will assist the private provision of infrastructure is a moot point. The Government's own figures do not estimate any activity in this area until 1993 or 1994. There are some tax carrots for small business, which we support, the most important being the increase in the capital gains tax exemption for goodwill from 20 per cent to 50 per cent. The goodwill exemption was created by the Democrats when the original capital gains tax legislation was passed. Then there is the token measure of delaying this year's first company tax payment for small businesses by nine weeks. I do not think this will do much to usher in a recovery and neither do the small business people, judging by the reception they have given the package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Financial deregulation is again championed in this statement. We are to have more foreign banks. These will be allowed to operate at a wholesale level as a branch instead of as a separate subsidiary. This undoubtedly means that the Reserve Bank will not be able adequately to supervise the banks which are operating as branches, not as subsidiaries. We are told that this is okay because foreign central banks will be supervising them. The world has just seen the collapse of a significant international bank, BCCI, which was not prevented by the international monetary authorities. This ideological worship of foreign financial institutions is simply a manifestation of the cultural cringe. Mr Keating made much today in the House of Representatives about our cultural cringe towards Britain, about being bootstraps to the British. I think Mr Keating could well look at his own record in respect of Australia's cultural cringe to foreign investment, to foreign banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The ultimate hypocrisy can be seen in the decision to grant a 10 per cent income tax rate to profits earned by offshore banking units. This approach was explicitly rejected by Mr Keating while he was Treasurer in a press release issued on 1 July 1986. The Government cannot see its way clear to assist the productive industries of the twenty-first century in appropriate individual ways, yet it bends over backwards to cater to unproductive paper shuffling by granting the most generous tax regime possible. Senator Button admitted today that such arrangements had been rorted overseas, especially in Singapore, and that therefore this Government would ensure that the concession was not abused. I think we have to ask: how can we be sure this can be done?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last taxation matter I wish to mention is the so-called income tax cuts to be paid over the next few years. These are politically motivated and politically targeted. They do not favour, as Senator Alston pointed out, those with the lowest income. They are simply directed to neutralise the proposals of Dr Hewson. Two weeks ago Mr Keating said he would not get into an auction tax with Dr Hewson, but obviously he has not been able to resist the temptation to do so. Mr Keating's priorities are clear. Ordinary workers are promised a maximum income tax rate of 30 per cent in four years, and offshore banking is to face a maximum tax rate of 10 per cent from 1 July this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important matter I have been able to identify from my interest in this package is the proposals concerning foreign investment. The Hawke and now Keating governments have successively weakened and liberalised the pathetically meagre controls Australia imposes on foreign investment. The Foreign Investment Review Board is merely a part of Treasury which approves about 98 per cent of the proposals that come before it. The foreign investment decisions contained in the One Nation package are nothing short of scandalous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating did not have the courage to say to the Australian people, `I have been Prime Minister for two months and in that time I have decided that virtually all foreign investment proposals should proceed without any controls'. Sure, it is in the text, but not a word did he convey to us orally. He did not say it because he knew that the Australian people feel very strongly about this issue. He did not say it because he knew that it was an outrageous proposition. He did it so that the financial markets would continue to give this Government the thumbs up. In this package the Government has proposed that the previous threshold for automatic consideration of proposals by the Foreign Investment Review Board be raised from $5m to $50m. That is an intolerable difference. That means that any business or farm or building worth less than $50m can be bought by foreign interests without any assessment of the effects of that purchase. </PARA>

What on earth do the beef cattle producers of this country have to learn from overseas interests? Nothing. They are the best in their field.

<SPEECH PAGE="419" SPEAKER="Baume Sen M.E." NAMEID="LE4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (10.30 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to note the passing of two important Australian musicians. Both contributed in their different ways to the development of musical activity in Australia. Both were friends, people whom I respected and certainly people whose musical ability was undoubted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first person I want to talk about was Werner Baer, who has been properly described as an elder statesman of classical music in Australia. He died on 28 January, aged 77, after a long illness. Mr Baer, who lived in Castlecrag, was an outstanding accompanist, organist, lecturer, choir conductor and composer, a former ABC music supervisor for New South Wales and a founding musical director of the Sydney Jewish Choral Society. He also played the organ for me, for which I was always grateful, at my first wedding, which was 29 years ago last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Werner Baer was born of middle class Jewish parents and grew up in Berlin in the 1920s. When he was aged only 3 1/2, his mother heard him naming the notes as the piano tuner struck the keys. At six he went to his first opera, which was the marvellous Mozart opera <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cosi Fan Tutte</EMPHASIS>. At nine he wrote his first composition and at 12 he took up the organ. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1932, Werner Baer enrolled in Berlin's High School of Music where a teacher was the marvellous pianist Artur Schnabel. In 1938, the synagogue at which Mr Baer was organist and choir master was burnt down. Six weeks in a concentration camp followed, after which Mr Baer was issued with an exit permit for Thailand. When Japan entered World War II, he naturally left Thailand. He came to Australia and enlisted in what was then known as the Army Labour Corps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1951, Werner Baer joined the ABC as a New South Wales music supervisor and took on other roles such as Program Director in New South Wales, Assistant Director of Music and Music Editor. At one stage he was responsible for the staffing and administration of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are various sides of Werner Baer. He was a person who unfortunately did not enjoy good health. There are those who have taken the view that sometimes he could be a little hard to get on with, perhaps because of these successive illnesses. Some people did see him as perhaps a little bit of a martinet, irascible and prone to flashes of temper. I would say that to an extent, though, he set such high standards himself that he did have difficulty putting up with people who did not meet those high standards. I must say that everyone who was in contact with him had the highest possible regard for him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Werner Baer was certainly very prominent in the Australian Jewish community. The music critic of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Jewish News</EMPHASIS>, David Brown, said in his obituary that Mr Baer was well known throughout the Australian musical community but that within the Jewish community his undoubted talents often went unrecognised and unappreciated. This was despite the fact that he had taken up the position of founding Musical Director of the Sydney Jewish Choral Society, which of course achieved great status despite his poor health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I last saw Mr Baer at the opera in Sydney a few months ago. He was looking frail and ill. I rejoice in the fact that his life enabled him to contribute so much to Australian music, but I regret that we have lost such a significant influence in the Australian music scene. To his wife, Sibilla, daughter, Miriam and son, David, I certainly send my condolences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other musician that I would like to mention here tonight is John Douglas Gordon, who was my choir master at St Albans's Church of England, Lindfield&mdash;longer ago than I would like to admit here. He was the first person to play the Canberra carillon. He was the Australian expert on carillons. When John Gordon was an arts undergraduate in 1932, he began his unique 59-year association with Sydney University and its carillon as a skilled performer, composer, arranger, teacher and author. In fact, his 1928 treatise, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notes of the Art of Carillon Playing&mdash;a Guide to Students</EMPHASIS>, featured his own composition arrangements and theories on quadrangle acoustics and became something of a classic reference book in the formation of Australia's first carillon school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Gordon was born in Sydney in January 1915. He graduated as an MA from Sydney University in 1939. He had also gone to the school that I went to&mdash;North Sydney High. He was honoured by the Queen with the medal of the Order of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Gordon was appointed the first carillonist to the Canberra carillon and gave the inaugural recital on 26 April in the presence of the Queen and Prince Philip. So in nearly 19 years at the Canberra carillon tower, John Gordon gave some 350 public recitals and trained many students, including the six currently active Canberra carillonists. As George Howe, the Deputy Canberra Carillonist, said in a tribute to him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He was truly a dedicated artist who, since his youth, gave virtually all his energy to music.</PARA>
<PARA>I simply place on record in the Senate my tribute to John Douglas Gordon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make a total break from that atmospheric, I will now regrettably become involved in an argument with Ms Wendy Fatin, the Minister for the Arts and Territories. If Ms Fatin's interview with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 17 February is an indication of what her style is going to be as Minister for the Arts and Territories in dealing with the Opposition, I am afraid it will be a stormy time and we will have an uncomfortable relationship. I do not take kindly to being as ludicrously misrepresented as Mrs Fatin has managed to do. I hope that it is only incompetence rather than malevolence that has led her to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Fatin says in this interview that she is appalled by the Opposition's plan to cut arts funding by $43m under a GST. That statement is totally, ridiculously and self-evidently false and Mrs Fatin should be embarrassed for having been led into saying it by what I presume to be some overenthusiastic staff. If in fact it was her own invention, I suppose we will have a difficult time together. That will be unfortunate because I must say that I had the highest personal regard for her predecessor. I found that Mr Simmons and I could agree to disagree on many matters but we never ever became involved in misrepresenting each other's positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is possible to exist in political life without entering into the style of behaviour that Mrs Fatin has evidenced in this statement. David Simmons was regarded highly by the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, the Australia Council and people in the arts community for the good job that he was doing within the constraints of government policy and particularly within the financial constraints imposed upon him. My original disappointment, distress and sorrow that he was losing that job&mdash;firstly, because of our personal relationship and, secondly, because I think he had done a good job&mdash;was compounded by seeing the sort of nonsense that Mrs Fatin is prepared to utter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first place, the $43m alleged cuts is in fact largely due not to cuts in the arts at all. In fact, the cuts to the arts element of the arts portfolio&mdash;that is basically, the Australia Council&mdash;are specifically and deliberately not aimed at any arts grants whatsoever that are based on arts criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, there are some grants that are not based on arts criteria which are subject to cuts. They are minimal, probably less than $1m. But as is clearly and uncomplicatedly stated in a document which is incapable of honest misinterpretation, there will be no cuts affecting the funding available to arts based arts programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We point out in the GST package that the delivery of $53m in arts money through the Australia Council costs $8.6m to administer. In other words, it costs $1 to run the Australia Council to distribute every $6 of grants. Quite frankly, I would rather see arts money going to the arts and not to the arts bureaucrats&mdash;not to the people running the Australia Council. Some of them are very good, but it does not mean that they should get a bigger and bigger proportion of the arts dollar, and that is what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of all that, the Australia Council is managing to continue to increase its own Council programs, I think last year by 23 per cent, while cutting the delivery of arts money to arts organisations. For example, last year all the arts groups, with only one exception, suffered funding cuts. The exception was the Literature Board, which received an increase. All the rest suffered funding cuts, with the exception of course of the Australia Council's own Council programs, such as the Donald Horne talkfest&mdash;which strikes me as maybe being worth while but not at the expense of arts money. I do not see why these gatherings of intellectuals&mdash;I suppose I am expressing sour grapes; I am not regarded as an intellectual so I was not invited&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I could have gone and sung. The honourable senator is quite right. These talkfests may be of great intellectual stimulus to some people, but to my mind they are an improper diversion of arts money away from the arts. That is the area that I said was to be cut. There are to be no cuts to arts grants. Yet we have Ms Fatin complaining about my plan to cut arts funding by $43m. Maybe she was mistakenly looking at a whole lot of other things. Maybe she was lumping in the cuts to the Australian National Gallery, the National Library, the National Museum of Australia and the National Maritime Museum. That must have been what it was. If she was, she was being equally dishonest because the cuts there are cuts to capital programs in 1994&mdash;in other words, after those programs have basically been completed anyway. It was a clear warning to those organisations that in a recession they cannot expect to keep getting capital programs funded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Ms Fatin meant that, it might have been a nice idea if she had been honest and said so, but to present that as arts funding cuts is a disgrace and she ought to be ashamed of herself. Maybe she was looking at another section&mdash;film. There is no doubt that there will be some cuts in the area of film. In fact, under the Government's funding programs there is to be a significant cut in grants to film in the coming years unless the Government changes its mind which, quite frankly, I expect it to do. But what I had said was that the Opposition would support the continuing Government policy, which was to diminish the role played by grants in funding Australian films and increase the proportion provided by way of tax incentives to those people prepared to invest in Australian film. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's policy is this: this year's grant to film, including all film activities, of $91.3m is projected in the Government's latest Budget Papers to be almost halved in 1992-93 and slashed from $91m to only $16.8m. That is a cut of $74.5m by 1993-94. If anyone is slashing arts funding, one could claim, if one were prepared to be as dishonest as Mrs Fatin&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If she is being blatantly political, without a care for the welfare of her portfolio, then maybe that is the motive that is involved. But it is extraordinary. I have said that, instead of facing this cut in grants of $75m, which would proceed if the Government's policy did not change, I was going to limit the cut to $20m under the Fightback package. That is exactly what I have said. I said that the coalition government will accelerate the rationalisation and privatisation of the film industry and its financing as it no longer needs to depend so heavily on Commonwealth funds. I said that this follows our overall policy commitment to freeing industry from government intervention and dependence. With grants totalling almost $112m, including the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, plus considerable tax expenditures worth more than about $20m, film receives 50 per cent more government grants than all other arts in Australia combined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's policy of reducing direct funding is now being reviewed before the expiry of the present grants program next year. To avoid undue disruption to the industry during its transition period, the coalition will limit the reduction in direct assistance to $20m in the first instance. This will be reviewed subsequently. I then said that in addition Film Australia would be privatised and so on and that total savings in film in terms of direct grants would be $27m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe what Mrs Fatin has done is added all these together&mdash;the end of the capital works program for the Australian National Gallery and all those other museums, libraries and so on&mdash;added up the film situation where we are limiting the fall to $20m instead of the Government's Budget figure of $75m, added up the $4m only of cuts to administration and to the non-arts activities of the Australia Council and come up with this magic $43m. That seems to be the only explanation for her extraordinary statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be one other excuse she might have for misrepresenting the facts or distorting the truth or falsely representing the coalition's figures. I thank Senator Patterson for those three alternative suggestions. The reason may be that there is a deliberate and disgraceful attempt to attack, by dishonest means, the coalition's Fightback package and its position on the arts through organisations that the Australia Council happens to fund with government money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Ms Fatin has said is exactly the same deceptive nonsense that a magazine called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Arts Action</EMPHASIS> wrote before Christmas and to which I responded vigorously. What I find intolerable is organisations which receive funding through the Australia Council, allegedly for arts purposes, using that money to run blatant, dishonest political attacks on the coalition's arts policy. If organisations such as that think it is their moral duty to spend taxpayers' money which is directed towards the arts in that kind of political dishonest smearing of my policy, then I will say to those organisations that they underline the need for arts money to be redirected back to the arts, instead of their being diverted for political stunts supported by a member of the Parliament in a Ministry in a disgraceful comment to a newspaper. Exactly the same figure is used; exactly the same nonsense is spoken. It is funded by this Government, funded through the Australia Council, diverted away from the arts to which the money should be directed. Ms Fatin should be ashamed of herself. </PARA>

<SPEECH PAGE="423" SPEAKER="Bell Sen R.J." NAMEID="7U4" PARTY="AD" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Tasmania)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (10.51 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to take a few minutes to raise a matter which has had some considerable publicity in recent days in Tasmania. The recent attacks on environmentalists who are blockading the road in the Picton area in Tasmania are not isolated incidents, as readers of most of Tasmania's newspapers might have assumed. These attacks are instead part of a pattern of violence and harassment that has been present in the area near Geeveston in southern Tasmania for many months. The so-called `greenies' who are now in the area have simply become an easy and very public target for the sorts of vandalism and harassment which have been taking place and which were directed at other people previously. The State Government's inaction in regard to the attacks&mdash;and both the Field and Groom governments have to take some responsibility&mdash;has in effect given consent to the activities of local thugs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Premier Groom's comments last night on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ABC News</EMPHASIS> in Tasmania that the blockade is not peaceful, that the protesters are inciting the attacks, and that no further police action is required, condones the violence against environmentalists and ignores the facts behind the story. I would like to present to the Senate some of the facts behind that story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One relevant fact is that the tourist group Tasmanian Expeditions has experienced considerable harassment while taking tourists into the Picton area. This group used to camp overnight at the Tahune Reserve before a day's rafting on the Picton River. The groups have been frequently kept awake by a gang who would get drunk, shout verbal abuse at the tourists, throw beer cans at them and urinate on the camping area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In early December last year this behaviour became so serious that one guide left the reserve in a mini-bus to call the police. He was chased by cars, which attempted to force him off the road, ramming the bus several times. The tour operator is trying to press charges, but has met some resistance from the police in the area. He has had to be very persistent just to get someone to come from Launceston, a considerable distance, to take evidence such as paint scrapings, headlight glass embedded in the bumper bar and that sort of thing. Several people are able and willing to identify the people involved in the attack&mdash;they know who it was. The operator no longer camps in the area because of the risks involved, and instead stays at a youth hostel, which means extra travelling and expense for him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only a fortnight ago when this tourist group stayed at a cabin near the river the same gang of thugs appeared again, shouting and jumping on the rafts that were to be used. They were chased off to the other side of the river, where they started throwing rocks. One rock went through a camper's tent and struck a person inside. All these incidents have been reported to the police and to the Ministers responsible for tourism and police. The operator, Mr Lars Winberg, says he has no faith in the willingness of the police to do anything about this. They know who does this but no action is taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Charlie Brignell from Wandering Albatross, another group, had a group of guides on a training camp in the Tahune Reserve in late November last year. This group was also abused by the gang; the incident included shots being fired into the air. Now when they take tourists into the area they do not stay overnight if there is any sign of this gang. He feels that reporting it to the police is useless because they will do nothing, and indeed have done nothing when other operators have reported similar attacks. Mr Brignell says that there is also concern about recriminations from the gang if they are reported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation now is that there are some people who are protesting about forest activity in the area. The protesters who are at the blockade which has been established there are also convinced that this violence is not new and is not happening just because the protesters are in the area. The tourist operators are justifiably angry that nothing has been done previously. They have expressed real concern that it will not be long before somebody takes the law into his own hands and people will be seriously hurt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rumours abound about gangs and teams ready to `take out' the protesters. This becomes more likely when the government of</PARA>
<PARA>the day in Tasmania virtually says that the blockaders are getting what they asked for. </PARA>

We come to this chamber to make laws for the good government of this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) On 13 December 1991 the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) announced that it was satisfied that Mr Kerry Packer had withdrawn from the Tourang consortium bidding for Fairfax. The ABT was informed by Tourang that no arrangements exist for Mr Packer to return to the consortium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The only publicly available material on Mr Packer's earnings is in the returns of Consolidated Press Holdings (CPH), lodged with the Australian Securities Commission. From those returns, it is not possible to isolate the magazine and television activities of Mr Kerry Packer from his other business activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CPH, (excluding media interests) is involved in chemical manufacture, resort operations and primary production. According to the latest annual accounts for the financial year 1989-90, CPH reported pre-tax earnings of $182.7m. Prima facie tax payable on this amount would be $71.2m but due to allowable deductions CPH paid tax of $17.0m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nine Network Australia Limited (NNAL), of which CPH owns a 39% share, reported a preliminary pre-tax operating profit of $55.7m for 1990-91. In its preliminary accounts, NNAL has allowed a provision for tax of $20.8m (after abnormals) which is approximately the normal company tax rate of 39 cents in the dollar on reported earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimated earnings of the Australian media interests of Mr Rupert Murdoch are not distinguishable from his other interests in the accounts of News Corporation. According to the preliminary accounts of News Corporation for 1990-91, the interests of all News Corporation subsidiaries in the Australia/Pacific basin reported earnings before interest and tax of $332m (down $94m on the previous year). Some of these subsidiaries are involved in activities other than print and electronic media. It is not possible to establish from these accounts the amount of tax paid to the Australian Taxation Office by these Australian/Pacific Basin interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">  (3) Mr Packer's private company CPH paid 9% of its 1989-90 net earnings in tax. Nine Network Australia Ltd has made provision to pay tax of 41% of earnings in 1990-91.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The STD lines catering for calls from Brisbane to Cairns during weekdays remain fully available for weekend call traffic.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although call traffic at all other times does not exceed the existing available capacity, AOTC is currently providing additional circuits between Brisbane and Cairns which will increase the existing capacity by 44 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Land Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The figures referred to by Senator Watson from the Medical Journal of Australia appear to come from a publication titled "Effectiveness of Safety Belts and Airbags in Preventing Fatal Injury" by Dr David Viano, a renowned biomechanical engineer from the United States of America.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Officers of the Federal Office of Road Safety are well aware of Dr Viano's work and have held detailed discussions with him in 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 14 per cent to 22 per cent reduction in risk of death to the driver refers to fitment of an airbag alone, ie when the occupant does not use any other form of restraint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report acknowledges that airbags have limited effectiveness in side impacts and are not effective in roll-overs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report notes that lap shoulder seat belts, as fitted in all Australian vehicles, provide 38 per cent to 46 per cent reduction in risk in all types of crashes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Viano estimates that when airbags are used in conjunction with lap shoulder seat belts, the combination has the potential to further reduce fatalities by 3 per cent to 5 per cent. Dr Viano acknowledges that this estimate is based on expert judgement and not on statistical methods applied to crash injury data. The statistical sample upon which this study was based did not contain crash data involving airbag equipped vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other research based on actual crash data involving airbag equipped vehicles, the airbag when used alone is credited with reducing the fatality risk by about 21 per cent, and when used together with lap shoulder belts by about an additional 9 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In earlier research Dr Viano estimated that the combination of airbags and improved technology seat belts may be able to provide up to 15 per cent reduction in fatal injury risk beyond that provided by basic lap shoulder belts. This estimate is based on the expectation of 100 per cent lap shoulder seat belt usage. If the more realistic seat belt usage rate of 80 per cent is assumed, Dr Viano estimates that a 5 per cent injury reduction risk can be expected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Airbags can provide additional protection against injury in frontal and near frontal impacts. Research currently under way on behalf of the Government is seeking to identify the total reduction in road trauma (including injuries and fatalities) that can be expected in Australia, with various combinations of restraint improvements. This is expected to be published by the middle of 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Australian motorist enjoys the benefit of vehicle safety standards which are amongst the most stringent in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our rules are largely harmonised with international standards, although Australia has led the world in a number of safety areas such as seat belts and safety requirements for Forward Control Passenger Vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is determined that Australia will maintain its position at the forefront of international developments in vehicle safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have taken the initiative of allocating an additional $10 million for road safety research and public education over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is actively pursuing future improvements in the level of protection offered by modern cars. A major study was commissioned in 1989 by the Federal Office of Road Safety to examine how vehicles are performing in real life crashes with a view to identifying areas for improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report recommends the examination of a number of measures to improve occupant protection. This research is well advanced and results are expected by the middle of 1992; airbags are only one of these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the Australian point of view, the debate focuses on how to achieve the optimum protection against the background of our high seat belt wearing rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years, dramatic developments in seat belts and a range of new safety technologies have offered an effective alternative to airbags. We need to look at all these options.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of airbags is still high in spite of the economies of scale. Airbags have to be engineered into a vehicle from the early design stages. They are not simply `add-on' options like a different sound system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The recent media attention on the sales tax and import duty on airbags has focused on vehicle models near the luxury tax threshold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have put in place a comprehensive test and research program to determine the real facts and provide guidance on the most cost effective way to ensure the level of safety enjoyed by all Australian motorists continues to be at the forefront of international standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Road Trauma Advisory Council has considered the sales tax applying to vehicle safety items. I understand that the Council is to recommend to the Government that innovative vehicle safety items such as airbags and high technology seat belts supplied over and above the requirements in vehicle safety standards should be exempt from sales tax. The issue of sales tax exemptions will be considered when the Council's final report has been received.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although AOTC does not intend to extend the Economy rate to include all day Saturday for all customers, flexi-calling plans to be introduced shortly will give customers greater flexibility to choose a plan which offers discounted rates over periods other than those currently offered.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The television industry's Code on the Portrayal of Violence on Television which was launched in March 1991, was developed by the industry in conjunction with the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal.
