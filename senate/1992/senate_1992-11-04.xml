So we asked that the Estimates Committee meet in camera so that we could have that information presented to us without prejudicing the investigations or charges that possibly would be laid against people. Since there were allegations of misappropriation of taxpayers' money, we felt that the Committee ought to know the circumstances. We have asked that the Committee meet in camera.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Patterson has made out her case, but it is important that this is not a precedent that is followed in any manner of means as being a normal course of action to take in Estimates hearings. The whole value and importance of the Estimates procedure is that it is an open scrutiny of the public accounts. The value of people knowing that it is all on the public record is most important. The people 20 years ago, in framing the outline in which the Estimates committees would work, noted that there should be an opportunity if, in the most extraordinary and serious circumstances, it was considered necessary&mdash;and it had to be considered necessary by the Senate deliberating upon the matter as a whole&mdash;that that should occur. I think it is important to have it on the record that the case can be made out, and indeed Senator Patterson has made out her case, but it in no way should become a precedent that it should be an easy course of action to ask for evidence to be taken in camera in Estimates hearings. If we deliberate on the issue in that light, then we can reach a sensible conclusion without prejudicing in any way the very significant and important point that Estimates hearings are always, except in most serious circumstances, conducted in full public view. </PARA>

The matter should not be considered behind closed doors unless the Senate feels other considerations should be given to the matter. But we are not told these considerations. In addition to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 17 September, all we have to go on is the special report of Estimates Committee D consisting of half a page. I quote again from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During its consideration of the estimates for the Department of Social Security on 17 September 1992, the Committee was refused certain information pertaining to the reported use of departmental printing facilities for personal purposes, on the grounds that Australian Federal Police investigation and court action were in train. The associated disciplinary action under the Public Service Act that the Department had taken was also not disclosed fully.</PARA>
<PARA>That is by the Department. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> transcript of evidence of 17 September 1992 . . . refers to the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The Committee is not satisfied that the Department conveyed to it a full and frank picture of the matters surrounding this issue. However, the Committee does not wish to jeopardise possible legal proceedings dealing with the matter. It considers that the matters which concern it are sufficiently serious and have potential revenue implications which warrant the leave of the Senate to enable the Committee to consider them in more depth in an <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">in camera</EMPHASIS> hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. The Committee will therefore be seeking the leave of the Senate to reopen its examination of the estimates of the Department of Social Security in private session on Thursday 5 November 1992 at 9.30 a.m.</PARA>
<PARA>This Senate regards its Estimates committees as a very important tool in bringing to account the Executive Government through the Minister and officers of the various departments. We are talking about revenue matters and, in the words of the Committee, `serious questions of revenue'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a duty of this Senate to ensure that the Estimates committees are not, as it were, muzzled. The function of the Estimates committees is to ensure that the details relating to the appropriations for various departments are put on the public record. After all, we are dealing with taxpayers' money and the taxpayers are entitled to know what is happening with their money in the particular departments. It is not sufficient for a department to say, `We are not going to give you the information in public session so that the taxpayers can hear what is going on; we are not going to give it to you because it might jeopardise possible legal proceedings'. To my mind, that is just not good enough. </PARA>

Furthermore, the Department says that it is not going to give the details of associated disciplinary action that has been taken under the Public Service Act. It is not going to give that to the Parliament. The only reason that is given is that it might jeopardise possible legal proceedings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my remarks on this legislation during the previous sitting week of Parliament, I was dealing with the necessity for infrastructure reform, particularly in the transport arena. I made the point about the impact of the flow-on effect of payroll tax and fuel excise. I wish to enlarge on that and will use Treasury estimates to highlight the impact of these taxes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Fightback the abolition of payroll tax will save the transport industry $121m per year, and the abolition of fuel excise will save $679m per year. The abolition of wholesale sales tax will save $408m per year and the net flow-on impact of the GST payment would cost $58m. This is a total saving of $1.15 billion. To get down to the nitty-gritty, the impact on the transport industry is a saving of $1.20 per tonne or 1.34c per tonne kilometre. Of course, one can easily calculate that that is on an average haul of 90 kilometres, which I believe is an underestimation of the average haul throughout most of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous Prime Minister acknowledged on a number of occasions that the road transport industry in particular&mdash;and the transport industry in general which includes rail&mdash;pays excessive tax in comparison with other industries and other aspects of the economy. In fact, it has been estimated that the tax burden on the road transport industry is three and a half times the average of other industries in this country. When one looks at the figures and at the way that indirect tax hits the road transport industry, one can see that that is very close to the mark. The challenge for the current Government was to do something about this, but it has not. In fact, it has done the dead opposite. It has increased fuel excise and has given notice of that. In addition, it is reducing expenditure on roads by some 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we compare that with the Opposition's proposals under Fightback&mdash;and this is crucial as far as the transport industry is concerned&mdash;firstly, we will abolish the various direct taxes, but in our first term of government we will not put in place a road user charge. Of course, that will bring very significant benefits to the road transport industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example of the cost of transport in this nation can be seen if we look at the costs incurred by a bogey drive triple axle truck or semi-trailer. If such a vehicle travels 130,000 loaded kilometres per year, the overall saving for that operation will be some $44,000 a year. If that is taken further, the National Transport Association has told me that one of these trucks needs to travel 250,000 kilometres a year to break even, and the saving under our proposals for that operation will be of the order of $80,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will have significant benefits to all Australians&mdash;producers, consumers and those people who utilise goods and services in their daily lives. It is a measure which will go a long way towards addressing some of the fundamental problems in this country, problems that cannot be ignored. These problems are measured by two horrible statistics. The first is unemployment which has now reached a figure of one million&mdash;and this has been stated many times&mdash;and the second is the number of bankruptcies as a result of which some 30,000 companies have gone broke in Australia in the past two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last financial year, we saw once again under this Labor Government an increase of 28.2 per cent over the record level of bankruptcies of the year before. During the term of this Government, particularly in the last four or five years, the level of bankruptcies has increased by in the order of 20 per cent to 25 per cent per year over the record levels of the previous year. That is an indictment of the Government's failed policies and of its inability to address the fundamental issues in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time remaining, I want to refer to some aspects of industrial relations in New Zealand, about which I gave notice at the beginning of my speech. With the complete reform of New Zealand's taxation and industrial relations systems, that country has gained a 25 per cent competitive advantage over Australia. The question to be asked is: what has New Zealand done to make companies such as Heinz Global invest in New Zealand to service the Asian market with horticultural products? In short, it is because the New Zealand Government has reformed public infrastructure, government administration and the labour market. Secondly, and very importantly, the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions has now resolved not to return to a national award system or to compulsory unionism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result&mdash;and Heinz is a classic example&mdash;is that companies which should be continuing to operate in Australia have moved to New Zealand because of the very competitive advantage of doing business in that country. There have been some other beneficial results: the participation rate in employment in New Zealand has gone up; and real wages have increased by 1.3 per cent in recent months, as against the fall in wages in Australia of 2 per cent in real terms during the life of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until such time as the Government grasps the nettle of these issues&mdash;I have already mentioned transport, and the necessity for taxation reform and real labour market reform&mdash;we will not see substantial falls in unemployment in Australia or a change in the trends of company bankruptcies. The two go hand in hand. It is obvious that if that number of companies and small businesses are going out of business in Australia, employment opportunities must fade away. That is the terrible legacy this Government has brought upon the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the best summaries of the disaster route we are on comes from the Government's own papers. In the One Nation program the projected Budget deficit figure from 1991-92 to 1995-96 was $18 billion. In the Budget that was brought down just three days short of six months later, that estimate went up to $50 billion. What a debt-ridden disaster! It is a legacy this country will carry for a long time, and future Australians will cop the burden of paying most of it back. One must target one particular person for the financial management of Australia over the 10 years&mdash;the former Treasurer and current Prime Minister (Mr Keating). He has managed to take this country's foreign debt, in gross terms, from $23 billion to about $190 billion or, in net terms, $150 billion. It would be fair to say that Mr Keating has `debtitis' as well as `recessionitis'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating has destroyed the aspirations of more businesses by sending them bankrupt than any other Treasurer or Prime Minister in the history of this nation. He has put more people out of work and on to the unemployment list&mdash;one million&mdash;than any other person in the history of this nation. I am glad that Senator Cook is in the chamber because he is also well aware of the number of underemployed people in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training heard evidence last week in Perth, Western Australia&mdash;the State from which both Senator Cook and I come&mdash;that 35 per cent of Western Australian youth are unemployed, another 33 per cent are underemployed and about 31 per cent have a full time job. That is the legacy that this man&mdash;Mr Keating, the current Prime Minister and the failed Treasurer&mdash;has left this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the previous Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, said in about 1982, anyone who leaves a legacy of the order of one million unemployed people has no right to govern this country. I am sure that, on the basis of that figure, the bankruptcy figures, the blow-out in our national debt, the fact that our current account is totally out of control&mdash;we are going into debt at about $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion a month; and last month it was $1.7 billion&mdash;the Australian people will judge very succinctly the fact that this Prime Minister has failed this nation miserably. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know we have the Victorian Loan Council cover-up and other problems, many of which Senator Crane outlined in the speech that he has just completed. But most Australians are concerned about the high level of unemployment in our country at the present time. This problem is far and away the most important political and economic challenge facing all of us who represent the people of Australia. Every single issue that we discuss in the media and in Parliament and every debate in which we engage ought to relate to what contribution we might make to solving Australia's unemployment problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is no stranger to the art of misrepresentation. Not so long ago he told us that the recession was over. I have not seen very much sign of that happening. He is no stranger to deliberately distorting facts in an argument. He is no stranger to sweeping aside the relevance of fact and the relevance of truth when it comes to confronting a political or an economic issue in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of unemployment, the Prime Minister has actually stood in the Federal Parliament and said, `Unlike other countries, the Australian Labor Government does not use the unemployed as a buffer at the end of a railway track'. I want to look for a little while at what happens in those other countries. If Australians were asked to nominate four nations with which we could compare our economy, most of them would instinctively say America, Japan, Britain and Germany. Others might have a different mix but the majority of Australians, when they think of international comparisons, would probably still grab at those four countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the unemployment level in Japan? It is 2.1 per cent. What is the unemployment level in the United States? It is 7.2 per cent. What is the unemployment level in Germany? It is 6.8 per cent. What is the unemployment rate in that dreaded Thatcherite Britain or, I suppose now, Major Britain&mdash;the scorched earth relic of all these terrible policies that the Labor Government complains about? The unemployment rate in the United Kingdom is 9.8 per cent, as against Australia's 11 per cent, with almost one million unemployed. In other words, the nation of Australia, whose Government does not use the unemployed as a buffer at the end of a railway track, has a lamentably worse employment record than countries such as Germany and Japan; a worse unemployment level than the United Kingdom; and a much worse unemployment level than the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the scale of world comparison, we see that the Prime Minister of this country is the world's greatest unemployer. He really takes the cake, the prize, for having put more people out of work, comparatively, than any other country with which it is reasonable to compare the Australian economy. The Prime Minister can talk all he likes about participation rates and he can talk all he likes about growth figure comparisons, just as I can talk all I like about the number of unemployed people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us who represent Australians in the Federal Parliament would know quite well that, as well as the 11.1 per cent of our fellow countrymen and women who cannot get a job, probably another 8 or 9 per cent are working a two-day week, a three-day week or a four-day week as an alternative to losing their jobs. The true unemployment and underemployment rate in this country is probably around 20 per cent, or one in five. That is the measure of the despair and achievement of our greatest unemployment creating Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is trying to take away the focus of the Australian people from the fact that a Labor government of almost 10 years standing has presided over the worst unemployment level in this nation since the years of the Great Depression. That is something that would make Labor predecessors such as Curtin and Chifley turn in their graves. It is an achievement of which anybody who is dedicated to the interests of working men and women in this country would be ashamed. Rather than confront it, rather than try to debate the issue in an intelligent fashion, rather than try to explain to the Australian people why 180,000 people in the private sector have lost their jobs over the past 12 months, rather than try to explain to the Australian people why there has been a decline of 4.2 per cent since the middle of 1989&mdash;which I would say was the employment peak&mdash;in the number of people employed in the private sector and rather than try to acknowledge and attempt to embrace some long term policies to improve the Australian economy, the Government is, to its great shame, washing its hands of the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How else could we describe the Prime Minister's statement recently that the recession was over? He is doing all this in the name of diverting the gaze. The old injunction about bread and circuses is very true about the Prime Minister and this Government.

All of this is being done in the name of diverting public gaze from headlines about private employers losing 180,000 jobs and from the fact that the Government's unemployment record is disgracefully worse than the unemployment record of countries with which it is fair to make comparisons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government deserves to be condemned not only for the slump in private sector employment but also for destroying the hopes of millions of Australians and sending them to the depths of dismay and despair through its reckless economic policies. It does not try to solve our economic problems; it only services them. It does not create real jobs; it just hides people off the unemployment queues. I believe those job subsidies and job creation schemes just do not work. They do not create real jobs. Yes, they give people shovels and line them up with the local councils, but those jobs stop and the shovels disappear when the money stops. They are not real jobs; they are mickey mouse jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the Labor Party's training scheme? The Government will have people trained but there is no link to the workplace. Australia will end up with the best trained and best educated dole queues in the world. It does not solve the problem. It hides people away from the unemployment role in training schemes. It puts money into government buildings, yet we have a glut of office space in Australia. It does not deal with the problems; it only services the problems. The Labor Government is not about job creation; it is about vote creation. It is about vote creation by spending money it does not have to buy those votes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August the Government presented a Budget that will not bring home our bacon. It was simply a Budget that was designed to save the Prime Minister's bacon. I am not really talking about his private business interests when I say that, either. It is not a document for the future; it is a document by a government that has no future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we think back to the period when we were growing up, to some of the circumstances that existed and to what were our hopes and aspirations in this country&mdash;I suppose one could say that it is a long time since I was at the stage of growing up, but there are quite a number of younger senators in this place&mdash;never would we have contemplated the possibility that we could have one million Australians unemployed. We would never have contemplated the possibility that the number of unemployed could reach one million. We would never have contemplated the possibility that this nation could be almost $200 billion in debt. We would never have contemplated the situation in which hospital queues were getting longer, or the situation where 50,000 or 60,000 young people could not get into university, as was the case this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Think of all the job and education opportunities that were available when we were leaving school. One would never have contemplated the possibility that so many Australians would actually feel like strangers in their own country&mdash;that they would feel excluded or thrown outside the system in their own country. But that is how so many Australians feel today in the circumstances of the worst recession in 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those days, who would have thought that when we grew up and had children we would be looking down the gun barrel of leaving our children a lower standard of living than we have enjoyed ourselves? But that is the bottom line of what is happening in Australia today. If anyone had suggested to me even 20 years ago that countries such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and even Japan could have out-performed us significantly in the course of the period in which we grew up and ultimately matched our living standards, I would genuinely have thought them out of their mind. Japan's standard of living was two-thirds that of ours in 1970; it passed Australia's in 1980. Now, in the 1990s, we have less than two-thirds of its standard of living. Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan&mdash;places that do not have a lot of natural advantages in an economic sense&mdash;are about to match our standard of living in this decade. Madam Acting Deputy President, you would not have contemplated that, and nor would I, but that is where Australia is at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important that we stop and ask ourselves why this has happened. Why is it that a country so well placed and so uniquely placed and with such an abundance of natural resources and so many opportunities has squandered those opportunities in the course of this current generation? I think the principal difference between the Labor Party and the National-Liberal party coalition relates to the increasing role of government and the influence of government in the country over that period. Government and bureaucracies have got bigger and bigger over this period. They have got more intrusive and more regulatory. There is more participation in business and more control over the lives of average Australians&mdash;and that more than anything else has had the fundamental effects that we are observing in our economy today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government has significantly reduced the private sector's capacity to create wealth and jobs. We believe that the private sector is the essential mechanism by which jobs are created in this country. Real jobs and real wealth are created in the private sector. The continual growth of government and the squeezing and the suffocation by government have driven the private sector backwards and are destroying its capacity to create wealth and to create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, of course, I think of union control and the demands of unions upon employers. The pervasiveness of government has squashed individual incentive, it has restricted individual freedom and it has restricted individual capacity for choice. Just think about how tough it has become for someone to start a business, for example. Dozens of approvals, licences and forms have to be dealt with in order to get a business under way. The stifling effect of increasing government and increasing government regulation have done the job. Here I might mention that, even as far as hostels and nursing homes are concerned, there is a tremendous amount of paperwork that has to be done. During the last fortnight's recess I visited quite a number of nursing homes and hostels during my touring around Queensland, and I heard so many of them saying that these days so much time is given to filling in the papers that are required by governments to keep their hostels and nursing homes going that they do not have enough time to give to the care of their people. That to me is a very sad state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at some other effects of the size and the influence of government, one of the most disturbing is the increased dependence that has emerged on government. Welfare dependency today is roughly double what it was in the early 1970s in Australia. Nearly four million Australians are on some sort of welfare assistance at present&mdash;a major impact in terms of dependency not just for individuals but for businesses. Most disturbingly, it has had a very significant effect on our attitudes. People are constantly being led to accept less than the best. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National-Liberal Party coalition believes that real wealth and real jobs are created through the private sector; they are not created by building another bureaucracy. They are not created by spending money that you do not have because, ultimately, that money has to be paid for. Ultimately, that expenditure has to be funded, and that can have a very significant effect on the total supply of jobs and wealth in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key difference between the Labor Government and the coalition is that we believe in the private sector; we believe in individual Australians; and we believe in the forces of the market and the forces of competition. The Federal Government instead believes in the big brother, the big, overbearing, suffocating government that is supposed to provide all the answers. That is why we put our emphasis on average Australians. We believe that Australians are able to match and able to beat the best in the world. Why are we not doing it with our economic performance at present?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes in setting a government framework that provides the mechanism whereby the private sector can carry the main task which it is good at, at what it can do, which is generating wealth and generating jobs. The tragedy in this country today is that the Government tries to reduce everyone to the lowest common denominator. Government suffocates the process. The private sector is driven out backwards. Jobs are permanently lost, and we are left with major social and economic trauma in this country. We want to reverse that process, to put our faith back in individual Australians, to give individual Australians choice. We want to give them the opportunity of getting greater control over their lives. On this side of the Senate we are for less government and more focus on business, cutting business costs, giving businesses the scope to get out and do what only they can do, which is create wealth and create jobs by matching the best in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government does have a responsibility to look after the disadvantaged, and we take that seriously. We do it in a way that targets that money very effectively and we set out to increase the assistance given to those who are genuinely disadvantaged while creating the circumstances where people can actually get out there and get a job, generate wealth and rebuild this country to the potential that we all know it really has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For far too long the Government has tried to make people believe that people can be taxed to the hilt without destroying incentive. The Government has adopted the attitude that everyone can be granted the same wage rise without destroying initiative. For far too long we have kidded ourselves in this country that government money can be thrown at every single social problem without destroying self-help and self-respect. For far too long in this country the Government has loaded business with red tape, green tape, black tape and a host of cost disadvantages and tried to pull the wool over our eyes by saying that it would not destroy the national wealth. Perhaps most importantly to a lot of Australians for far too long the Government has constantly knocked our country and denigrated our flag with the aim of trying to destroy our national pride. These are matters I feel very strongly about and why I have brought them to the attention of the Senate in this debate today on the Appropriation Bills. </PARA>

As Senator Bjelke-Petersen said, the Government is spending money that it does not have. We have seen plenty of examples of that in recent days. We have seen the loans scandal in Victoria. We know as Australians that we have a $150 billion overseas debt. If there is one thing that the Labor Party has always been good at, it is spending other people's money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appropriations debate and, more particularly, the Senate Estimates committee system, provide members of the coalition with the opportunity to get a true picture of what is happening in government departments. In recent times, I recall some huge amounts of Government waste. I also recall some examples of waste of government money which are not so large in amount but are equally as important. I remember the $8m that was spent on a munitions factory at St Marys in Sydney which never produced one shell or bullet. It is going to be bulldozed and a new factory is going to built at a greenfield site somewhere else. That is just one little example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the Estimates committees one has an opportunity to highlight various areas of waste and to research what has happened. It seems to me that over recent years a trend has emerged of a blow-out in the use of consultancies by government departments without a corresponding decrease in the number of public servants. The Commonwealth is very good at making State governments cut back on their expenditure. From what we have seen over the last few years, apart from one or two departments it seems that there has been no effort by the Commonwealth to cut back on expenditure. I notice that Senator Bolkus's department seems to be cutting back on its expenditure in certain areas. But, generally speaking, there does not seem to be any great effort to try to save money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, in August it was revealed through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth Purchasing and Disposal Gazette</EMPHASIS> that the Attorney-General's Department had spent $278,212 of taxpayers' money to promote its changeover to a user-pays system. As you would know, Madam Acting Deputy President, the majority of the clients of the Attorney-General's Department are government departments. So, in effect, the Attorney-General's Department spent over a quarter of a million dollars promoting itself to a closed group of clients&mdash;a captive audience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just for the record, some of the expenditure is quite unusual. The Attorney-General's Department spent $26,000-odd on special key rings and mugs for its employees to mark the event. It spent $3,921 on a client liaison function for other government departments at the old Parliament House. A client liaison function is more effectively known as a drink or two, I suspect. On top of that, it spent another $4,111 for a two-day hire of a conference room at the Lakeside Hotel for meals and further talks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then it spent another $34,000 for a national satellite television hook up. It spent $100,000 for design and printing of a corporate device and style manuals. It spent $21,900 on marketing and training, another $34,000 on market research consultancy services, and another $8,776 on a marketing strategy. It topped that off with $20,000-odd on the printing of a legal practice brochure, $10,700 on a contract list brochure, and another $13,500 to engage an outside consultant to coordinate the production of its annual report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Tate would know, I raised these matters before Senate Estimates Committee E. I was quite amazed by the number of consultants that were used. In order to promote itself to other government departments, which are going to use it anyway, the Attorney-General's Department used Reark Research, Tarqin Ralph, who is an in-house consultant, Bowden-Sexton, Robert Poulton, Kelly Parkinson, Marje Prior and Gattorna Chorn. All these different groups were used to make sure it did everything correctly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, we found that the person who produced the Attorney-General's annual report was none other than Mr Nihill, the press secretary to the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. In addition, it appears that the Attorney-General's Department has kept 400-odd mugs. Officers of the Department have told me that the mugs will be held in reserve and handed out to new staff as more are employed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An amount of $3m was spent by the Attorney General's Department on consultancies during the year; only five consultancies were publicly advertised. It seemed quite unusual to me that the Attorney-General's Department would spend almost $40,000 in order to conduct an inquiry of government departments as to the value of services provided by other government departments. Quite frankly, I would be surprised if there were no officer within the Attorney-General's Department who could undertake that exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went on a bit further and found that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission employed 40 consultants at a total cost of $1m, with only two of those consultancies having been publicly advertised. I know it will be said that there is a selective tendering process and a list of names. But once that list of names has been compiled, is one then on it for ever and a day, and what hope does anyone else have of obtaining a place on it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the worst examples of the Department's closed shop approach to the tendering process was the awarding of a $242,000 tender over a period of four months to Admiral Computing to assist the Department&mdash;only to `assist'&mdash;in selecting tenders for the law enforcement access network; that is $60,000 a month. The company concerned is based in the United Kingdom and it appears that no-one from the Department of Administrative Services or the Attorney-General's Department even bothered travelling to the United Kingdom to negotiate the details of contract with the company. At the end of the Estimates hearings, the Committee was left in a lot of doubt as to what had been the role of Admiral Computing, and even whether its work had been completed. Representatives of Admiral Computing have gone back to the UK and, as far as I am aware, the tender for this particular network has not even been let. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It became very apparent from the evidence placed before Estimates Committee E that there is a complete lack of control over the use of outside consultancies. Accordingly, it is very difficult for the Government or any particular department to claim that the best person for the job gets the job, nor can they claim that the exorbitant rates paid by the Australian taxpayer are justified. The other day I noted that Dr Anne Summers received the princely sum of $86,000-odd for a three-month consultancy within the Prime Minister's Department. </PARA>

One can discover these things only by questions on notice or through questions at Estimates; they are not generally available to the average politician, unless he or she does a bit of digging. But the closed shop mentality of the Attorney-General's Department is demonstrated by the fact that only five of a total of $3m worth of tenders were advertised.

There was a massive $1m blow-out from the 1990-91 Budget to the 1991-92 Budget; a figure of just on $3m was reached by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Included in that sum was a consultancy of $68,800 to obtain advice on architectural and building services in relation to the Lodge. That means that in just two years $165,000 has been spent on obtaining technical advice on both Kirribilli House and the Lodge&mdash;just advice, nothing else.

There is one program in this area you would be most interested in, Madam Acting Deputy President.

Only last year I criticised the expenditure by the Film Finance Corporation of $270,000 to assist in the funding of a movie that has had a fair bit of publicity in recent weeks, a sex movie starring American porn queen Annie Sprinkle.

I am pleased to see that the Minister, after some letters from me highlighting this matter and other suggestions the group made regarding anti-social behaviour, cut their funding. Nevertheless, $1m of taxpayers' money went in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that really interests me is the amount of money that has been spent on upkeeping Government House, Admiralty House, the Lodge and Kirribilli House. There have been huge increases over the last few years. No doubt these places have to be maintained and the gardens have to be kept in good order. In regard to the Lodge, in the period from 1975 until 1982, when Malcolm Fraser was there, a total of $1.3m was spent, or an average of $166,000 a year. Since then, from 1983-84 until the present day, a total of $4.5m has been spent, or an average of nearly half a million dollars a year&mdash;an average increase of 195 per cent per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With Kirribilli House, in Fraser's days a total of $61,500, or an average of $7,600 a year, was spent on upkeep. In the time of former Prime Minister Hawke and the present Prime Minister, a total of $500,000, averaging $55,000 a year, or an increase of 621 per cent a year, has been spent. For Government House the gross figures are staggering. I know the place might be falling down, but since 1983 until today a total of $9.487m has been spent on Government House in Canberra. A lot of money has been spent on this new Parliament House, but for goodness' sake, for $9.5m one could just about build a couple of new Government Houses. For Admiralty House, $2.7m was spent between 1983 and 1992. There is no doubt that this Labor Government is very good at spending taxpayers' money and other people's money. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard this morning speeches attacking the former Government in Victoria, and I want to come to that because it is an example of what may well happen were a coalition government to be elected. It is all very well for the coalition to attack the Government, as one would expect it to do&mdash;after all, that is what oppositions are for&mdash;and it is to be expected that it would attack unions because unions have been chosen by the coalition as the traditional scapegoats for the ills of the nation. One can understand that, but one cannot understand why the coalition's prescription to cure what it sees as the faults of the Labor Party and the unions is not so much to attack them as to attack the workers. That concerns me. It concerns me that people should be attacked not because of what they have done but because of what others have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at what has happened in Victoria, one can see the merit of what I say. When that Government was in opposition it attacked the then Labor Government&mdash;which, as I said before, is the purpose of an opposition&mdash;and it attacked the unions, who are the traditional enemies of the Opposition. However, when the coalition got into government in Victoria, it attacked the ordinary workers, the people who go about their business and who may well have voted for it. These people have done nothing but lead decent, ordinary lives, but they are saddled with what in effect is a poll tax&mdash;a $100 tax on a house, no matter what the size, locality or worth. </PARA>

Why should people who have nothing to do with the ALP&mdash;in fact, many of them may have voted against the ALP&mdash;who are injured through the fault of their employer, through the fault of others, and have been made to leave work because they have not been fit to go on, have their right to sue taken away?

Within the terms of this legislation, it could be a local milk bar, a hotel or a factory making Easter eggs. These are all situations which a reasonable person might say would not attract the title `vital'. But if the Governor-in-Council declares that the chocolate factory producing Easter eggs is a vital industry, it becomes a vital industry. Once that happens, the people working in that situation, be they members of a union or not&mdash;and they well might not be&mdash;have to continue working and not raise objections to the situation. Indeed, if they raised objections, if they interfered, induced or attempted to interfere with the facilities of that factory, they would be guilty of a criminal offence. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr John Howard is a person who is entitled to great respect as a shadow Minister and parliamentarian. Nevertheless, he is coming forward with a program which causes great concern. He is saying, `We are now going to set up a system which in effect promotes the common law as the basis for industrial relations'. It sets aside a legislative framework such as now exists, and brings in the common law to resolve disputes. Mr Howard says that there will be no need for unions because there will be an office of the employees' advocate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does this mean? It means that if a person wants to sue his or her employer, the management, at common law that person can go to the employee advocate and does not have to pay for the services of that advocate. But does that cure the problems? It certainly does not cure the ills of the common law&mdash;and I want to come to them&mdash;nor does it overcome the problem of getting on in court, and there are plenty of cases waiting to be heard in the common law court. Nor does it overcome the problem that, if he or she, the worker, loses the case, he or she has to pay the costs of the other side. He or she might claim $800 wages and has to go to common law. He or she could be told by the employee advocate that is the correct course but at the same time he or she could be threatened with a bill of $1,500 or $2,000 if he or she loses the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with the coalition's approach in this area is that it is based on a wrong philosophy. It is the philosophy of the individual, that the individual matters, no matter what. It is the philosophy of the marketplace, that the marketplace determines all, no matter what. It is the philosophy of the strong against the weak. I understand that philosophy, and it is a choice that will be put to the people of Australia. But, as I have said before on other occasions in this place, it is not the philosophy that I adopt and it is not the philosophy that people like the present Pope adopts. He makes it quite clear that the free consent of the parties, the bargaining in the marketplace, is not what should guide the reaching of a just wage. In his encyclical, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Centesimus Annus</EMPHASIS>, talking about an earlier Pope, Pope Leo XIII, he immediately adds another right which the worker has as a person:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the right to a `just wage', which cannot be left to the `free consent of the parties', so that the employer, having paid what was agreed upon, has done his part and seemingly is not called upon to do anything beyond.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly the sort of thing that we agree with as far as the Pope is concerned but which the other side does not agree with. The Opposition agrees that there ought to be free consent of the parties&mdash;as long as a deal is struck with the employer, that is enough. The other thing that has to be remembered is the importance of the union movement, which again is not given its proper place by those opposite. The Pope had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, `humane' working hours and adequate free-time need to be guaranteed, as well as the right to express one's own personality at the work-place without suffering any affront to one's conscience or personal dignity. This is the place to mention once more the role of trade unions, not only in negotiating contracts,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">not only in negotiating contracts, but also as `places' where workers can express themselves. They serve the development of an authentic culture of work and help workers to share in a fully human way in the life of their place of employment.</PARA>
<PARA>The point about all this is that the argument, the debate, in this place on the Appropriation Bills, as far as I have heard, and I have not heard them all by any means, seems to be intent, as far as the Opposition is concerned, on attacking the Government and unions. That is all right, but why then bring forward policies, which I have touched upon in the short time I have available to me, to some extent&mdash;there are others I could certainly mention&mdash;that attack people who go about their ordinary tasks, who are simply trying to live a decent life, to bring up their children in a decent way and to enjoy some of the fruits of the earth? Why will those people be punished for what, the Opposition says, are the faults of governments and the faults of unions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should the Opposition adopt a free market individual no matter what philosophy when other people in the world of great moral persuasion come to other conclusions?

<PARA>A policy which declares that an individual employer and an individual employee can fairly negotiate directly on wages and conditions ignores the profound truth of that proposition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet that is what is contained in the industrial policy that is proudly promised by the Opposition. The Opposition has a policy which relies heavily on the common law&mdash;a law which has never, as Senator Tate touched upon the other day, helped the workers. It is a law which gives great weight to the sanctity of contract and the freedom of trade but not to the needs of employees in respect of minimum wages and conditions. There are no common law principles that limit the hours that might be worked per day or which provide for holidays, sick leave or meal breaks. There is no minimum level below which pay must not fall. Indeed, the coalition understands this and would introduce legislation in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been asked to limit my speech, so I will. I again ask those senators opposite who will follow me in this debate to tell me whether they consider that negotiations can be conducted fairly between employers and employees. If they say that the marketplace ought to determine wages and employment conditions, why do they feel that there is a need to put in minimum conditions? Why have minimum conditions if they are so convinced that negotiations can be fair? If negotiations are fair, there will be no need for minimum conditions. If they want to introduce some minimum conditions, why not go further and ensure that there are fair conditions? There is a difference between minimum conditions and fair conditions. Why be so conscientious about minimum conditions and not conscientious about fair conditions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is a need to legislate to ensure that there are minimum conditions, why does not the coalition need to legislate to ensure that there are fair conditions?

There are organisations such as unions that can ensure that minimum conditions and wages are not only negotiated but also that they are fair. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few weeks ago I certainly learned something new, though. I learned something that none of my colleagues on this side of the chamber knew; I learned something that nobody in my home State of South Australia knew. What I learned, much to my amazement, was that the recession was over, and not only was it over but it has been over for some time&mdash;a year or so in fact! Who was responsible for this little gem of information? It was none other than the person who told us that this was the recession that we had to have in the first place&mdash;the Prime Minister, Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that the recession is over for the Prime Minister because he is not even trying to survive on a pension or unemployment benefits. When he loses his current job, as he most surely will, he will not have to support a wife and three kids on the average male wage of about $28,000. Mr Keating can be glad he is not in this average category because otherwise he would also be relying on handouts from the Salvos or any number of other charitable organisations that are under so much pressure at the moment. Why? It is because, as a result of Labor's policies, it is not just the low income earners that need help these days; it is the middle income earners as well. These are people who years ago would never have dreamed of getting help from charity; people who are embarrassed and angry that they have been forced into a position of dependency for the first time in their lives. The Prime Minister really would not know what a recession was if it hit him right between the eyes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recession really means that the family's sole breadwinner's job has been lost; mortgage repayments cannot be met; children go to school inadequately dressed, sometimes without lunch; families can no longer afford the small luxuries in life, like going to the movies; housewives are trapped in the suburbs because they cannot afford the public transport; the phone, electricity and gas bills go unpaid; and parents cannot afford to support their kids through TAFE and universities. And so the list goes on. Really, what would the Prime Minister know about this? When was the last time he could not afford to buy a basic necessity of life?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not as amazed as some that Mr Keating says the recession has ended. After all, he has a record of saying absurd, careless and even heartless things. In 1983 when our</PARA>

<PARA>I could go on and on but I am sure honourable senators get the picture. Suffice it to say that, now that our foreign debt has blown out from $23 billion in 1983 to a disastrous $150 billion in 1992, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Keating Government's economic strategy is to accelerate recovery from recession and, at the same time, build a stronger Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>I think Mr Keating should hark back to his statement in 1985 about the despair and economic failure of the former Government. Who does he think he is kidding? Who has caused the most despair and economic failure since the Great Depression?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, I would be naive to say that the Government has not accomplished anything at all. After all, Labor has become so bereft of policy ideas in recent years that it is inevitable that its policies in some areas would start to mimic some of ours.

What about my constituents, South Australians, who will be paying well into the next century for the $3 billion that the Bannon Government used to prop up the State Bank?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No, the recession is not over and this 1992 Budget will not help one iota. The Government knows it has lost the battle.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This most discerning Government recognises that unemployment is indeed a major contributor to the current disastrous state of the economy and has set up a job creation scheme, which is most commendable. This scheme is aimed at creating opportunities for up to 30,000 people, which is only about 3 per cent of the one million unemployed, by funding capital works programs in local council areas. The scheme is known by the grand title of `Working for the Future' and to justify the importance of its aims it has been allocated $345m to be spent by the end of 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, when the pieces of pie were distributed the lucky recipients turned out to be teacher's pets.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give some examples of this selective form of distributing funds which sees 502 out of 914 or more than 50 per cent of councils miss out on funds completely. In my state of South Australia, in Federal electorates such as Kingston, Makin and Grey&mdash;which the Government is hanging on to by a thin thread&mdash;there are some prime examples: Whyalla, nearly $1m; Port Pirie, $583,000; Port Augusta, $540,000; and Port Lincoln, $473,000. Where are those councils? They are all in the Federal seat of Grey which requires a swing of just over 2 per cent for Labor to lose that seat. Does the Government not know it? The Labor candidate for Grey has been in panic mode for months. Why? Because the voters in places such as Port Augusta, people who have voted Labor all their lives, are telling the Liberal candidate, Barry Wakelin, that for the first time in their lives they will be voting Liberal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the Budget bribes, at least eight metropolitan councils did not receive any funding at all whilst Salisbury got $4.2m and Noarlunga $3.3m. Honourable senators may well ask who holds the electorate covering Salisbury. It is none other than the Minister for Social Security, Dr Neal Blewett. It may interest honourable senators in passing that the corresponding State electorates covering Salisbury are held by the Labor Premier, Lynn Arnold, and his employment Minister, Mike Rann. Where is Noarlunga? It is in the seat of Kingston, currently held by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Bilney, with a margin of just over 4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might also ask: are there no unemployed in Mitcham or Burnside or any other of the seats that missed out on funding? The answer is a resounding yes, the Mitcham Council area has 2,700 unemployed and Burnside has 1,275. South Australia has the worst youth unemployment in the country, with 12,000 15- to 19-year-olds out of work. The official youth unemployment statistic for the State rose to a staggering 40.3 per cent in September. What will happen in November and December, when another 20,000 young South Australians leave school? How many of them will get long term jobs? Will this Government think up another quick fix scheme, costing another few million, to try to stop the inevitable blow-out in the unemployment figures?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South Australia is not exceptional. With some exceptions, nearly all of the $345m to be distributed Australia wide through this working for the future scheme will be spent in marginal and Labor-held electorates. The Government claims that funding allocations are based on the number of unemployed in each region or local government area. If this Government had workable policies that created long term jobs, it would not have to buy back votes at all. This Government has created a monster in the form of an unemployment disaster across Australia that it cannot control. The irony is that it is traditional Labor Party voters who will put the coalition into government at the next election, and they know that this Government is trying to buy their votes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What about the 502 electorates that did not receive any funding at all? I suppose this Government believes there is no value in buying votes in safe Liberal electorates. That is a cynical, hard-hearted belief. Every electorate is suffering unemployment. The pain of one unemployed person is the same as that of another, whether that person is in a Labor-held electorate or a coalition-held electorate. For instance, in Port Augusta the council intends to use its $540,000 on four short term projects, including building a club room, redeveloping Gladstone Square and constructing a boardwalk and car parks. What happens when these projects are finished? What is the Government going to do in the meantime to create some long term employment? Does this Government have a long term plan to help revitalise some of these regional towns? What plans does it have to develop tourism in these areas?  Does it even know what tourist developments are proposed for the areas? There are times when I doubt it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the Government has a clue what is going on in rural and regional Australia. It is too caught up in the cities and the mass work force there to know or care about people who earn far less than their union mates in the cities. Labor says that it is the party of the working class, but I do not believe it would have a clue what work is or what real poverty is. There are a number of people in rural and regional Australia, particularly in primary production, who know what real work is, and what real poverty is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is estimated by the Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics that this financial year the average broad acre farmer in Australia will lose $25,700. I wonder what would happen if we suddenly turned things around and gave farmers an income of $30,000 a year&mdash;which is not unreasonable, given the long hours they work and the wealth they generate for Australia&mdash;and some workers in the cities, such as waterfront workers and those in other industries, lost $25,000 a year. Would the union members put up with it or would they work harder in the hope that `She'll be right mate; things will get better'? Would they stand by and watch as their homes were sold from under them because, no matter how hard they worked, they could not earn enough to break even, let alone make a profit?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister tells us that the recession is over. He should ask the primary producers. The Government should take a long hard look at rural Australia if it is really fair dinkum about getting Australia out of recession. It has to ask itself why every year a thousand farmers in South Australia alone are closing the farm gate and walking away. A few weeks ago, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, actually admitted that more Australian farmers are in trouble, particularly in the wheat industry. While it was very big of Mr Crean to make that admission, it is too late; it is not enough. They are not just in trouble, they are courting disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Crean says that we are also going to lose jobs in agricultural industries, and yet this never gets to the front page of our newspapers. I wonder why the Government is not jumping up and down and talking about the loss of jobs in the rural sector, or is it because it considers that the jobs in manufacturing industries in the cities are more important? For example, in the car industry where efforts have been made to protect those jobs and ensure they are kept, it is very difficult to argue that that industry employs more people. I can tell honourable senators that direct employment in the car industry is approximately 65,000. That is equivalent to the meat and dairy industry alone at 60,000, without counting the grain farmers, the woolgrowers, the fruit and vegetable growers, the vegetable processors, and so the list goes on. I cannot see why these jobs are any less important than those in manufacturing industry&mdash;a job is a job, and a recession is a recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just a few weeks ago the President of the South Australian Farmers Federation, Tim Scholz, put forward a plan to rebuild rural Australia. The item he ranked of highest importance was the reduction of farm costs. So what is this Government doing to reduce imposed costs in order that our farm sector can improve its competitiveness? He also ranked the removal of several layers of marketing groups between the farmer and the market and the provision of commercial finance by the banking sector as very important. As he points out, the Government has its priorities wrong. Why have the interest rates on housing loans been much cheaper than on loans for the wealth-creating rural sector? Why have farmers been penalised for wanting to produce goods for our domestic market and for seeking to earn valuable export dollars?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be the first to agree that houses are important as are jobs in the housing industry. However, the bottom line is that we cannot export our houses to earn any foreign revenue whereas, on the other hand, a domestically and internationally competitive farmer can make a positive and continuing contribution to our balance of payments&mdash;or rather they would do so if they were given half the chance. Instead, primary producers are leaving the land and joining unemployment queues. In fact, rural Australia's population decreased from 21.8 per cent of the national total some 30-odd years ago to 13.5 per cent in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware of the time constraints that we are putting on this debate and I close by making a couple of other comments. This 1992 Budget will do absolutely nothing to arrest the decline of the rural sector or to stop farmers selling up and joining unemployment queues. Why is that? It is because farmers and people in primary production are not traditional Labor voters and they certainly are not protected industry workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least on this side of the chamber we know, following extensive consultation with the rural sector, that we have the policies that will keep farmers on the land and enable them to plan their futures with a degree of certainty and confidence. Some of the initiatives that will ensure this are the doubling of the family allowance for families with incomes of less than $30,000, of which there are plenty in the rural sector, and smaller increases for families on higher incomes; a 6 per cent increase in family allowance supplement; tax credits for low income families who take out private health cover; the abolition of the assets test for assistance for isolated children; the suspension of the assets test for Austudy payment for families suffering hardship; an increase in the dependent spouse rebate; no assets test for retirees living on the family farm; and personal income tax cuts. That is not to mention the abolition of the petrol excise which has a profound effect on people who live long distances from the metropolitan areas. </PARA>

If all these measures were combined, we would have the makings of an economic recovery which might start this country up again and ensure the future of all Australians and their families.

A big impact on rural areas is the fact that we have difficulty getting facilities, services and doctors to move to country areas. This Budget moves to redress that situation. We have moved to redress the shortage of general practitioners in rural and remote areas with the introduction of a comprehensive incentives package. It is more than just offering practitioners money; it is offering them the ability to access locums, to attend in-services and to keep their skills at the levels necessary to deal with the very broad range of medical problems and emergencies that arise for those doctors practising in rural areas, particularly where they may be some distance from large hospitals. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would also see eligibility for a sole parent pension change. Instead of being eligible for a sole parent pension and support until the child is 16, the Opposition plan is to remove that support once the child hits 12. I do not know very many parents who feel happy suddenly having to leave 12- to 16-year-olds at home to their own devices. It is an age where children still require, if the parent has decided that he or she wants to parent full time, some supervision and guidance. Supervision is a strong word, but children certainly require guidance from their family, from their parent. This Opposition is going to remove that choice from the sole parents of Australia. </PARA>

All of those senators who take an interest in rural areas would be aware of the level of interest in land care, and public awareness of the issue is still expanding at a great rate.

The Murray-Darling Basin program includes the allocation of $495,000 to complete the rehabilitation of the Nyngan levees. No longer will we be facing the prospect of helicopters evacuating people from Nyngan as the Bogan River comes over the levee banks. There is also $125,000 for a land and water management program at the Jemalong and Wyldes Plains areas. These are all important issues for the people of rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this Budget, the goal of the Government has been to achieve a more integrated approach to addressing important issues in resource management and to encourage more effective and efficient solutions. A new national Landcare program framework to encompass land, water and related vegetation activities has been developed and will be progressively put in place over the coming year. The programs I have outlined that are contained in this Budget are a measure of the Federal Government's commitment to this plan and to rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another program that has been widely commented upon is the local government capital works program. I am pleased to say that $105m of that was made available to New South Wales under this program. A number of councils in western New South Wales have received significant funding, and I would reply to Senator Ferguson's allegations that these funds have gone to Labor areas by saying that that is an absolute furphy&mdash;the greatest load of garbage and hogwash I have ever heard. I suggest that he go and talk to Mr Cobb and Mr Hicks and to other people to whose electorates some of these programs have gone&mdash;to Mr Anderson in Gwydir, in Parkes, for example. Broken Hill Council received in excess of $700,000 because that area has a high unemployment rate. That is currently in the electorate of Riverina-Darling, which is a strong National Party seat. Senator Ferguson said that the money has gone to Labor areas. That is rubbish. It has gone to areas in need, and that is vitally important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will shortly take some time to look at what the Opposition would do to employment, what it would do to discourage and not to assist local councils or the CES and the Department of Employment, Education and Training in doing something about having effective programs in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It became very clear to this Government that local government has a very important role to play in these programs. That was borne out at the youth summit, where local government could actually say `We have programs ready to go', and they have demonstrated that. The funding under the capital works program will enable councils to implement important local economic, civic, tourist and cultural infrastructure projects and will provide an important stimulus to the local economy as well as worthwhile permanent assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really cannot get past what a Dr Hewson-led coalition government would do to local government. Local government funding would be cut three ways by Dr Hewson and it would be taxed. Direct funding to local government from the Federal Government would be cut, local government funding from the States would be cut, and funding for programs administered by local government would also be cut. Then, of course, a large number of its services would be subject to the goods and services tax or, should I say, the consumption tax&mdash;anything the Opposition deems to be a commercial service. That covers things such as rates, electricity, water supply and sewerage. The list goes on and on; it depends on the services local governments offer. These are all going to attract an extra tax of 15 per cent where currently they have no tax upon them. That is the sort of thing the Opposition would do in government, and I warn people to think very carefully about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also introduced many labour market programs. In this financial year we are spending $1,150m which will assist more than 400,000 job seekers. We are building on the February One Nation statement. We are increasing the Jobskills program&mdash;$110m will be spent to increase that program. I should tell those people who were complaining that councils did not have access to government assistance that those councils in western New South Wales who did not receive capital works funding and those who did receive it have made very good use of the Jobskills program. They have used that program to enable them to undertake a number of projects which are already of benefit to their community. They are a twofold benefit to the community because the facilities are being built, repaired or maintained and jobs are being provided. This is totally forgotten by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sum of $29m will go to the Office of Labour Market Adjustment. We never hear a thing about that from the Opposition. We are giving money to vocational support and the landcare and environment action program. The list goes on and on. We are looking at and caring about this problem because we have a history of doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, we should look at what the Opposition would do and make a comparison. Firstly, the Opposition would abolish the Commonwealth Employment Service and transfer its activity testing to the Department of Social Security. That is fine, but I start off by saying that there are 53 fewer Social Security offices in Australia than CES offices. I am not talking about small communities. There is no Department of Social Security office in places like Singleton, Cooma, Bowral, Cowra, Young&mdash;and the list goes on. These are not small communities. They have populations of nearly 10,000 and the shires have populations of between 12,000 and 13,000. These offices will be abolished and there will be one less government service to the people who live in rural areas. Fifty-three areas will miss out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not tell us how it plans to conduct the activity testing if these 53 CES offices of the Department of Employment, Education and Training are removed. Some National Party members have suggested that they do see a role for the local employment committee, which I will turn to later. That is an issue that the coalition has totally overlooked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition would transfer the administration of labour market programs to local employment boards. It would contract out employment placement functions and abolish the Jobsearch allowance after nine months. These changes would impact greatly on those living in country areas. Part of the coalition's change concerns activity testing and those who are unemployed for more than six months and less than nine months will be required to provide fortnightly letters from two employers, plus have proof that they have contacted four other employers, saying that they have actually gone looking for jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In small rural communities there might only be six businesses which employ people. What will the people do? They will be forced to keep revisiting these businesses once a fortnight to get their piece of paper and after nine months they totally lose their Jobsearch allowance. We are told that those in need will be able to apply for special benefits. Of course, the criteria to qualify for special benefits will be tightened up. Any senator whose constituents have attempted to access special benefits these days would be very much aware that this benefit is very difficult to get. The Opposition totally disregards that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to local employment boards, which is another one of the Opposition's plans. The Opposition will abolish the CES and have volunteer bodies coordinating local employment strategies. I suggest that this concept is flawed because there will be no national coordination or approach to job creation or training. It means that each local area will be able to do what it wants to do and be a law totally unto itself. Therefore, people in the same circumstances would find themselves treated differently depending upon where they live. The quality of help would depend upon the time and the energy of the volunteers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would be potential for favouritism, and personalities, family ties and obligations could play an inappropriate role in the decision taken in individual cases. We already have the situation in small rural communities where everybody's business is known by just about the whole community. But this would just expand upon this lack of privacy and increase the loss of privacy and confidentiality that people feel that they should be entitled to if they are unemployed and if they are seeking assistance. I feel that these boards have the potential to divide the community. There is more than a hint in this program of deserving and undeserving poor or unemployed. It reminds me somewhat of the workhouses in England of the last century which were governed by local boards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have grave concerns about the contracting out of employment functions in rural areas. I do not know how it is going to work. Employment agencies&mdash;those that offer their services&mdash;have to be profit making; they have to make money to survive. I do not see the economic rewards being there to encourage them to set up in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an added impost on business because the service has to be paid for by the employer, and it is usually related to the annual salary package of the employee; it is about 10 to 20 per cent of the annual salary. Then, of course, on top of that we have to add the 15 per cent consumption tax because that is a service and it attracts the consumption tax. That is all an added impost to business. It is an impost that it has not had before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also mentioned that the Opposition is going to attack the sole parent pensions, and it is going to raise the age for women's age pensions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With the 1992-93 Budget, the Government has yet again presented to the people of Australia an economic plan which, for the fifth time in 18 months, has failed to address the fundamental problems that are facing this country. The Senate will recall the failed attempts of the Government previously to get the economy back on track, including the May 1991 economic statement, the 1991 Budget, the November 1991 jobs statement, the One Nation statement and this Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ever since I entered the Senate in February last year, this Government has been trying to get the economy back on track, having previously created the situation where Australia was the first country to move into recession. The net result of all these attempts to solve the economic problems that the ALP Government created in the first place with the recession that we had to have has been record unemployment, record bankruptcies, skyrocketing overseas debt and Budget debt, lower real income levels over 10 years, decreased savings, an inefficient tax system, record interest rates for most of its term in office and micro-economic reform which is moving at a snails pace, particularly in the labour market area. Having created this economic mess, this Government has now presented a Budget for 1992-93 which will once again tinker at the edges with no lasting solutions and certainly no vision for the future of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, this Budget is a dishonest Budget. It is a cynical and blatant attempt by this failed Government to try to buy its way back into office. Unlike the coalition's visionary Fightback package, the measures contained in this Budget are simply not financed. As Senator Short said in his opening comment to this debate on the Appropriations Bill, this is a Budget bought on Bankcard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Max Walsh, a noted financial journalist, commented directly after the release of the Budget that what Mr Dawkins has really done is bring down the largest peacetime Budget deficit in Australian history. The stated Budget deficit is $13.4 billion. If this were converted to $1 coins and these coins were placed in a line, they would stretch eight and a half times around the world. Even this shocking result was achieved only by a $1.6 billion asset sale to reduce the Budget shortfall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net figure of $13.4 billion, however, is also rubbery. It is based upon a number of dubious financial assumptions including the predicted profits from the Reserve Bank, the manipulated dividend from AOTC and the clever removal of one Public Service pay period from this financial year to the next. All up, we really have a Budget deficit of $20.3 billion&mdash;I repeat, $20.3 billion. The projected forecasts of the flow-on effect of the Budget are $50 billion, accumulated in deficits that are unfunded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The longest serving Labor Prime Minister of this country, Bob Hawke, has also canned this Budget. He has questioned its credibility and the credibility of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer. The Budget does not deal with the fundamental underlying problems facing the country. It does nothing about economic growth, which ultimately creates jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Budget does not offer any solutions to economic problems; it only services them. It does not create real jobs; it just hides people away in make-work schemes and training schemes to keep them off the unemployment queues. Throwing funds around so that the youth of Australia can go out and paint white rocks is not a way of solving the unemployment problems that face this country. It certainly does not do much for their future prospects either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contained in this Budget is a pathetically transparent attempt at pork-barrelling as Labor tries to buy its way back into government. Despite what Senator West said, the funding made available under the employment scheme for local government areas is quite clearly targeted to marginal Labor seats around the country, with the local government area in the Prime Minister's seat gaining the largest slice. That is bad luck for a person who happens to be one of the long term unemployed in Turramurra in Sydney. Because of the rather peculiar way that this Government distributed the funding, that person's council will receive no additional money under this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Real job creation is about productive long term jobs that do not finish when the Budget money runs out. Job creation also involves removing the restrictions on the private sector, removing the red, black and green tape that so ties up business in this country and letting businesses get on with the job of running business. It involves giving incentives to people to work hard, allowing people to reap the rewards from their work and not putting them in a position where they give most of the money back to the Government through either direct or indirect hidden taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main thrust of Fightback is about giving back choice to individuals rather than letting them be told by Federal bureaucrats what is best for them. Our alternative Budget would have created a smaller, less regulatory government and it would have allowed the private sector to breathe, grow and flourish and, in the process, create the jobs that this country so desperately needs. Under Fightback, seven taxes will be removed, the labour market will be reformed and there will be a reduction in the cost disadvantage to business by 20 to 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback is the most aggressively pro-business and pro-growth policy produced by any political party in Australia's history. A growing private sector will allow business to employ people. It will allow business to take our youth off the unemployment queues, away from white rock painting and into real jobs. A growing private sector will give back to our youth the chance to make the most of their abilities and to seize the opportunities to reap rewards from their work. Fightback will create the economic environment to bring them out of despair and it will give them hope for the future.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ICI at Botany is another example, which shows that a composite annual salary has been developed which replaces the old base rate, overtime and all the other allowances. The Sheraton Southgate Towers Hotel is another of the case examples undertaken in this study. This is the agreement negotiated by Mr Macphee and attacked by Mr Howard. It is a flexible agreement which has produced one all-up rate rather than a series of penalty rates. The South Australian Farmers Union has developed an agreement with its unions in which there is time off in lieu of overtime.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Loosley has always taken a keen interest in these matters, and this is important. From the inception of this Government, we have, in terms of manufacturing and service industries, attached a great deal of importance to innovation. That is why in 1985 we introduced the 150 per cent tax concession for research and development. That policy is now paying off in terms of export figures for highly sophisticated and transformed manufacturing products. That decision in 1985 was an important part of the increase in expenditure by Australian firms on research and development. We have seen through the 1980s a 14 per cent growth in real terms in business or private sector R&amp;D. Over the same period, patent applications overseas by Australian residents were higher than in any other country from the OECD. In this year's Budget the Government announced that the 150 per cent tax concession would be extended indefinitely, recognising the importance of R&amp;D to international competitiveness.</PARA></TALK.START>

It was only on 20 August that Mr McGauran ruled out any change. He said, `The game is over; 125 per cent is what you are going to get'. Now he has announced a change which will introduce an additional shortfall of between $110m and $125m in a Fightback package which already has a $6 billion black hole in it.

This is the Opposition which puts itself up as an alternative government for business.

Is the Minister aware that the Government's tariff cutting program has produced a rising flood of imports with TCF products showing import penetration close to 50 per cent, heavy engineering 60 per cent, furniture 35 per cent, and cars with an increase of 40 per cent in one year alone; and that this rising tide of imports is a major factor in seasonally adjusted unemployment rising from 6.7 per cent only 2 1/4 years ago to 11.1 per cent in June this year? In view of these trends, is the Government prepared to consider a 12-month pause in tariff cuts now that a substantial number of the Minister's own parliamentary colleagues at last weekend's Canberra conference have joined the Democrats, the ACTU and major industry associations in calling for such a pause?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first part of the question makes some allegations about what purport to be matters of fact&mdash;and I do not know where Senator Spindler gets his facts or so-called facts from. For example, the position in relation to textile, clothing and footwear imports is simply this. Last year the import penetration in relation to textiles was 56 per cent, in 1985-86 it was 59 per cent, and it has been higher or as high in most years throughout the 1980s. There is nothing new about the import penetration in relation to textiles. If we take clothing and footwear, import penetration in 1991-92 was 27 per cent, which is one of the lowest figures for import penetration of a so-called sophisticated industrial economy anywhere in the world. It is, in fact, lower than the import penetration for manufacturing generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I may take another example, the imports of motor vehicles, it is true, that went up to 40 per cent and it has since declined. It went up to 40 per cent for a variety of very good reasons, namely, that the market was seeking smaller cars here and we do not manufacture many small cars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler went on to say that the rising tide of imports, as he called it, is a factor in high unemployment, rising from 6.7 per cent 2 1/4 years ago to 11.1 per cent in June this year. What does the honourable senator think was happening to tariffs 2 1/4 years ago or more than 2 1/4 years ago? They were going down and the Democrats were complaining about it. What has happened since? There has been a recession. If the Democrats do not understand that, they ought to have a discussion with coalition members because they do not understand anything else. Have a talk with Senator Panizza. He knows nothing else except that. Senator Spindler ought to have a bit of a chat about that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia has a growing international reputation as a country where there is a low level of industrial disputation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key factors in that is that through the period of our Government, under the accord, we have reduced the level of industrial disputation.

We have shown that we are able to manage industrial relations far better than the coalition could ever hope to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising, therefore, to find that, in the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures released today on industrial disputes for this country for the month of July, almost every record in the book is broken in terms of the low level of industrial disputes. The total number of working days lost in July 1992 was the lowest in this country since 1958, and the total number of working days lost per 1,000 employees was at a record low level. Last year the Greiner Government had industrial confrontation, which wrecked our record a little. The APPM dispute in Tasmania earlier this year&mdash;the closest personification of the Opposition's industrial relations policy&mdash;wrecked those figures again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn now to Victoria and look at the current state of play. The figures for July on industrial disputes in Victoria were a mere 69 per cent below the national average.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Attorney-General. Is it true that the head of the National Companies and Securities Commission, Mr Bosch, personally contacted the Reserve Bank in the seven days prior to the collapse of the Estate Mortgage unit trusts to express his concern about the fund and about the actions of the banks? Who did Mr Bosch meet at the Reserve Bank, what was discussed and was the Attorney-General advised of the meeting? Why did the National Companies and Securities Commission wait a further seven days before acting at a cost of millions of dollars to the 52,000 investors caught in the funds at the time at which they were frozen by the Government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question is probably technically out of order, but I still intend to answer it because it indicates the very real need for the radical reform in the companies and securities area that was undertaken by this Parliament and the Government. This is because, when the National Companies and Securities Commission existed, it was not answerable to the Federal Parliament through a responsible Minister. Responsibility was diffused through the Ministerial Council of Federal, State and Territory Ministers. That is why this Parliament had to take action to establish the Australian Securities Commission to make this regulatory regime answerable to this Parliament through a responsible Minister such as the Commonwealth Attorney-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the short answer to Senator O'Chee's question is that the Federal Attorney-General of the time would not have had the sort of political responsibility to deal with Mr Bosch or to be aware of the activities of the NCSC in the answerable way which the honourable senator implied in his question. I will ask whether the successor organisation, the ASC, can find in its records any evidence of such a meeting that might be helpful to Senator O'Chee&mdash;and perhaps in departmental records. But the key point is that the Federal Attorney-General did not have responsibility for the operations and activities of the National Companies and Securities Commission, nor for its head, Mr Bosch. Therefore I am not in a position to answer any question about Mr Bosch's relations, interviews and discussions with the Reserve Bank, if indeed they occurred at all.</PARA>

I draw the Minister's attention to a letter written to me by Mr Hartnell in which he referred to a meeting between Mr Bosch and the Reserve Bank. What I seek to know is who was present at the meeting, what was discussed and was the Attorney-General advised? Was it a case of the NCSC all on its own deciding to dither for seven days while Estate Mortgage burned, or was it the case that the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, would have preferred it to dither for another seven days while Estate Mortgage burned, to the ultimate cost of the people who invested in those funds&mdash;52,000 Australians?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Today I raised with Senator Tate a very important matter which related to the collapse of the Estate Mortgage unit trusts. At their peak, the Estate Mortgage unit trusts had something in the vicinity of $1.8 billion of assets under control, yet within the space of a very short period of time those assets were dissipated and many of the investors in Estate Mortgage unit trusts have lost nearly all of their life savings.

Whom did he speak to at the Reserve Bank? That is a question the answer to which we must know. What did he say to the Reserve Bank? We know that there were discussions over two days between the Reserve Bank of Australia and the National Companies and Securities Commission. If the Reserve Bank of Australia was fully cognisant of the problems faced by Estate Mortgage&mdash;and I understand that there are some 40 documents in the possession of the Reserve Bank that relate to this, only six of which I have received from them pursuant to my freedom of information request&mdash;we need to know what was done with the information.</PARA></TALK.START>

We all know that ultimately the NCSC froze the funds in Estate Mortgage. Arguably, it should have done it earlier; arguably, it should not have assisted with the dissipation of the assets. But what we also know is that some time after this the Federal Government took it upon itself to freeze redemptions in other property trusts in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not correct for Senator Tate to say that it was a matter solely up to the NCSC. He might be correct in saying that the NCSC may have been acting on its own. But this Government always had the power to step in and prevent the dissipation of the assets from those trusts. Both the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, and the Attorney-General, Mr Duffy, knew that these funds were insolvent or on the verge of insolvency. They knew that they could not meet redemptions. They knew that money was going through the funds in a sideways shuffle, which meant that the latest people to invest in the funds ended up losing out the most.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.there were inconsistencies in the interpretation of Conditions of Service for the crew of the fleet and significant variations in the level of victualling allowances paid to marine crew</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.existing conditions of service led to inefficient work practices. For example, rather than pay large overtime payments, crew were often stood-down or deemed to be on leave, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.some marine officers had not received adequate Customs-specific training following the transfer of the training of marine officers from the Australian Marine College to TAFE Colleges.</PARA>
<PARA>Those concerns expressed about Customs are very serious. The details of the Auditor-General's report underline how absurd some of the practices have been and how ridiculous the management of this fleet of vessels is. This fleet currently consists of 24 vessels located in various ports around the Australian coastline. The estimated replacement cost of the fleet is about $12m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit found that the level of usage of the fleet had decreased substantially over the five years from 1986-87 to 1990-91. This has meant that all classes of vessels were significantly under-utilised, resulting in a reduction in the control and enforcement capability of the fleet. The audit also cast doubt on whether expensive marine assets had been used in the most effective manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Audit Office found no evidence to indicate that the fleet's primary role of responding to specific indicators of unlawful activity was not being performed, but no records are maintained which would confirm this. However, according to the Auditor-General, other secondary but nonetheless important roles, such as conducting routine patrols of designated risk areas, were not being performed fully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most extraordinary features of this under-utilisation of the fleet is that the 14 collector class vessels&mdash;that is, the majority of the vessels&mdash;were utilised for only 50 eight-hour shifts per year. Fifty eight-hour shifts, according to the Audit Office, translates into 50 days use in a calendar year. I have to correct the Audit Office; it does not mean that at all. It means that they were used on 50 days throughout the calendar year. It does not mean 50 days usage. In fact, the amount of usage is something like 400 hours out of the 8,760 hours in a year. In other words, these vessels were utilised for something like 5 per cent of the time. This is a classic waste of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General explains that the target rate for this class was originally set at 100 shifts a year, but that this target was reduced to 50 shifts at a regional managers meeting in April 1991. The Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When compared with the total number of days crew are available and, in view of the capital and operating cost of these vessels, the ANAO considers this target to be too low.</PARA>
<PARA>Details of monthly usage are set out in this report. The Auditor-General points out that in one case, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Charles Kingston</EMPHASIS>, a minister class vessel stationed in Geraldton, Western Australia, was utilised for only one shift of eight hours in the three months from 1 November to the end of January 1991. The replacement value of this vessel is currently $3m and its operating costs are approximately $400,000 per year, of which fixed costs including salaries, allowances, mooring and maintenance costs, represent a major proportion. So this major asset was used for one eight-hour shift in three months. During this period, the five marine officers allocated to the vessel were not deployed effectively in marine activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, the audit indicated that that is not an isolated instance; that there has in fact been a significant decrease in fleet utilisation. The smaller collector class vessels have a replacement value of approximately $1.3m. As I indicated earlier, these vessels were significantly under-utilised. According to the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The vehicles required to tow these vessels are leased at a cost of approximately $16,000 each per year.</PARA>
<PARA>There are 14 vessels to be towed. What fascinates me is that the Audit Office revealed the following information about one of these vessels:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Neal located in Fremantle has not been deployed in the South West of Western Australia for some considerable time due to the absence of a vehicle which could legally tow the vessel. Consequently, it was being used for routine patrols along the Swan River and surrounds which are not regarded by Customs to be as vulnerable as the South West coast for the illegal importation of narcotics . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This might have given the Customs officers friendly tours of the Swan River but it was not doing much to block the illegal importation of narcotics. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Lockyer located in Newcastle was not utilised for many months because the trailer was not functioning. As a result, the vessel could not be moved.</PARA>
<PARA>This is plain, straightforward, uncomplicated incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An examination by the ANAO of the utilisation of these vessels since April 1991 found there had not been any marked increase in usage.</PARA>
<PARA>This is despite the fact that in April 1991, Customs decided to examine the need to rationalise the marine fleet and give the Collector class vessels in particular a 12-months trial. The Audit Office now says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overall utilisation of the Collector Class vessels is low and the vessel is not well suited to current Customs' requirements. From inquiries and observations made by the ANAO, it seems that the functions currently carried out by Collector Class vessels, such as yacht checks and river patrols, could be carried out effectively by small dinghies which are carried on Minister Class vessels, or by the ad hoc chartering of suitable vessels. The running costs of the Collector Class is in the vicinity of $900,000 per annum. The phasing out of this class could therefore yield substantial savings. Where smaller vessels are required such as in Sydney, the above savings would be at least partly offset by chartering or the retention of a smaller number of Collector Class vessels.</PARA>
<PARA>In brief, the Audit Office saw no evidence which supported the continued use of the existing fleet size of 14 vessels. Quite frankly, one wonders what is holding up Customs from implementing massive cost savings, rationalising this operation, and diverting the funds towards doing something that would effectively help the fight against the illegal importation of narcotics, which is what I understand it is supposed to be doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This kind of failure is inexcusable. It is extraordinary that it requires the Auditor-General to point out to the Customs Service what should be and is patently evident from simply taking a quick look at the utilisation rates and what is happening. This is one of those classic examples of inefficiency. I commend the Auditor-General for once again drawing to the attention of the Parliament the incompetence of a section of this Government.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">INCOME TAX (INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS) AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will provide legislative authority for the entry into force of comprehensive double taxation agreements between Australia and Indonesia, Australia and Vietnam and Australia and Spain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will insert the texts of the agreements into the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953 as schedules to that Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The agreement with Indonesia was signed on 22 April 1992; the agreement with Vietnam was signed on 13 April 1992 and that with Spain was signed on 24 March 1992. The agreements allocate taxing rights over all substantial forms of income flowing between Australia and those countries. Details of each agreement were announced and copies made publicly available at the time of signature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The agreements generally accord with the other comprehensive taxation agreements concluded by Australia in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A feature of the agreement with Vietnam is that it provides for "tax sparing" credit relief to be extended by Australia for tax forgone by Vietnam under specified development incentives for the encouragement of foreign investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where income derived by an Australian resident taxpayer has benefited from the development incentives to be nominated under the agreement, a tax credit will be allowed by Australia for the Vietnamese tax forgone under those incentive measures. By this means, the development incentives will retain their attractions for Australian firms and allow them to compete for business in Vietnam on favourable terms with investors from other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each of the respective agreements will enter into force when diplomatic notes are exchanged advising that the necessary constitutional processes to give the agreement the force of law in the respective countries have been completed. The enactment of this Bill will complete the processes required of Australia for those purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that the agreements will contribute positively to the strengthening of trade, investment, and wider relationships between Australia and the treaty partner countries. I am pleased to be able to say that Australia is the first country with which Vietnam has entered into a double taxation agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not possible to accurately predict the eventual effect of the three agreements on the revenue, but it is not expected to be significant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum and commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OVERSEAS STUDENTS CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Overseas Students Charge Act 1979 to fix the amounts of the charges payable under the Act for the 1993 academic year. In accord with established practice, the Overseas Students Charge is adjusted annually in line with movements in the index of higher education charges. The amounts payable in 1993 are shown in the Bill. The charges are payable by overseas students enrolled in Australian education institutions under the subsidised program to which the Act relates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ABORIGINAL EDUCATION (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody found that the most significant factor contributing to the over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in custody is their disadvantaged and unequal position in Australian society, socially, economically and culturally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Running through many of the Royal Commission's recommendations is the proposition that eliminating these disadvantages requires an end to domination of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people by non-Aboriginals and the return to them of control over their own lives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The social, economic and cultural factors which contribute to this situation lead to low self-esteem and reduced confidence. It is a national tragedy that Australia's indigenous people remain the country's most chronically disadvantaged group on every social indicator, including health, housing, education and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The poor levels of educational achievement recorded in the cases examined by the Royal Commission is an apt reflection of the level of education participation by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people generally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the 99 cases investigated by the Commission, 40 of those who died had not proceeded beyond primary school and only 2 had completed secondary schooling.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is wide agreement in Australia, including across political parties and among church and community groups, that there is a need to raise the level of awareness of non-Aboriginal people about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history, cultures and contemporary issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For far too long the education system did not offer Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people "a place" and provided no recognition of the richness of Aboriginal culture and history, and the importance of contemporary issues as they affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This blinkered approach must continue to change if Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are to find relevance within our education system and if we are to increase non-Aboriginal people's awareness of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of recommendations made by the Royal Commission seek to achieve this balance. Specific recommendations proposed that the curricula of schools at all levels should reflect the fact that Australia has an Aboriginal history and Aboriginal viewpoints on social, cultural and historical matters, and that Aboriginal viewpoints, interests, perceptions and expectations are reflected in curricula, teaching and administration of schools.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Royal Commission endorsed the joint Commonwealth/State agreement to the 21 goals of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy (AEP). These goals, developed by governments in consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, aim to address the educational inequalities experienced by Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. Strategies to achieve these goals are currently being implemented under the AEP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In endorsing the AEP, the Royal Commission identified areas where more needed to be done, such as the provision of pre-school education, provision of education to prisoners, and importantly, expansion of Aboriginal studies and Aboriginal control of curriculum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill represents a continuation of the Commonwealth Government's commitment to addressing the inequality of education opportunities between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and non-Aboriginal people. The Commonwealth remains committed to overcoming the educational disadvantages faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people which were highlighted by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1989 all State and Territory governments and the Commonwealth government agreed to a Joint Policy Statement underpinning the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy (AEP).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Policy Statement included a commitment by the Commonwealth to supplement its normal provisions of recurrent and capital funding for education in the States and Territories with a dedicated commitment of funds on a forward triennial basis for assisting the implementation of the National Policy through one consolidated <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aboriginal Education Strategic Initiatives Program</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Policy Statement also contains a commitment by State and Territory governments not to diminish funds allocated for Aboriginal education by them because of any additional funds provided by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the introduction of the AEP in 1990, the Commonwealth has provided $214m under the Aboriginal Education Strategic Initiatives Program (AESIP) for initiatives directed at improving educational outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; in addition to other forms of direct assistance to individual and groups. I will table later this session a report on the implementation of the Policy in 1990 and 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill proposes a significant increase to $241m in funding; a 13 percent increase over the first AEP triennium.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister has made it clear to education providers that the implementation of the Royal Commission's recommendations concerning education are the Commonwealth's first priority over the next triennium.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second Commonwealth priority for the next triennium is the implementation of the national Aboriginal Languages and Literacy Strategy, the first component of which is the Aboriginal Language Education Strategy (ALES) which will commence in January 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ALES will support strategies geared towards the teaching of Aboriginal languages in schools. These strategies include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">special "languages other than English programs" in Aboriginal languages for children attending Aboriginal schools;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">bilingual and bi-cultural programs;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">measures for Aboriginal languages curriculum development and materials production; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the provision of Aboriginal bilingual language teaching and para-professional staffing resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such activities will have a critical place in the maintenance of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second component is the Aboriginal Literacy Strategy, also to commence in January 1993. It will support special strategies to improve the English literacy of Aboriginal primary and secondary students, particularly students whose first language is not English. Here again the Minister sees an opportunity to break down barriers, reduce disadvantage, and create positive self-esteem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bilingual and bi-cultural education is essential if strong and weakening Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages are to be maintained. From an educational perspective it is vital that a balance be found between the maintenance of Aboriginal languages and the teaching of English literacy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The acquisition of knowledge and skills to allow Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to live without disadvantage in the wider society on the one hand, and the retention of Aboriginal culture on the other will continue to be a challenging issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to turn now to the third priority of the Commonwealth for the next triennium, the National Reconciliation and Schooling Strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The role of Aboriginal studies, both as a discrete area of study and as an integral part of all curriculum&mdash;from preschool education through formal schooling to post-schooling and higher education&mdash;is vital to provide a proper foundation for future relations between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians and in bridging the gap between home and school for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aboriginal studies will make a significant contribution towards the process of reconciliation. The negative attitudes towards Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on a large range of issues need to change. These attitudes form the basis of negative myths, generally based on ignorance or misinformation which are the foundation of racism and prejudice. These myths are major obstacles in the development of harmonious cross-cultural relations and have had their foundation in the school age education received by most non-Aboriginal Australians. In a very real way, generations of non-Aboriginal Australians were educated to be prejudiced. Through the process of educational and societal change these issues can and will be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process of including Aboriginal studies in the curriculum has created an opportunity for change. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander viewpoints on social, cultural and historical matters are providing much needed opportunities for non-Aboriginal people to redefine and increase the richness of their understanding of their society. It is also a strategy which will assist in maintaining the rich indigenous cultures of this nation and the identity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister believes Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies will lay one of the foundations for the development of Australian society in the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is encouraging to know that there has been some considerable advance made with the development and inclusion of Aboriginal studies in the curriculum of some tertiary institutions and education systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year the Minister announced elements of the Reconciliation and Schooling Strategy&mdash;a way of putting together some existing curriculum development work, and providing new elements and a new focus for this work. Work so far has included:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies curriculum project, contributing to the national collaborative curriculum exercise, and preparing a publication as a guide to Australian schools;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a review and survey of best practice in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander schooling, leading to a video and teaching notes;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the teacher inservice modular education system, designed to increase the quality of inservice training of teachers of Aboriginal studies and of Aboriginal students;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a comparable exercise for pre-service training of teachers;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the sister schools scheme, which I launched recently, to encourage contact between students of predominantly non-Aboriginal schools with students in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander schools. The reception to this scheme has been most encouraging, and I am confident that with further promotional activity at the beginning of the next school year, there will be a large number of schools participating in 1993;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the local history project, which involves a video and kit to encourage and help Aboriginal school communities to research and prepare local histories for use in the Aboriginal studies curriculum of their schools; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">initial steps to research and develop a strategy to improve education and training for Aboriginal prisoners and ex-offenders, amongst the most educationally disadvantaged in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the third priority of the Commonwealth for the Second AEP triennium, the Minister is confident that this work will be advanced by education providers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Definitely, much more needs to be done to ensure the continuation of efforts towards achieving our set goals. As the next AEP triennium approaches, the Minister is looking forward to hearing about different strategies to address the vital national issue of ensuring that Aboriginal students are just as well taught, well educated, highly motivated and successful as any other Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1992</EMPHASIS> provides for the continuation of Commonwealth funding of the Aboriginal Education Strategic Initiatives Program addressing the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy for the years 1993-1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Bill is to appropriate funds to enable the Commonwealth to continue to enter into bilateral education agreements with State and Territory governments, non government school systems, Aboriginal education institutions and Aboriginal Education Consultative bodies for the provision of Aboriginal education initiatives consistent with the AEP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has allocated a total of $241 million as its commitment to the National Policy over the next 3 years 1993-1995. This amount includes $17.3 million in response to the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in relation to additional preschool places and additional Aboriginal education workers and an amount of $16.8 million has been included for Aboriginal Languages and literacy initiatives. The Bill provides for the appropriation of $76.9 million in 1993, $81.3 million in 1994 and $83.1 million in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill underpins one of the continuing successful reforms of the Federal Labor Government. This Bill is about social justice and is about greater accountability in government expenditure.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for lunch at 12.45 p.m., we were considering the Appropriation Bills. I had made a number of points about this Government's Budget for 1992-93. In particular, I had commented that this was the fifth attempt in 18 months by this Government to try to fix the economic problems that it had created with the recession that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said we have to have. In the 1992-93 Budget the Government is yet again tinkering at the edges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before lunch I was focusing on a number of areas which I considered of importance in budgetary policy. I was comparing what a Liberal government would do under Fightback with what this Labor Government has done, particularly within the areas of employment and training. I was making the point that Donald Horne, one of the most respected commentators on Australian society, warned that this country would have to be prepared; that it could not depend on its luck; that in particular it could not depend on resources booms to come along and save it; that there would come a time when Australians would have to rely on their own merits; and that in particular we would have to get training and education programs under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Donald Horne warned that this would have to be done 10 years before the crunch point was reached. That crunch point has certainly been reached with the great recession that has been under way now for about 18 months. This Government has not done enough to help change the training systems that are needed to pull this country out of the mess that it is in. Horne warned about the day of reckoning. Over the last 10 years the Government has neglected the main area that he was warning us about&mdash;training, particularly technical training. It has neglected this area more than any other area in our whole education and training system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many ways, if it is not too late for us to be pulled out of this problem, it will be a very long time before that will happen. The Government has to make some very hard decisions in the area of vocational training. The Government has to set up training programs. But it has not created the circumstances under which people can find jobs when those training programs have finished. So we have two problems: not only do we have inadequate training programs but also we do not have jobs for young people when those training programs are finished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some months ago I had discussions with the migrant community in Wollongong, which is Australia's seventh largest city. They told me about the problems they were facing in the recession and of the help available to them. The only help the Government has provided is endless training programs that are not properly linked to jobs. They complete training, but the economy of Wollongong is in such a state of disaster that they are unable to find any work; they retrain, but still they are unable to find work; so they retrain again, and so it continues. The result is that Wollongong has the best educated dole queue in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting people into innumerable training schemes does not solve the problem, it merely hides it, and it delays the inevitable. This Budget is not about job creation, it is about vote creation. Under Fightback, by contrast, the coalition will commit $945m over the next triennium to expand vocational education and training. The coalition will also encourage the commitment of additional private resources over and above those likely to be committed under the present Government's policies through substantial increases in the independence of schools, colleges of TAFE, private providers and universities to offer an expanded range of vocational education courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Levels of participation and attainment in training must, with these programs, be raised to best international standard. The Liberal and National parties will promote an open and flexible training market and facilitate better links between schools, training institutions and the workplace. In addition to the extra funding the coalition will provide, we are committed to establishing a framework for the assessment of key competencies for work force participation. We will support national competency-based training and a national system of training certification and we will support approved cross-accreditation between schooling, training and higher education. This vocational training initiative, in combination with the rest of the Fightback reform package, is the foundation for sustainable job growth within a dynamic and expanding economy. By contrast, the ALP Government's last Budget attempted to hide the unemployment problem and has not addressed the real issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, in other vital areas of economic reform the ALP Government has not had the guts to make the changes that are so desperately needed. For example, in the area of taxation reform, we recall that policy reforming joke known as the Tax Summit in 1985, where the Government wimped out yet again. The Prime Minister, then the Treasurer, a keen advocate of the GST, could not get his own way. On 13 June 1985, at a lunch in Adelaide, Mr Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tax reform has been in the nation's too hard basket for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet it is unquestionably the structure of the tax system, more than any other feature of public policy, which influences the efficiency of economic activity, and decisions to invest, to save and to work.</PARA>
<PARA>Only a week earlier, at the National Press Club, Mr Keating espoused the benefits of a broad based consumption tax, saying that it would allow a more rational indirect tax system to replace the anomaly ridden tax system. It is interesting to note that that is still in place, it is still pulling in $9 1/2 billion every year, and people do not even realise that the tax is there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in 1985, Mr Keating said that his GST proposal would provide a major reduction in personal income tax, and he noted that it would generate tax from those who continued to evade or avoid income tax. In that same speech the current Prime Minister said in relation to a broad based consumption tax:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For too long the politically unpalatable decisions have been put off in this country because our politicians have not had the strength of purpose to tackle the hard issues.</PARA>
<PARA>This shows that not only did he not have the guts to follow through with taxation reform, but he is also now taking a very hypocritical position by opposing it. In addition, this ALP Government has not had the strength of character to introduce the labour market reforms that are obviously so necessary. Indeed, today we heard Senator Cook claim all the enterprise bargaining agreements that he had under his belt. He listed them one by one. I think <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will show that the enterprise bargaining agreements the Minister for Industrial Relations alluded to could be counted on the fingers of both hands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The harsh reality is that the vast majority of workers in this country are still under a highly centralised and regulated system. Only a very small number of workers have got out from under the yoke of the IR club that runs industrial relations in this country. Senator Cook is starting to head in the right direction, but the progress is at a snail's pace. That pace has to accelerate very rapidly for this country to revive and to grow again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Union involvement in the agreements that have been made so far illustrates the problem. I refer in particular to the waterside workers agreements and the huge rip-off of taxpayers' money involved. I think it was Senator Cook again who claimed here how little trouble the Government had had with the waterfront reform program. He said that they had the agreements and that the manning levels had dropped. Why would the Government not get agreements, with the huge pay-offs being made to waterside workers? Why would the waterside workers complain? Why would they strike? The average redundancy payment is $100,000 per wharfie; I would not expect any strikes on that basis. That has actually cost the taxpayer $430m. These costs have been shared not only by the taxpayer but also by the shipping companies, and one of the effects of that is to stop the drop in the price of shipping in this country and in the shipping rates. Of course, the net effect is to keep shipping charges up and to keep Australia uncompetitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For 10 years in this country the ALP has had its hands on the levers of economic power to implement the necessary structural reforms, but it has run away from the tough decisions at every opportunity or been forced to back down by the trade union movement, which holds the whip hand over this Government, and this Budget is no exception. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the bottom line for all of this? What has this Labor Government and the policies of financial mismanagement it has pursued over the past 10 years created? It has created a situation where we are looking at leaving our children a lower standard of living than that which we have enjoyed, and that is a disgrace after 10 years of rule by any government. Labor policies have clearly failed, and a completely different approach to the key policy areas needs to be taken. This will start next year under Dr Hewson's visionary 20-point Fightback plan. The Fightback approach to this Budget will mean more jobs and fewer taxes. Under Fightback, the coalition will lift the burdens placed on individuals and businesses and it will get this country moving again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will reduce costs for business, we will create a more competitive environment, we will give back to individuals their freedom of choice, and we will give back to individuals the incentive to strive to achieve their potential. Fightback addresses those issues, and it is the coalition's Fightback budget that is really needed for the future of this country&mdash;not this Budget, which is the ALP Government's fifth pathetic attempt to get this country out of the great recession that our Prime Minister, Paul Keating, said we had to have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 1992-93 Budget, the first under the leadership of Paul Keating, is a Budget with an emphasis on jobs. Jobs provide the basis for security, quality of life and personal dignity. Jobs are not just about statistics. Employment figures do not simply show us how good or how poorly the economy is performing. Employment is about people&mdash;about men and women who want to provide a quality of life for their families, some of whom are unable to. This Government has a responsibility to provide for those without jobs, not just because increased employment is good for the economy and good for government revenue but because it creates the opportunity for a healthy and happy society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One stark aspect of the recession is the increase in crimes of theft and domestic violence. People are hurting, but before any government can help its people, it has to care. This Government stands on its record&mdash;from Medicare to family assistance&mdash;as a government that sees the people of Australia as people and not as fodder for a discredited doctrinaire economic approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In line with this, the Government reaffirms its commitment to a goal of full employment. The coalition has already indicated that it wants to drop the Government's commitment to full employment by removing this objective from the charter of the Reserve Bank. Dr Hewson may bleat that he still believes in full employment, but one does not leave the barn door open and at the same time insist that one does not want the horse to bolt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without that commitment or objective, no government can expect people to believe it is serious about reducing the level of unemployment. It is effective work that creates wealth and value. Speculative frenzies such as the recent currency crisis in Europe, which saw billions of dollars disappear overnight, show how vulnerable we are all to economic terrorists who have no allegiance to any country or any government. This Government has put its faith in the constructive and effective labour of its people. We have not succeeded as well as we would like, but as the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, said, `Regret, without action, has a hollow ring to it'. That is why this Government has a plan of action&mdash;a package aimed at providing a stimulus for job growth in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This package involves a number of measures, including a new local capital works program covering regions hardest hit by unemployment. This will involve spending $345m in the next two years, of which Queensland will receive $48m. The package will also include more money for roads and schools; $188m for urban development and public housing; and big increases in the Jobstart and Jobskills programs. Of course, job growth cannot rely solely on a strong public works program; it also relies on a number of indirect measures which allow Australian industries to also grow and develop and in turn provide more job opportunities for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Chairman of the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, I have a strong commitment to rural industries and regional Australia. I am pleased, as will be my fellow members of the Rural and Regional Affairs Committee, to see a number of initiatives in this Budget which greatly assist farmers and others. The measures include an increase of $157m to $166m in Commonwealth funding for the rural adjustment scheme. This includes restructuring of the rural adjustment scheme with the cooperation of the State governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other measures include the establishment of a national drought policy, which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Simon Crean, announced shortly after the Budget details were released. They also provide for an additional $31m for the debt reconstruction with interest subsidy scheme; $6m for the continuation of the crop planting scheme, as announced in the One Nation package; an additional $3m for the primary industries and marketing skills program and for improved access to education, training and services in rural areas; an additional $1.4m for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities for the development of rural resources; $8m for a rural incentives program to encourage general practitioners to relocate to rural areas; and last, but by no means least, a 25 per cent increase in the base component of the income tax remote area zone rebate, effective from 1 January 1993, which will benefit some 44,000 people living in remote regions of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Chairman of the Rural and Regional Affairs Standing Committee, I am especially pleased and proud to see the release of a national drought policy. People on both sides of politics have certainly looked for that for some time. People in the industry themselves, through the use of examination of the current position and recommendations of a drought policy review committee, have also suggested this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Rural and Regional Affairs Standing Committee released its final report on a national drought policy, appropriate government responses to the recommendations of the drought policy review task force were made in July this year, and a number of recommendations have been addressed in this Budget. The national drought policy is an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States. It is based on principles of sustainable development, risk management, productivity growth and structural adjustment in the farm sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this policy drought is no longer seen as a national disaster&mdash;something sudden, unexpected and out of the ordinary&mdash;but as one of the risks that farmers will normally contend with during their working lives. Drought will affect a farm's efficiency and profitability, as will man-made problems such as falling world commodity prices and general changes in consumer demand or consumer preferences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this does not mean that there will not be droughts for which farmers cannot plan and prepare. I believe that any government should have a responsibility to assist in those circumstances beyond the current and continuing policy of the Government in relation to assisting the rural area. Also, the fact that it is no longer seen in the disaster area does not mean that it should not also attract assistance of a similar sort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of a national drought policy is to reduce the effect of drought as one of the several sources of uncertainty affecting farm businesses in Australia. The specific objectives of the national drought policy are to encourage primary producers and other sections of rural Australia to adopt self-reliant approaches to managing for climatic variability; and to maintain and protect Australia's agricultural environmental resource base during periods of extreme climatic stress. I am pleased to have had this aspect brought to my notice. Many farmers are very enlightened in this regard and clearly see their land as something to be husbanded, something that they will be on for the rest of their lives and something to leave to their families and the nation. This is to be contrasted with the attitude of some people who in the past have been very short-sighted and who have abused the land rather than farmed it skilfully and thoughtfully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another objective of the national drought policy is to ensure early recovery of agricultural and rural industries consistent with long term sustainable levels. Under the national drought policy farmers will have to assume greater responsibility for managing the risks arising from drought conditions. This principle is an important one. Farmers are a fiercely independent group who, above all, want to maintain control of their own farms and businesses and not have to come to government for handouts and other financial assistance time and time again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we, as the Government, can provide a range of measures that allow the farmer maximum control of his or her farm, which often has been worked by the same family for many years, we will achieve something that no amount of money can buy. I refer to dignity and self-respect, a feeling of worth and accomplishment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recession and drought bring more than economic hardship to rural communities because farmers take so much pride and honour in their work and their contribution to the Australian economy and society. Their failure hurts them very deeply. We have seen many people forced off their farms who see themselves as failures. But drought is not their fault, recession is not their fault and world trade subsidies are not their fault either. The goal of the national drought policy is to show farmers and other primary producers how to beat the odds and make what is one of the world's most efficient and productive industries viable in the long term through any sort of adversity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national drought policy consists of a number of components which provide a full package of assistance to primary producers. They include a new rural adjustment scheme based on sustainable long term profitability and provide assistance in times of exceptional downturn, including not only drought but also falling commodity prices, disease outbreaks and other situations beyond the farmers' control. They also include an improved income equalisation deposits scheme, including a farm management bond. This scheme will assist farmers to build financial reserves which will be available to them during the period of drought or other downturn in income. It will provide $700,000 per year for three years for research and development into drought preparedness, including climate prediction and pest and weed control; $11.5m in the next four years for education and training to assist farmers in property management planning, risk assessment, drought management and for the implementation of associated land care measures. One and a half million dollars will be spent to ensure that farmers are aware of the national drought policy and its advantages, including how to prepare for and manage during drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also under legislation to be administered by the Department of Social Security, the Commonwealth will provide farm household support for farmers who are in extreme financial hardship. Drought relief in the form of interest subsidies or farm household support meet the immediate needs of rural producers, but other measures&mdash;such as a renewed commitment to research and development on drought preparedness&mdash;should not be underestimated for the potential contribution they can make to improving the long term profitability of the farming sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth will develop an integrated national grant research and development program in collaboration with the States and rural research and development corporations. Over $2m will be contributed by the Commonwealth in the next three years with additional funding provided by private companies through collaborative research agreements. Coordinated drought research is essential, and it is hoped that this research will cover a wide range of issues including climate predictions; technical, biological and financial information; control strategies for weeds and pests; the needs of rural communities and farm families in times of stress; and on-farm and off-farm investment strategies for farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national drought policy will succeed with the understanding and cooperation of the rural community it is designed to help. To ensure the best results, the Government will complement its ongoing education and training programs with a new awareness campaign aimed at farmers, farm organisations, associated industry groups, accountants, advisers, bankers and other financial institutions, Landcare groups and others. This cooperative approach is capable of achieving the best results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to industrial relations. In the program performance statements for the Industrial Relations portfolio the following comment is made in regard to subprogram 1.1:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sub-program will present to the AIRC review of the operation of the October 1991 National Wage Case decision the Commonwealth's views on the implications of the legislative amendments for the AIRC's wage fixing principles.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sub-program will play an enhanced role in ensuring that social justice considerations are accepted as a key element in industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA>We heard a lot from the Opposition about the idea of freeing up the labour market absolutely, deregulating it and allowing for and encouraging individual negotiations between employer and employee. This, of course, creates a totally uneven and unfair negotiating situation with the power lying totally with the employer because of his resources, experience and capacity to call on other people with skills in that area. We, as a government, suggest that we should continue to have strong trade unions which negotiate on behalf of workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as our progress in the area of negotiated enterprise agreements is concerned, it is true that we have not gone as quickly as we would have liked.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention two particular situations which show successful achievement. We are normally told by people in the Opposition about all the failures.

Moore said the Geelong plant had already improved its quality in other areas, particularly the plastics section where wastage was now down to almost zero, but he said quality control was a constant process.</PARA>
<PARA>This shows a clear understanding that the workers on the job are aware of the importance of quality control as well as the matter of productivity levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kim Elliott, who is a Victorian organiser for the Metals and Engineering Workers Union, said that experience with the Japanese had shown that while ever they were getting the quality they required they would support Australian companies and continue to order.

<PARA>They are not airy-fairy ideas. That is a description of what actually happened in those particular areas of work. We have seen a lot of documentation put forward by the Opposition, particularly the Jobsback program, about the need to free up the right of individual workers to negotiate with employers. But the fact is that, no matter how well an employer and a labour union or employees in a workshop may get on, there is always a clear difference of interest between those two parties. If they both contribute and create wealth in their particular enterprise, each of them could well honestly believe that their share of the wealth should be larger. There is, therefore, a position of negotiation. It can be one where somebody wants a greater share of the same cake or it can be one where they cooperate and create a bigger cake with the share of each then in totality being greater; so there is a mutual benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But no matter what happens there is that clear difference of interest between labour and capital. Anybody who suggests otherwise shows that he or she is ignorant, stupid or absolutely dishonest. So there will always be a need for trade unions that are run democratically&mdash;that operate from the bottom up, with the members indicating what they want to be done&mdash;and that have good leadership which thinks laterally and puts forward new ideas and makes suggestions as to the direction in which the organisation should go, and which has an appreciation of the interests of the nation, or society, while at the same time realising that its first commitment is to its members. That does not mean for one moment that the interests of the members of that organisation do not and cannot coincide with the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the Budget is a good one. I realise that everyone will not be happy with the amount of expenditure in every area, but that is not possible if you have limited capacity.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the previous speaker, I do not agree it is a good Budget. I am astonished that the Government can spend so much money it does not have, pat itself on the back and say it is a good Budget. These are really extraordinary times. The Australian economy is in terrible condition. We have low commodity prices for our exports in primary products; we have record bankruptcies; we have lack of profitability in industry; we have record crime and social instability within the country to a degree that none of us have ever seen before in our lifetimes; and on top of it all we have record unemployment figures. The Australian community, in my lifetime, has never been in a worse condition; yet we have this sort of Budget put before us to cope with what I believe are quite exceptional circumstances requiring urgent redress. As a nation, we have an acute balance of payments problem which has all the appearance of being accepted by the Government as something that is permanent and immutable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have record overseas debt. Within the 10 years of this Government, we have seen the debt position of Australia go from $30 billion to somewhere in excess of $150,000m. Added to that, we now have a collapsing economy where in the last few months the Australian dollar has decreased about 9.6 per cent against the US dollar, which of course has had a bad run itself. Every cent we take off the dollar makes that $150,000m we owe harder to pay because the currency is debased. We have to pay back that debt, and before we pay it back we have to pay interest on it. The sad thing is that nothing in the Bills that are before us this afternoon produces any circumstances that will change the affairs of the state of Australia at the present time. I think that is an enormous price for the Australian people to pay for this Government. </PARA>

We need to change the way we do things in this country and we need to change them quickly; but change is impossible to the monolithic Labor Government. What we need is a government that provides leadership for the nation and a leadership which unifies this country of Australia towards national goals, common goals, that all people can believe in and work for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The leadership ought to inspire people to make sacrifices and work hard so that as a nation and as a community we derive the benefit from those sacrifices and the efforts we have now to make to an extraordinary degree to recover from the incompetence that has been foisted upon us. That requires the Government to develop different community attitudes; to develop a new vision in the community; to get some self-discipline, a willingness to work hard and to save; and to pursue quality in manufacturing the way the previous speaker was talking about so that Australian industry produces goods that the Australian community can support by buying them for their quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get back to rising standards of living and get away from the dreadful poverty that now faces so many sections of the Australian community. What I am asking for really is a return to those values that made Australia great in previous times: the willingness to work hard; the ability to hold on to the rewards from that hard work; some incentive for effort; and the ability to save and look ahead, not live for the moment or live for the next Commonwealth cheque which has been the legacy of the Labor administration and the Labor philosophy. Sadly, nothing in the Bills that are before us this afternoon will change the circumstances of Australia one iota. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to take very long this afternoon because it is the wish that we get through the second reading stage of the Appropriation Bills by 7.30 tonight. I just want to make a couple of points in the Appropriation Bills about the Defence Department. Before I do that, I would like to pay tribute to the retiring Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Funnell, who is the latest of a line of quite outstanding officers who have been Chief of the Air Staff in my time in this Parliament&mdash;Air Marshal McNamara, Air Marshal David Evans and Air Marshal Jake Newham. I wish the retiring CAS, Air Marshal Funnell, well in his retirement. I am confident he will make a significant contribution to Australian public life in the many years he has left to him in his retirement. I do not wish to comment on his career and his achievements except to draw attention to what I regard as one of his best achievements, and that is the setting up of the Air Power Studies Centre in the RAAF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A successful armed service requires many attributes, including a well-developed sense of discipline and the ability to cope with great adversity and danger so that overwhelming physical force can be applied to achieve victory. I have a great and unbounded admiration, as everyone in this chamber would know, for the three services that comprise the Australian Defence Force. I have also had a lifelong concern about the academic component of the Australian Defence Force which I do not think has been as strong as it could have been, and certainly it is not as strong as it needs to be for the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am talking about here is a little difficult to define. I am certainly not saying that the educational qualifications of the Australian officer corps in all three services are not first class; they are first class, they are world class. The professional training we give our officers is excellent. I am certainly not saying that there are no intelligent people in the defence forces. There have been and are some very highly intelligent people. What I am trying to express is a need for more scholarship in military affairs. Australia, for example, has never produced a Captain Liddell Hart who had such a seminal influence on warfare not only for the British defence forces but also for armies around the world in the period between the First and Second World War; or a character such as Count von Clausewitz of the German forces in the last century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential that this academic component is developed within the Australian armed services. It is understandable, in a way, that all three services, which are concerned with fighting, do not think terribly much about what has to be done in an abstract or alternative way. The lessons that the defence forces apply in their training are lessons that have been bought at the ultimate price in the cost of human lives, and they are quite naturally very reluctant to accept deviation from that. But we are in very different circumstances to those in which we have been for the rest of this century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all conditioned to think in terms of global war. We had World War I and we had World War II, and in both cases there tended to be a major polarisation of the world into two camps. After 1945, the end of the Second World War, up to about two years ago, we had the Cold War which again polarised the world into two camps&mdash;the Western liberal democracies and the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would argue that those days are gone&mdash;they are gone for the rest of our lives. Future military conflicts will not be on a global scale but on a regional scale. While it is important that Australia maintains its alliances&mdash;namely, ANZUS and the Five Power Defence Agreement, which is becoming increasingly important as the countries with which we are allied grow and develop in South East Asia&mdash;we do have to look to the situation where we will be involved, regrettably, in military operations on our own in a regional context. Despite our best diplomatic efforts, we know from history that this will happen. I hope sincerely that those incidents are few and far between and that we can avoid them, but our defence planning must be based on the proposition that, henceforth, we will really have to look after our own affairs.  <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also argue that, unlike the First World War and the Second World War, there will not be a formal declaration of war; things will probably erupt with little or no warning. Unlike the Second World War, which was fought to a point of unconditional surrender by the Allies against the Axis powers, future conflicts will have quite limited objectives. They may be territorial, they might be trade, but they will be quite finite in their objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Future military conflicts will be regional; they will be small; they will come with little warning; they will be intense, in time and possibly space; and they will be finite. That means that we have to have a higher degree of readiness, a higher sustainability and a high degree of professionalism in the defence forces. All of these factors have to be developed in an environment where there is no clear threat. Therefore, it is difficult to focus public attention and public resources into developing a suitable defence force. We need a balanced, flexible defence force equipped with contemporary military skills with a judicious blend of both high and low technologies. The government of the day needs to have a range of options to respond to any situation. Of course, we do not currently have any of these things in the Australian Defence Force. No-one in this Parliament is thinking or talking about the need to move in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the academic component of defence, I would argue that there is now a very real need to have people who are trained in the profession of arms thinking about the future directions that the defence forces of Australia should take. Certainly, I do not want to see the Australian Defence Force composed of or run by obscure academic thinkers. But in the future we are going to be critically dependent on the intellectual input that we put into our defence forces. They are going to be small and we are going to be dependent on them when the time comes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Air Marshall Funnell has made an important contribution to Australia's defence by setting up the Air Power Studies Centre. Similar bodies have been set up subsequently in the Army and the Navy. The Air Force has been very careful in selecting the personnel to go into that body. It has some very able people; some very able thinkers. It may be argued that it is a little easier for this to be done in the Air Force than in the other two services because the Air Force, by its very nature, is a more highly developed service technically. There is probably more diversity of intellectual effort in the Air Force than in the other two services&mdash;I say that carefully and with the greatest respect to the other two services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to have these academic cells within all three services. As someone who has been involved in academia, I issue a caveat to that. Senior personnel in the Australian defence forces have to recognise that these bodies must have academic freedom; they cannot be controlled with respect to their output. The personnel who are selected to serve in these units should not only be officers of great professional experience and competence but also they should have first class intellectual capabilities and be capable of original intellectual thought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a body like this is set up, academic freedom has to be granted. One cannot guide or direct what the output of that thinking should be. One can certainly dictate the subject in which the thinking is done, but one cannot attempt to dictate the output. One just has to stand back and take what comes out. To me that has been the great legacy of Air Marshall Funnell. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One point that I should have mentioned earlier is that the creation of these cells is not of benefit solely to the Air Force, the Army or the Navy on a single service basis. The creation of these cells within all three services does a great deal to develop a common bond. It helps form the three services into a composite Australian defence force for use by the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will briefly touch on the mine warfare element that appeared in the Defence estimates. The history of mine warfare in Australia in the last 20 years has not been one of achievement; it has not been a history in which we can take much pride. The Navy set out to address the shortages in mine warfare with the minehunter inshore program. Unlike most people, I give the Navy unbounded praise for what it did there. It set out to seek an innovative solution to what was potentially a very expensive problem. It embarked on the design of a new type of platform&mdash;a catamaran hull&mdash;for operations in the inshore areas of Australia and equipped it with a certain sonar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Full marks to the Navy for having the originality and the courage to back its ideas. But it did the wrong thing when it found that this was not working. No-one had the courage to say out loud, `Hey, we have reached a dead end here; we need to go back and try something else'. The program dragged on and on for years and years. The true figure of expenditure for the minehunter inshore program probably will not ever be known, but it is well in excess of $120m. I think Navy or Defence admit to an expenditure of about $85m or $90m, and it is certainly a great deal more than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, we still have this requirement for minehunters. The program has now been renamed the minehunter coastal program and the Navy is going to go for a larger ship. In the last 12 months the Department of Defence sent a team around the world to look at a number of selected designs. My objection to that is that there is now a degree of inflexibility in Navy's thinking, in so far as the selection team will consider only ships that have been built for other navies around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need a minehunter that we can buy as cheaply as possible, provided it will do the job that we need it to do. Basically, we need a hull that is going to survive for 30 years with minimal maintenance, and we need a good sonar. We certainly need characteristics like the magnetic and acoustic signatures to be minimal so that mines are not detonated. We certainly need good shock resistance so that mines that are detonated accidentally do not kill the crew or destroy the hull. Those are the requirements. We certainly do not need a gold-plated design for a ship which cannot be used for any other purpose but hunting mines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the ships that the Navy has can be used for a number of functions. They have patrol functions and even logistic functions. They can carry people or freight in an emergency. A minehunter really cannot do anything else but hunt mines, so it is going to spend its 30 years tied up at the wharf when it is not on exercises. If we look at recent history around the world, we find that most of these minehunter programs have been extremely expensive. The USN embarked on a program which saw a proposed design move from about 450 tonnes up to 900 tonnes at huge cost. I think the program still has not been completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day there is no difference whether the RAN buys a gold-plated minehunter of its own or whether it buys a gold-plated minehunter that was designed and built for some other navy. We do not want to be involved in excessive cost. The figures that are officially put forward for this program for six ships are around $600m to $800m. Unofficially in the defence community in the city of Canberra, the figure that is commonly cited is $1 billion for those six minehunters. I think the $600m figure is way out of line. I think we could be looking at a cost that is about half the projected figure of $600m for those six minehunters, provided Defence was prepared to use a bit of initiative and originality in the design. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not see why, for example, we could not use a wooden hull. There are many successful wooden hull designs around that are in that 350- to 400-tonne category. Wood does survive. It lasts very well. We would certainly have to design to provide a low magnetic and acoustic signature and shock resistance, but there is nothing difficult about that. Those technologies are known. I might comment on the Collins submarines. The original Swedish design that we accepted as the basis for building the Collins submarines which are at present under construction in South Australia was very deficient in some areas, particularly on the acoustic and magnetic signature and all those things that I am talking about. Yet the RAN was able to build that technology into the design. I am quite confident that when those submarines are built they will be world leaders with respect to those attributes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I am saying is that that technology can be applied and there is no big deal in it. I would like to see the inflexibility with respect to built designs waived and the possibility of some locally designed minehunter coastal developed. There is not only a market within Australia for this; there is also a big regional market if we can come up with something that would cost in the order of $60m to $70m a ship, which I think is quite an attainable figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing I want to talk about is the recent announcement by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) of the acquisition of some more F111s for the RAAF. I support the Government very much on this. I think it is one of the most enlightened moves it has made in its time in government in relation to defence. I have been quite surprised at the protest movement about it, both within Australia and outside Australia. The protest within Australia is basically from people who do not understand what they are saying, but to have protest from outside Australia is a different matter again. The defence of Australia and what we do is primarily a matter for the Australian Government and the Australian people. We do not have to ask approval from any other country before we develop any capabilities in the defence direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is common sense that one does not upset one's neighbours by acquiring new capabilities and all the rest of it without telling them in advance. But the acquisition of a few more F111s in no way alters the basic capabilities of the Australian Defence Force. I find it surprising that there should be comment from overseas about the acquisition of these aircraft. After all, Australia never protested when the Indonesians announced a few months ago that they were going to buy 14 or 24 more war ships, including a number of amphibious ships, which, if Australia were hypersensitive, it could have objected to. But there was not a word about it here. It is recognised as a proper decision for the Indonesian Government to make. The same standards ought to be applied to the Australian purchase of the F111s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The F111 is a very useful component of the Australian defence forces. It provides an enormous deterrent capability. Even though the design goes back to the early 1960s, it is still a high performance aircraft. It is probably the fastest aircraft at low level in existence today. It is very hard to stop. When it is equipped with precision target acquisition equipment such as PAVETACK it is capable of using the range of precision munitions that we saw used in the Gulf. There are a number of applications that come from that technology that are useable in a passive surveillance role which are of great importance to the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real reason why the F111s were bought was that they became available at a relatively low cost. I know that the ADF has been aware of this for a long while, for a matter of years. I know that the Air Force has been looking at this. I have known for a long while that these aircraft would become available as they became surplus to the United States Air Force requirements. Basically, we have bought them for spare parts. It could be true that they could be used straightaway, but they could only be used with iron bombs and they could only be used in a relatively benign environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have at present is a restricted number of aircraft. We only had two squadrons. We have lost a number of them through attrition on training accidents. We will reach a point, if nothing is done, within the next few years, even with the best and most careful handling, where we will lose one or two more. Once the fleet size gets down to about 16 or 17 aircraft, then they become not worth while maintaining, given the great maintenance support that is required for them. Then we lose them from their inventory. Since the aircraft are not being made any more, the opportunity to acquire them for spares has to be taken when the opportunity presents. The Government has to be congratulated for its wisdom and flexibility in the way it moved to acquire those aircraft when the opportunity arose. </PARA>

Labor is going to spend some $1.2 billion creating jobs and opportunities right now through local works projects. The program is designed to kick-start local economies, give Australians jobs and create facilities for local communities in areas hardest hit by unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Budget provides more jobs in areas of high unemployment by allocating some $188m on housing and development projects, some $184m on building and upgrading schools, universities and science research facilities and $60m to fix dangerous black spots on local roads in order to cut road accidents. In addition, there is a very important allocation of $1.1 billion to create some 434,000 places in labour market programs, also to help unemployed Australians.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This afternoon, in speaking on the Budget, I want to talk particularly about the impact of alternative policies in Australia on the Australian tourism industry, a very important industry and one that is now contributing significantly and largely to Australia's balance of payments in a very positive way and creating many jobs in the Australian community. It is an industry with an enormous potential for growth and one that has grown significantly over the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I suspect that Liberal Party and National Party backbenchers opposite have been railroaded by the Liberal Party hierarchy over the impact of the goods and services tax on our vital tourism industry. I believe that must have happened, otherwise they would never have accepted a policy which would jeopardise an industry that is projected to create an additional 200,000 jobs over the rest of this decade. Those additional jobs in tourism are projected over the course of this decade with current policies in place and with no change in policy settings. But the Opposition is proposing a policy that would damage that industry enormously; it would hold back that industry's job growth and reduce its potential. Under the 15 per cent goods and services tax proposed by the Liberals, the employment prospects for tourism would be severely damaged. Tourism is one of Australia's fastest growing industries and now our single largest export earner.

It is estimated that by the year 2,000, some 6.4 million people will visit this country from overseas. I might point out that when the Liberal Party was last in Government in 1982, we did not have 2.3 million visitors from overseas; we had about 400,000 to 500,000. So there has been an undeniable improvement under this Government with a rapid growth in international tourism. We do not want to see that put in jeopardy. By the turn of the century we want to see that projection of 6.4 million visitors to Australia become a reality. We want to see its contribution to our balance of payments. It is forecast that by the year 2000 the balance of payments receipts from tourism will be $18,000m&mdash;a very significant contribution to the balance of payments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these circumstances I think we are entitled to ask why tourism has been singled out by the Opposition as the only export to have a goods and services tax applied to its foreign sales. Why is this? Why has the Opposition such crazy policies? Do those opposite recognise the enormous damage that their policies would inflict on Australia's flourishing tourism industry? I see Senator Herron is in the chamber. He comes from Queensland, a State which has benefited enormously from the tourism policies of this Government. Do those opposite, including Senator Herron, recognise the enormous damage to tourism that would be brought about by their policies? Of course they do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this damage is Dr Hewson's fixation on neatness. He wants one rate of tax&mdash;the same rate&mdash;on everything almost without exception. He wants a 15 per cent goods and services tax on virtually everything sold or produced in the Australian economy. So he is being very tough-minded about the tourism industry, possibly he is being tough on the honourable senators from Queensland on the conservative side of parliament, by proposing to tax this industry just like any other industry&mdash;yet I emphasise that it is a vital export earner for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last month an exemption from the goods and services tax was sought by the travel industry for tour packages bought overseas. But rather than concede the blatant anomaly in the Fightback package and act accordingly, Dr Hewson&mdash;that zealous, tidy-minded rationalist who wants one rate of tax on everything&mdash;chose instead to lecture the industry about vested interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the Opposition has got it wrong on tourism. All the gains that tourism has achieved under a decade of Federal Labor Government would be lost if the Opposition ever won office. Through vigorous promotion of Australia as an international tourist destination and in consultation with the industry, Labor has changed the face of tourism in this country. The reality is that Australia attracted about half a million visitors in 1982 under the Liberals, and a figure of 2.3 million visitors now under Labor. That is the achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1982 under the Liberals, the foreign exchange proceeds in current dollars from tourism were about $1.9 billion. In 1991 this figure increased to $7.3 billion. It is growing every year and is a major contribution. Tourism now accounts for about 10 per cent of Australia's total export earnings&mdash;more than the single earnings from wool, wheat, meat or iron ore. So tourism now is eclipsing those major commodities in its contribution to our balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the next eight years international tourism to Australia is forecast to more than double. But there is an important proviso there, and that is that tourism to Australia is forecast to double if current policies are kept in place&mdash;in other words, if it assumes the same policy settings. But if there is a goods and services tax, as I pointed out in my analysis, if the Opposition ever got into power and were able to levy such a tax on the tourism industry, that forecast growth in the industry would not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1981-82 under the Liberals, the total number of jobs in the tourism industry nationally was 337,000; this has now grown to 450,000 jobs. So there has been a net job creation of over 110,000 jobs in tourism since the Liberals were in office. It is forecast that over the rest of this decade, the remainder of this century, one in six of all new jobs in Australia&mdash;in other words, 16 to 17 per cent&mdash;will be in the tourism industry. But again this is assuming that policies are unchanged. It assumes that the same policy settings are in place as now apply. That would not be the case if there were imposed a crazy goods and services tax that discriminates against the Australian tourism industry, an industry which creates many thousands of jobs in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this Budget, for the first time there is a separate appropriation for tourism. This reflects the creation in December last year of a separate ministry of tourism and a new Department of Tourism. The $76m for the Australian Tourist Commission represents an increase of 18 per cent on last year and an eight-fold increase in funding since 1983. There is a $19m allocation for the Department of Tourism. An amount of $12m is provided for the refurbishment of the Indian Pacific train, which is a major vehicle for tourism in Australia. Over $6m is provided for the construction of cultural centres at both Uluru and Kakadu national parks. So there is a range of new initiatives in this Budget to keep on with the good work, to keep underpinning growth in Australian tourism. In addition, the Australian tourism industry stands to be a major beneficiary of the Government's $350m local capital works program in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, having set out those constructive initiatives in this Budget, we can draw a very clear comparison with the absolute nightmare that is in prospect for tourism in this country if the Opposition ever gets into power. A 15 per cent goods and services tax would be a death sentence for many businesses in the tourism industry. That is undeniable. In fact, I have not heard the Liberal Party tourism spokesman for some time now. I wonder whether the person who is supposed to be looking after the tourism industry for the Opposition still exists. That person probably knows the enormous damage&mdash;he comes from Senator Herron's home State of Queensland&mdash;a 15 per cent goods and services tax would do to the tourism industry in Australia in general and in Queensland in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that, under a goods and services tax, all travel products and services in Australia would carry a 15 per cent tax. That includes hotels, motels, domestic air fares, conference venues, restaurants, meals, takeaways, tourist attractions, souvenirs, et cetera. The list goes on and on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Liberal Party proposal, international air fares would be zero rated; that is, there would be no tax on the cost inputs into international air fares as well as the fares themselves, but domestic air fares would not be zero rated. Therefore, it would be relatively cheaper for Australians to holiday overseas; in other words, the price differential between domestic and international holidays would be shifted in favour of international holidays for Australians. So more Australians, under Liberal Party policies, with a GST, would be encouraged to holiday overseas than otherwise would be the case. More of them would have stayed at home in the absence of such a tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a double whammy in this proposal. It makes it more expensive for international visitors to come to Australia, but by the same token it makes it cheaper for Australians to holiday overseas. So there are two policy settings, if allowed to be put in place by the Liberals, which would act to worsen the situation for the Australian tourism industry and also act to harm the Australian balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A goods and services tax on the tourism industry would have the impact of throwing away the relative price advantage that Australia has at the moment. We do not have a goods and services tax on this industry. We would be throwing away a relative price advantage by making the industry more expensive for international visitors to Australia and making it cheaper, by zero rating international air fares, for Australians to holiday abroad instead of holidaying in our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A closer look at the implications of a 15 per cent GST on tourism shows the nightmare Australia's alternative government has in store for this country. We would have zero rated international air fares, which I have just referred to, and an incentive to holiday overseas. Giving an incentive to holiday overseas is bizarre logic. People would have zero rated flights to Hawaii, yet children's clothes would bear a 15 per cent goods and services tax. This is the sort of policy to which Senator Knowles, Senator Short, Senator Herron and all the others, including Senator Macdonald from Queensland, subscribe. The unfairness and the inequity are shown by the fact that international air fares on holidays in Hawaii would be zero rated&mdash;there would be a subsidy through the GST package&mdash;but Australian children's shoes would bear a 15 per cent goods and services tax. That is the unfairness, that is the inequity, of the policies being proposed by those opposite. That is Dr Hewson's tax mess. That is his package for Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback, Dr Hewson's package, would cost Australian domestic airlines more than $250m each year, even allowing for any tax offsets they might gain through the abolition of various taxes. That $250m would mean that domestic air fares would rise. My estimate is that domestic air fares might rise by about 10 per cent as a result of the impact of a goods and services tax on the domestic airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that many small businesses in the tourism sector would be badly hurt by a goods and services tax. That is undeniable. I remember hearing a speech in this chamber recently by Senator Knowles&mdash;who, coincidentally, happens to be present now&mdash;in which she said that firms would not be hurt because under the package there would be the abolition of payroll tax and therefore they would be advantaged. </PARA>

The reality is that only 15 per cent of the producers in the industry pay payroll tax now. How can 85 per cent of the sellers of services in the tourism sector be advantaged by the abolition of payroll tax? The State governments have thresholds for small businesses.

Those opposite claim, `We're going to put on a 15 per cent goods and services tax, but really, everyone in the industry will be advantaged because we're going to take off sales tax'. After labour costs, the biggest single item purchased by the Australian tourism sector is food. It is a hospitality industry. What is the story on food with regard to sales tax? Ninety-nine per cent of food items do not require the paying of sales tax. Senator Herron knows it; Senator Knowles knows it, although she parrots this twaddle about the abolition of sales tax helping the tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that 99 per cent of food items are now totally free from sales tax, so how is the abolition of sales tax going to give a kick-start or compensation to the tourism sector if and when a 15 per cent goods and services tax is levied on it? There is silence from the other side&mdash;deafening silence. There is no advantage, is there? There is no advantage in removing sales tax for members of the tourism industry. They are going to get hit in the neck by a 15 per cent goods and services tax; 85 per cent of them will not get any advantage from the abolition of payroll tax. As I have pointed out, after labour costs, food items are a major purchase cost for the tourism sector and a great majority of food items are not subject to sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an incredible situation. The Opposition comes in here and claims it will advantage the tourism industry by abolishing those two taxes. The Liberals are exposed yet again and they still go on with this absolute nonsense that price rises as a result of the GST would be kept to about 4 1/2 per cent on average throughout the Australian community. However, the two taxes that come into this calculation, sales tax and payroll tax, have only a minuscule effect on the Australian tourism sector at present. Clearly, the price rise for Australian tourism will not be 4 1/2 per cent, it will be significantly higher than that. The Liberals have been very misleading when talking about the cost impact on this very important industry&mdash;this large Australian earner of foreign exchange&mdash;as a result of a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had the opportunity of reading the report by Ernst &amp; Young, which is one of the big six accounting firms. I believe it provides consultants to the Liberal Party. These consultants actually looked into the impact of this goods and services tax on the hospitality industry and came up with some interesting price rises. I said that the Liberals are claiming that prices across the board will go up 4 1/2 per cent as a result of a goods and services tax, but the Ernst &amp; Young report said that the cost of accommodation would rise by 10 to 13 per cent. This is a double digit increase. The report said the cost of meals would rise by 12 to 13 per cent in the hospitality sector as a result of a goods and services tax and the price of alcohol would go up by 4 to 8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are some of the problems that will accompany a goods and services tax, if and when one is introduced in the Australian tourism industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I advise Senator Macdonald that the value added in the tourism industry is largely added by labour. That is substantially correct, because labour is the largest cost item in this very labour intensive tourism sector of the Australian economy. Therefore, if a goods and services tax is applied to a labour intensive industry, it is substantially a tax on labour. It is a labour value added tax. In other words, what the Liberals are proposing for labour intensive sectors of the Australian economy, including tourism, is a universal payroll tax. It is substantially a payroll tax on an industry with a high labour content. It is a very labour intensive industry. Basically, what the Opposition is talking about for the tourism sector, and all other labour intensive sectors of the Australian economy, is a universal payroll tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the present time we do not have a universal payroll tax in this country.

They have exemptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If and when the Liberals get into power&mdash;and it is becoming less and less likely&mdash;they are proposing to trade off a payroll tax, with thresholds and exemptions for small business, for a universal payroll tax for labour intensive industries. That analysis is correct. Basically, they are talking about getting rid of a partial, selective payroll tax which takes small business out of the net and bringing in a universal payroll tax. It is a labour intensive industry and labour is the major contributor to value added in that industry. </PARA>

I quote from a recent speech by a Government senator:</PARA>

It is often claimed by the Government&mdash;and also by the bureaucrats&mdash;that the proportion of our gross domestic product spent on health care in the last 16 years has been static. They claim it is a great victory&mdash;the same percentage of GDP has been spent. The Government does not tell us that we are now spending $740 a head below the average of the nine OECD nations. We have dropped behind the rest of the world, because not only have we had the recession that we did not have to have, but also we have screwed down expenditure on health care and it is making it impossible for people to be able to afford the freedom of choice to which they are entitled.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have another quote from that same speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One does not go to a private hospital to receive acute care for cardiac problems.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not go to a private hospital for intensive care.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me most is that there is no acknowledgment that one-third of hospital patients treated in Australia today are treated in private hospitals; there is no recognition of this whatsoever. Government policy has deliberately squeezed private patients out of these private hospitals. I draw the parallel that, if private hospitals closed tomorrow, it would be like closing private schools and putting all those school children into the public system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is the direction in which the Government is going. Why? Because that is its philosophy. It is philosophically driven to try to break the private insurance system of Australia without recognising the consequences of doing so. It is an absurdity. I believe that it does not recognise the direction in which it is heading because it is driven by a socialist philosophy. That philosophy has not changed. It was introduced with Medicare and we are witnessing the end point now, where the queues are getting longer and the public hospitals are screaming about their difficulty in being able to treat the number of patients who are presenting to them. There will be no end in sight unless there is a change of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only 41 per cent of Australians can now afford private health insurance care. In my own State of Queensland, it is down to 30 per cent.

So a certain percentage cannot be demarcated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government claims that its great Medicare system allows freedom of access. I would like it to tell that to the widow of a patient in Western Australia who was waiting for coronary bypass surgery. This man received publicity in Western Australia last week because he died while on the waiting list to have coronary bypass surgery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An extrapolation of that is the Canadian system, which this Government has so obviously followed. The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) acknowledged that this is occurring in Australia and that rationing is the only answer under Medicare. If we follow that system, as we are, we will reach the stage which has been reached in Canada, where the bureaucrats direct the cardiac surgeons as to which patients they should operate on. They have now reached the stage in Canada&mdash;and there was an article in the journal of the American Medical Association recently pointing this out&mdash;where rationing is starting to be applied to age groups and the clinical requirements of people. God help us if we ever get to that point in Australia. But if this present Government continues in power, that is the inevitable consequence of the policies that it is following. </PARA>

They are used on babies from about the age of six months to children up to six years of age. There is a 41 per cent tariff on those shoes, and they are not produced in Australia. Despite approaches from the Spina Bifida Association, which, as I say, have gone on for nine years, and the fact that these shoes are sold only through the Spina Bifida Association to children with spina bifida&mdash;they have no other purpose&mdash;this current Government imposes a 41 per cent tariff on those shoes, which are not produced in Australia. </PARA>

He referred to a Queensland University study showing that each $1m of manufacturing activity retained in Australia generated 29.5 person years of employment, $280,000 government revenue, $231,000 social security savings and $255,000 increased disposable income. It behoves us as a nation to look at both sides of the ledger.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn to what other countries are doing to protect their industries. An example of the readiness of other countries to protect their own is provided by the United States Industries Mobilisation Act which was used just three years ago to prohibit the importation of propeller shafts, even though substantial orders had already been placed with an Australian manufacturer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Thai Government ensures that Thai producers of sugar can recoup all their fixed costs from domestic sales, enabling them to savagely cut their prices on international markets, very effectively keeping out Australian sugar. Tariff and quota protection used by other car producing countries is substantial, starting with 10 per cent in the European Community, even though it has easy access to the world's largest market and long production runs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Korea has in place tariffs of 15 per cent and a total ban on the import of Japanese vehicles. Other countries provide incentives for the birth of new car industries by imposing prohibitive tariffs: Taiwan 42.5 per cent, the Philippines 50 per cent, Indonesia 100 per cent, and Thailand 200 per cent.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is now one of very few significant car manufacturing countries without quantitative restraints of some sort. The agricultural subsidies used by the United States and by the Europeans, notably France and Germany, are legendary at an average 40 per cent, with some States in the United States providing subsidies of up to 90 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The emerging data from the inquiry points to the rest of the world protecting their industries and their jobs while our Government, aided and abetted by Dr Hewson, is prepared to sacrifice our industries on the altar of discredited theories which are not of this world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion that we are prevented by GATT from taking action is simply not true. It is a furphy. Article 12 of GATT provides a specific exemption for countries with balance of payments difficulties and allows them to use protection measures to address their difficulties. Heaven knows, Australia has balance of payments difficulties. All it takes is some political will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Costs rise as tariffs fall. That is another finding which is very clearly emerging from the inquiry. When the Government embarked on its tariff cutting program Australian manufacturers were led to expect that micro-economic reform would reduce their costs. However, these cost reductions have simply not been delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure to pass on stevedoring cost savings to shippers is on the public record. However, it goes beyond the failure to deliver cost reductions. Industries are facing rising costs even as protection levels are reduced. The Chemical Industries Council testified at the inquiry that last year alone government charges had risen by 9.5 per cent. The two-way squeeze industries are facing is one more factor supporting a 12-month pause in tariff cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is another side to this situation. The most telling example of the pressure faced by Australian industries was the evidence about wage levels in China, which in 1991 provided 69 per cent of clothing and 55 per cent of footwear imports. This had risen from 53 per cent and 27 per cent respectively in 1988. The evidence was that the wage for a six-day week in a Chinese textile factory is the equivalent of $20. There was little evidence of work safety provisions which we take for granted, or the anti-pollution safeguards our manufacturers are correctly obliged to use and which they have to cover in their cost structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a choice as a community. We can try to compete with these exploitative practices and in the process negate the industrial, social and environmental standards we have. We would depress our standards in trying to compete. Very clearly, we cannot compete successfully. So we have a choice. Do we buy cheap products, do we allow imports to come in and do we throw our workers on the scrap heap and pay higher taxes to pay them unemployment benefits for doing nothing? Or do we continue to pay current prices for consumer goods, do we forgo cheaper prices for the goods we use and continue to have people in productive work?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is not a black and white choice. The evidence in this inquiry is not pointing to high protection as the saviour and the be-all and end-all of what needs to be done. What is being requested is a pause so that we stop destroying our industries, stand back, look at each industry sector and develop the measures that need to be taken not only to save industries and to continue putting people in jobs but also over time to increase the competitiveness which ultimately will lead to greater prosperity for all Australians. </PARA>

In all sincerity, it was full of unfactual rubbish. Senator Spindler somehow tried to say that because we remove a tariff from sugar&mdash;a tariff is to stop sugar coming into the country&mdash;it suddenly cuts our export values of sugar. Senator Spindler will have to tell me how that actually happens, bearing in mind that the tariff is to stop sugar coming into the country. He is telling me that that in some way affects the amount of money we get for sugar we sell overseas. It is absolutely incredible, particularly when 80 per cent of our sugar&mdash;Senator Spindler would not realise this&mdash;most of Queensland's sugar, is exported and is not therefore affected by a tariff on sugar coming into the country. Senator Spindler must understand why people are leaving his Party in droves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought I might start my contribution to the debate on the Appropriation Bills by quoting some comments by a prominent Australian politician. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are three main advantages of (consumption) tax:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, it will allow a more rational tax system than the current anomaly-ridden wholesale tax, which has multiple rates, numerous exemptions, and fails to tax the services sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, it will enable us to generate tax revenues to provide for a major reduction in the marginal rates of income tax. No other tax has the same potential for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, it generates tax from those who will continue to evade or avoid income tax. That provides a useful `net dividend' for distribution to the rest of the community.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'll be barracking for a broad based consumption tax.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask Senator Bolkus, who is in the chamber: who would he think that was? Would he think that was John Hewson, or perhaps Peter Reith? Those words were not theirs; they were the words of his leader&mdash;no-one else but Mr Paul Keating, the man who wanted the broad-based consumption tax. Senator Bolkus would have got that wrong, but those were the words of Mr Keating advocating a consumption tax, a GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I usually have a high regard for Senator Maguire. He usually talks a lot of sense, as is shown in the committees on which I have been involved with him. The absolute rubbish that he spoke in his contribution, particularly as it relates to the tourism industry, encouraged me to respond to him, even though I was not originally listed to speak in this debate. I point out for the benefit of Senator Maguire and for the benefit of those people who might be listening the enormous advantages that the Fightback package will bring to tourism. As a Queenslander, one who lives in the premier tourism area of Australia in the north of Queensland, I am very pleased that the Fightback package has given these sorts of benefits to the tourism industry. Time will prevent me from doing other than merely mentioning them very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourism industry will benefit from the abolition of seven existing taxes. The Federal Treasury&mdash;this is the Labor Government's Treasury&mdash;has estimated that over $1 billion of savings will be available for key sectors of the tourism industry through the abolition of indirect taxes. These savings include: $376m in air transport; $361m in entertainment; and $318m in restaurants, hotels and clubs. The abolition of the petrol tax for private users, totalling 19c a litre, a saving of $11 each time the average car is filled, will bring domestic travel back within the reach of ordinary Australians. Business users will save 26c a litre. In the tourism industry a major Queensland coach company would save almost $2m in fuel tax, $100,000 in sales tax on tyres and $125,000 for parts and maintenance. A Whitsunday air charter company near where I live would save $67,500 from its Avgas bill of $217,500. People will be able to afford to travel to tourism destinations in my area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The abolition of sales tax will see the hotel and motel industry free from the 20 per cent tax it currently pays on items ranging from soap and toilet paper to bar equipment, laundering equipment, glasses, crockery and bed linen. Personal income tax cuts in the range of $13 billion will put more money in the pockets of average Australians to spend on domestic travel, and they will do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are changes in the capital gains tax which will benefit tourism operators. The Jobsback package will be particularly beneficial to tourism. All GST on any business inputs into the tourism industry will be rebated in full, so tourist operators will not in any way be burdened by the GST but they will make enormous savings from the abolition of seven existing taxes. There are another two pages of benefits I could mention but time does not permit me to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last five minutes of my speech I want to respond to some equally silly comments made by one of the Labor Party senators, Senator West, earlier on in relation to local authorities. I do not know what Senator West's expertise is but it is quite obvious that she has no idea of how local authorities operate and how the Fightback package will impact upon them. She probably should have investigated just what taxes this current Government imposes upon local authorities. They pay enormous payroll tax in my State and in several other States of the nation. The petrol tax that all councils pay is an enormous impost on their operations, one which they pay purely in tax revenue to this Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the sales tax legislation is somewhere around the Parliament at the moment. In that legislation, this Government attempted for the first time to impose a sales tax on local authorities through the incidence of hiring. I might also say that, through this Government's recently announced initiatives, local authorities are going to benefit by having the fringe benefits taxes that they currently pay doubled. So that is what this Government thinks of local authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, our proposal to remove petrol tax, payroll tax and the training guarantee levy will have significantly beneficial impacts on local authorities. For example, the Labor controlled Townsville City Council will save some $307,580 from the abolition of fuel tax alone. It will also save $210,000 from the abolition of payroll tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our package is a very honest one. We acknowledge up front that our grants to State and Federal governments will be cut by 5 per cent. If that were done across the board for every council there would be a 5 per cent cut in their financial assistance grants. But, in the Townsville example that I am citing, while the reduction of 5 per cent in FAGs would be $160,000, the savings from fuel tax would be $307,000&mdash;almost double that&mdash;and the savings from payroll tax another would be another $210,000 on top. So the Townsville City Council, even allowing for a 5 per cent reduction in FAGs, would still be $357,000 better off under the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not take into account the particular savings that councils will make from the reduction in prices that their contractors will tender to them because of the abolition for contractors of wholesales sales tax, petrol tax, payroll tax, the training guarantee levy and the other taxes we propose removing, and the pegging of the superannuation guarantee levy. So there are enormous savings to every local authority around Australia, and Senator West obviously does not understand that. I pity her. She has to fight an election shortly. She simply does not understand that any GST that a local authority might pay on its business inputs will be refunded fully and immediately. I repeat that: fully and immediately refunded. So there will be no negative burden on local authorities from the GST. But local authorities will have enormous savings from the abolition of those taxes. I have given honourable senators the example of the Townsville City Council, but I could give the examples of the Burdekin shire, Pioneer shire, Flinders shire, Ballina City&mdash;any council the Government cares to name. I have figures from many councils. All of them will be better off in their operations as a result of the Fightback package, even allowing for the reduction in FAGs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot of scuttlebutt going around from some councils or local authorities that are controlled by the Labor Party. But one would expect that. It is the same thing Senator Maguire and Senator West did. People who know better simply and deliberately misinterpret and say things about our policies which are untrue and which they know to be untrue. The regret is&mdash;and it is a shame that the Labor Party descends to this type of activity&mdash;that the Labor members know them to be untrue but still go around saying them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that line, it is a real circus to read what the Brisbane City Council, controlled by the Labor Party, has said about the Fightback package. First of all, the Mayor, Alderman Soorley, decided that it was going to increase the costs of every Brisbane ratepayer by $211. He later changed that to $226; then he went up to $320. He then said that the cost of administration would be $700,000. Then he changed it back to $200,000. He has absolutely no idea. He simply puts forward what his Labor mates down here suggest to him might be a good selling point to try to scare people. But it will not work. He was forced to concede that the Brisbane City Council will save, from the abolition of the petrol tax and the payroll taxes, some $11.4m. He was forced to concede that, and that is fairly typical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our program acknowledges across the board that costs will increase by about 4.4 per cent. Obviously, Senator McMullan's lot did not believe that. He went out and got Treasury with all of its resources to check our figures. It came back and said, `Yes, the Liberals are wrong. It is not 4.4 per cent; it is only 3.6 per cent'&mdash;less than our calculations. So we acknowledge that the amount people spend per year will increase by about 4 per cent. But, to ensure that no Australian is in any way disadvantaged by the Fightback package, we will increase their take-home pay&mdash;put</PARA>
<PARA>money in their pockets from a number of very well thought out, well costed proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to mention all of them&mdash;just a couple. Firstly, the tax take for most working Australians will fall by 30 per cent. So a person on $20,000 a year will get $15.60 more in his or her pocket every week, and that is to cover for a 4 per cent, or a $13, $14 or $15, increase in the cost of living. In addition to that, someone with three kids will get an extra $30 a week from the family allowance, and every time they go to fill the family Holden with fuel they will save $10, $11 or $12 as well. So just in those three measures alone a family on $20,000 will be far better off under Fightback, even paying any additional costs that there might be from the introduction of the GST. So they will be better off by something in the range of $30 to $40 more in their pockets every week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To compensate pensioners for the 4 per cent increase in the cost of living, we will give them an 8 per cent increase. That is not bad deal for pensioners. Their costs increase by 4 per cent; they get 8 per cent more. So they are doing very well. If one goes through the whole range, one finds that all Australians are compensated under the Fightback package and, as a result of that package, they are far better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than a high taxing, high spending government that has created the recession we had to have and made almost two million&mdash;not one million&mdash;of our fellow Australians unable to find full time work, we have a vision, a plan, from the Liberal Party and National Party, and from John Hewson, to send Australia in the direction it has to go in this next decade. It is a plan to turn Australia around and to get it to the great heights that we know our country can reach. </PARA>

If we were going to expedite it on any day so that everybody got a chance to speak, many senators would have enjoyed today, being broadcast day.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reading speeches on the Appropriation Bills are always an opportunity for an important debate. Not every contribution made in the course of it is necessarily important, but it is an opportunity for people to speak about important issues and to range widely across matters of concern, because the Appropriations cover every area of government. A number of people have made substantial contributions. It is entirely inappropriate for me to pick out any of them. I might succumb to the temptation to respond slightly to Senator Macdonald, but it is not my intention to do that simply on the basis that he was coincidentally the person speaking when I came in and sat down. I thank honourable senators for their contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have in Australia today a very important debate about the nature of economic policy. Of course, there is a very dramatic contrast. The only point Senator Macdonald and I might agree on is that the contrast between the two propositions is very dramatic. We would probably agree upon a second point, and that is that six months before an election it is very welcome that both parties have their programs out before the people so that there can be an informed choice. It is the nature of democracy that informed choice enhances the democratic process and it is welcome that we have these comprehensive packages put forward so early. However strongly I might disagree with Fightback and its industrial relations counterpart, I welcome the fact that they are before the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to speak for long because others have expedited proceedings and foreshortened their contributions. I will not take up the time which they have been prepared to forgo. However, I think it is necessary to put on the record that these Appropriation Bills do in some way symbolise one part of the stark contrast between the Government and the Opposition because they set out a policy designed to give stimulus to the economy. One part of the contrast between Government and Opposition going into the next election is that we believe it is appropriate, at a time of concern that recovery from the recession is all too slow, for the Federal Government to be giving stimulus to the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the prevailing view now in almost every Western economy, given the election of Bill Clinton today as President-elect with a similar policy. Almost every Western economy&mdash;Japan, Germany, Australia and now the United States&mdash;has governments, or government elect in the case of the United States, committed to a policy of stimulus to assist in an all too slow recovery from the recession in our case and the lingering recession in other cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have from the Opposition a proposal to slash public spending in a way that would reduce economic growth and enhance inequity. I highlight the contrast in only one other way. I cannot resist elucidating something which Senator Macdonald said. He was very keen to quote the Treasury report which said that prices under Fightback would increase only by 3.9 per cent. But I did not hear him go on to refer to those other parts of that same document which said that, although it is true that on average prices will go up only that much because the prices of some luxuries will fall dramatically, the price of food will go up by 8.8 per cent, the price of clothing by more than 10 per cent and the price of electricity by approximately 10 per cent. The three basic necessities that every family has to buy will go up by more than twice the average. That is an example of how the inequity is generated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also exacerbated by the nature of the income tax cuts where the biggest increases in after tax earnings go to those on $75,000 a year, which seems to me not to be a definition of those in greatest need in our society. It may be a definition of the salary most commonly found in the Opposition party room, but it does not reflect where I think the burden of need most importantly lies. It is in some way a magic pudding approach. I am sure Senator Macdonald believes what he said, but to pretend we can make massive increases in the welfare of the already well off and that somehow everybody is going to be better off&mdash;that there is a magic pudding where you can give everybody a bit extra and nobody loses&mdash;is in fact a dangerous illusion, although I accept that the people saying it in the main probably believe it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However strongly I may disagree with the views that some people have expressed, I welcome the fact that we have had a comprehensive and wide ranging debate on these Bills.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus Bill. It involves a number of minor amendments to various pieces of health legislation: for example, substituting the term `patient' for `in-patient' in the Health Insurance Act. In 1989, changes were made to allow for payments for day surgery procedures and patients no longer had to be admitted to hospital overnight to qualify for benefits. At the time, changes which were necessary in the Health Insurance Act to address this change were overlooked.

We spend enormous amounts of time in this chamber fixing up things that have been overlooked when Bills are brought through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another change grants the Minister the power to determine that a medical practitioner is a specialist in cases where the practitioner has omitted to seek recognition in the speciality.

This was a system that was to be put in place in pharmacies where we would all have an upgraded Medicare card and each pharmacist would have a box in the pharmacy which would be hooked up to the Health Insurance Commission. When anybody went in to get a prescription dispensed, the card would be zapped through the black box and the information would go down to the Health Insurance Commission. Information would come back telling the pharmacist whether the person concerned was eligible for a benefit; that is, whether that person was a resident of Australia and was eligible for the $15.70 benefit, as I think it then was, or the $15.90 benefit as it is now, or whether it involved a pensioner or health care card holder. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions will not now come into effect because the conditions which had been inserted in the commencement provisions could not be met.</PARA>
<PARA>A nice little soft soap line here, and it is true. But what were the conditions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conditions were put in place by the Opposition at the end of the legislation, saying that this could not come into place until the day after a joint inquiry of the Department of Finance and the Auditor-General had reported to both Houses of Parliament that the estimated savings contained in the financial impact statement in the explanatory memorandum to the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1991 were realistic estimates and that equivalent savings could not be obtained through the use of alternative eligibility checking systems which are no more intrusive than the eligibility checking proposals contained in the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Act 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the Auditor-General find? He found two things. The first was that the Department had used an incorrect figure for estimating the number of claims that were made or prescriptions that were dispensed when the person was not entitled to a benefit. That involved a person who got the lower benefit who was not entitled to it and who was not on unemployment benefits, but still had a current card. The Department was wrong in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An even greater mistake was that the Department estimated that the average savings for a basic claim would be $12.50 for each person who was receiving a benefit to which he or she was not entitled. Again, the Department got it totally wrong. It forgot that all of us get a benefit at that stage if the drug costs more than $15. The Department was adding up the average cost and including drugs that were worth $45 and $75, and in that way arrived at its average cost. But even if one was not entitled to the lower benefit as a health care card holder, one still was entitled to the other benefit&mdash;a benefit to which we are all entitled. So when the Department corrected that, it was found that the average cost was $7.93. That was a very basic error. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Somebody said to me&mdash;and I will not say who said it because it was in the confidentiality of the corridors&mdash;`I wonder how many other estimates on which we base budget decisions are wrong?' We found a number of them and this was just one. The situation was just appalling. Instead of achieving a figure of $126m, the Department's net savings would be a maximum loss of $13.9m and the maximum gain $6.8m. That was worked out on a range of the number of fraudulent claims. The Department was going to make a loss. So this huge amount of saving we were going to have suddenly dissipated because of two basic errors made by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened then? Mr Johns came into the chamber and very quietly said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to provisions to institute the black box&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will not now come into effect because the conditions which had been inserted in the commencement provisions could not be met.</PARA>
<PARA>They could not be met because they got it totally wrong. The Department was shown up for not doing the calculations correctly, and the Government was shown up for not following that through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister should have been asking those questions. Without the benefit of all the resources, we on this side were saying, `These figures look shonky; we don't reckon you can get that sort of saving'. From the very beginning, we questioned the savings that would be made by the black box and our concerns have been vindicated. This legislation is an embarrassing back down by the Government of an admission that it was wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A new patient eligibility checking agreement has been negotiated&mdash;`negotiated' may be too kind a word&mdash;between the Pharmacy Guild and the Government. It provides that, unless patients can prove their entitlement to pharmaceuticals at the cheaper concession rate, the pharmacist will have to charge the higher general patient rate of $15.90. Accordingly, this Bill now provides the Health Insurance Commission with the power to provide a refund to concessional beneficiaries who subsequently prove their entitlement to the concession rate. It is understandable that the pharmacists object to playing the policemen for the Government. The pharmacists should not be held responsible or suffer financial loss for mistakes made by the Government&mdash;for instance, where entitlement numbers are incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously the navigation of the agreement waters has seen the Minister's good ship `Eligibility Checking' founder yet again. The Pharmacy Guild issued a press release a couple of weeks ago announcing that it was instituting proceedings in the Federal Court against the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) and the Commonwealth. The Guild action was asking the court to declare unlawful the system introduced on 1 October by the Health Insurance Commission to check on social security and war service pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area which concerns the coalition is the provision which abolishes the six-month period before approval to dispense pharmaceuticals is removed. Currently there is a six-month waiting period before either the Secretary of the Department of Health or the Minister can remove either a pharmacist's, a doctor's or a hospital's approval to dispense pharmaceuticals. This Bill removes this waiting period. Neither the Pharmacy Guild nor the National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals can see any positive rationale for this change, while the latter perceives this to be a further impediment to the private sector and raises the concern that it would allow the Minister to shut down the pharmaceutical operations of a private hospital as soon as it becomes insolvent. The Department of Health has defended the change on the grounds that the power to retract the approval is needed because some approvals are not returned after the close of business. This prevents the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority from issuing approvals to other pharmacists to start business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the coalition is not entirely convinced by this argument and Dr Woods has stated in the House of Representatives that he will be monitoring the situation to make sure that this particular provision is not being abused. The coalition signalled its intention in the House of Representatives that we would be supporting the Bill. However, I wish to move an amendment regarding eligibility checking. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At end of motion, add ", but the Senate calls on the Government to make every possible effort to ensure that entitlement numbers on benefit cards are correct, in particular on interim cards issued by the Department of Social Security, and the pharmacists are not penalised financially as a result of mistakes made by Departments".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second Bill that we are debating tonight, the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1992, also makes a number of minor changes to legislation relating to the health portfolio. The most important is the extension of the sunset clause for R-type diagnostic imaging services to 1 January 1995. Amendments to the Health Insurance Act in 1991 meant that from January 1993 Medicare benefits would not be payable to medical practitioners who rendered diagnostic imaging services. This latest amendment extends the sunset clause to 1995 to allow the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners time to develop accreditation guidelines for GPs who provide radiology services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also introduces a new section 20BA in the Health Insurance Act requiring written referrals by GPs to specialists where a special service is carried out to be retained for 18 months. Such referrals must be provided upon request to the Health Insurance Commission. Both the AMA and the Australian Association of Surgeons support the retention of referrals. However, they are concerned that the Bill provides for the imposition of a $500 penalty for failure to provide patient referrals within seven days. The coalition believes that it is important that referrals be produced upon request and will support the $500 penalty. However, we believe that the seven-day requirement is overly harsh and will move in the committee stage of the Bill&mdash;I think the amendments have been circulated&mdash;to extend the time requirement to 30 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is so often the case with this Government's legislation, this Bill also contains a significant number of amendments which are designed to overcome previous sloppy drafting and legislative oversights. I give some examples. A loophole which allowed pathology practitioners to provide nursing staff at the premises of the doctor or elsewhere has been closed off. Previous sloppy drafting which prevented the cancellation of organisations when the business of all health benefit funds conducted by them had been transferred to another organisation has been rectified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A drafting oversight back in 1987 which had the unintentional consequence of reducing the Medicare benefits schedule fee rebate for optometrical services for private hospital patients from 85 to 75 per cent has also been rectified. A loophole which allows a child to be considered disadvantaged and hence eligible for a health care card has been closed. Finally, this Bill corrects drafting errors in previous legislation pertaining to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These straightforward provisions are supported by the coalition. However, we are concerned that we are constantly required to spend valuable time in this place amending and correcting loopholes and errors in the drafting of Government Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I wish to discuss the parts of the Bill which affect age care and residential age care services&mdash;measures which were announced by the Government in the Budget. While there is a pressing need to provide additional funds for the elderly and their carers, the Government's measures fall far short of what is required to ensure a fair and responsible age care system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for the increase of the domiciliary nursing care benefit. In addition to being tax free and not subject to a means test, the benefit will now be indexed annually on the basis of the CPI. The amendments will also mean that the benefit will be payable to carers for a maximum of 42 days a year while the person is being cared for in respite care. The coalition welcomes the $5 a week increase. It is still woefully inadequate in an era where there is a marked government and community preference for older people to live independently in the community with assistance. It is even more inadequate when it is realised that since its inception the DNCB has not been indexed with inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also a Budget decision to provide additional funding for new and rebuilt private nursing homes and former participating religious and charitable homes. In last year's Budget additional recurrent funding was provided to proprietors over a 10-year period for building new nursing homes or completely rebuilding existing ones. However, difficulties arose because the grants were available only after the nursing home was constructed, requiring operators to have raised the capital for the home before they could apply for additional funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to this criticism, this Budget has sought to address the problem by extending funding available under the system. The Bill introduces an approval in principle system which will allow proprietors to borrow against increased recurrent funding prior to a home being built or rebuilt. However, if no progress is made towards rebuilding, the Bill allows the approval in principle to be revoked and then reallocated. While the coalition does not oppose the introduction of the approval in principle system, it is concerned that the voluntary sector has been virtually excluded from this additional funding without any real valid reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third aspect of the Bill relates to amendments to subsidies currently paid to hostels for personal care and hostel care. The former is paid according to the level of care required by the resident&mdash;high, intermediate or low&mdash;and the latter is available to residents who do not require personal care and who are financially disadvantaged. The amendments in this Bill will provide for an increase in funding in all subsidies for financially disadvantaged persons by 55c a day. To offset this increase, the personal care subsidy for non-financially disadvantaged persons will be reduced by $2.65 per resident per day. In effect, this will mean that there are seven rates of subsidy. The Government intends that at all these levels of care within hostels there will be a $3.20 subsidy difference between financially disadvantaged and non-financially disadvantaged residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has claimed that the amendments are designed to increase equity in the provision of hostel subsidies. It has been reasoned that, as hostels have a greater capacity to raise income from their non-financially disadvantaged residents through entry contributions and variable fees, these amendments will result in government subsidies better targeting support to those in need. However, with the alterations to hostel subsidies, the Government expects savings in expenditure in the vicinity of $34m over the 1992-96 period. The amendments would appear to be more in the nature of a cost cutting exercise than a genuine attempt to implement a more equitable distribution of hostel subsidies. This is also borne out by the fact that the 1992-93 Budget Papers have stated that only 25 per cent of hostels will benefit from the changes, leaving the remaining 75 per cent not being advantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the coalition supports the increase in subsidy for FDPs, it decries the cut in personal care subsidies for those who are non-financially disadvantaged which will have a detrimental economic effect not only on the substantial number of hostel residents but also on the viability of many hostels. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We spoke this morning to a person who has been supervising a very large community program which offers a range of services from child-care, family care and family counselling to home and community care programs in the community and hostels and nursing homes. This person has been running these places since the early 1970s, one of the jewels in the crown in the area of providing an all-round service to families and relatives who are coping with maybe a child who has a problem or family problems and who are also simultaneously caring for an older relative who needs home and community care or residential care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This person said to me, `Our hostel will go bankrupt. That is what will happen as a result of this. The other thing we may have to do is to look towards having people who can make an ingoing, because we are going to have to balance people who can make an ingoing against those who are financially disadvantaged'. I hope that my colleagues around this chamber will never see that day&mdash;the day when decisions are based not on need but on whether a person can pay. That is not the aim of any of us, I presume, in this chamber, but that is what people are saying will happen as a result of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under many existing contracts between residents and proprietors, entry contributions or monthly fees may not be altered until an annual review, a CPI adjustment or with the agreement of the residents. Therefore, the reduction in subsidies for non-FDPs will have a severe effect on many homes' financial viability. As I said, we were told this morning by people who came to see us, who have a record of surviving, that their hostel is in doubt. This includes small or remote hostels that rely heavily on their local community for capital fund raising. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Difficulties also arise in the current definition of FDP for the purpose of recurrent funding in hostels. The current definition does not reflect the capacity of hostel residents to pay increased fees. As Aged Care Australia has noted, many elderly hostel residents have the full age pension as their sole source of income, but they are still classed as non-FDPs. Under the Government's proposed amendments, their hostel subsidy will be cut by $2.65 per day which, on the face of it, clearly seems unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aged Care Australia has recommended that the definition of FDP be changed to include any resident in receipt of the full single age pension who does not own a home. This definition would have significant financial implications. I believe that that or some alternative should be considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs in light of the harshness of the changes included in this Bill. One of the reasons we are referring the legislation to that Committee is so that it can examine the submissions that have been put forward to us and, in particular, that suggestion from Aged Care Australia and any possible alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also likely that the creation of additional levels of subsidy will increase the already onerous administrative burden borne by all hostels. Let me tell Senator Bolkus that, if he cares to visit nursing homes and hostels and ask them what they spend most of their time doing, he would be told that it is not on caring for and comforting the aged; it is on filling out forms for departmental officers and various people who request information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth aspect of the Bill relates to changes in the date of effect of reviews of classifications for nursing home residents. At present, nursing home residents are classified on the basis of the resident classification instrument, the RCI, which measures their need for care. In classifying a resident, regional assessors are guided by the nursing home classification principle formulated by the Minister. The Secretary of the Department then has the power to review the classification at any time and may revoke it and substitute a higher or lower classification. However, there is presently no requirement for the Secretary to be guided by the principles when reviewing classification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in this Bill will make it mandatory for the Secretary to observe the nursing home classification principles when reviewing a resident's classification. Further, the Bill provides that, where a resident classification is reviewed and altered, the subsequent classification will take effect from the date of the original classification and not from the date of the validation as is currently the norm. That is absolutely appalling. In this way, where the Secretary revokes the classification, which requires a lower funding level, the nursing home proprietor will be required to repay the Commonwealth the difference in funding between the reclassified level and the level of original subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This refund will be required even though the nursing home proprietor has already spent the money on personal care for the resident. In effect, this amendment will impose a system of retrospective reclassification which is inherently unfair. It will have an adverse financial impact on many nursing homes and is strenuously opposed by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerns have also been raised by the aged care industry about the impact of the classification amendments. Aged Care Australia has again been critical of the Government's failure to consult with those most affected by the changes. Both the National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals and the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association have been particularly condemnatory of the way the amendments will allow the RCI auditors, acting on behalf of the Secretary, to have the power to override the initial assessment and make retrospective judgments about the nursing requirements of residents. Moreover, with the majority of reviews in the past 12 months having resulted in residents' classifications being upgraded, concerns have been raised that a massive upgrade of residents could send a home into bankruptcy or, at the very least, result in a genuine reduction in the standard of care received by elderly residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills has today reported on this aspect of the Bill and has expressed concern about its retrospectivity. The Committee report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However the Committee is concerned by what may be possible in relation to reviews which are determined after the commencement of the proposed new subsections. It would appear that, under the proposed new subsections, a reclassification which is determined after the commencement of those new subsections could be expressed to operate retrospectively, whether the reclassification is beneficial to the patient or not. If this is the case, it is a matter of great concern to the Committee. The Committee would therefore appreciate the Minister's advice as to whether or not this is the case.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously this matter is also of grave concern to the Opposition, and we call on the Minister to take heed of the Committee's remarks and respond to them. The effect of the amendments in this Bill on the viability of the aged care sector and the maintenance of existing services for residents is significant. These matters clearly require further scrutiny by the Senate Committee before implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aged care industry has been subjected to significant change over the past five years, and it is currently being swamped by paperwork and departmental requirements.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to look at the two omnibus Bills being debated cognately&mdash;the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 and the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992. Generally, the first Bill covers a large number of mainly technical amendments which relate largely to health and community services legislation. The Australian Democrats support the Bill and will not be moving any amendments to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to make many comments on this Bill. However, there is one area of considerable concern, that is, the fact that this Bill brings to an end what we can term `the black box shambles'. This interactive eligibility checking system or, as it became known, the black box, was a particularly ill-conceived idea from the Government which, as it has turned out, was based largely on conjecture and anecdotal material; it certainly was not based on solid evidence. The black box is yet another instance in the health area where the Government has gone full steam ahead with a proposal without consultation and without looking for hard evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other instance which springs to mind is the changes to radiology services. In that case the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs looked in detail at the implications of those changes. The eventual decision was a unanimous one&mdash;to repeal the regulations and to suggest that a further detailed review of radiology be undertaken before any further suggestions of changes be made. It was a similar story with the black box. The Government's figures on just about every aspect of the proposal turned out to be little more than guesswork. It took the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration finally to get to the bottom of the story and get the figures right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do have a lot of sympathy for the Government trying to make reform in some health areas. There are obviously very entrenched vested interests involved who take a great deal of overriding interest&mdash;or perhaps we can best say that they protect their particular territory very well; they do not even like to see the edges of their territory in any way eroded. So it is obviously very difficult in some cases to make changes. However, it is in nobody's interests to proceed with what really are half-baked ideas and to get them to the stage of legislation and regulation without all the available evidence, without consultation and certainly without any very reliable data. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at both of these hearings&mdash;into pharmacy and radiology&mdash;we see that neither the Health Insurance Commission nor the Department were able to supply the Government with reliable data. What we saw were a lot of guesstimates, hunches and anecdotal evidence with very few facts on which to base what were really quite major changes. Obviously, as I said, the Senate Committees recognised that that was not good enough. The withdrawal of the radiology regulations and the black box provisions surely must be a signal to the Government that in future it really does need to get the facts straight and the evidence right before it proceeds and continues with action like this. I hope that both these instances demonstrate to the Government the wisdom of undertaking wide consultation when proposing such changes. I am not saying here that the Government has to take on board everything that it is told, but at least there should be consultation, the weighing up of all the evidence and full investigations made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the second Bill, imaginatively entitled Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill No. 2, this contains several provisions relating to the aged and some of these are of great concern to the Democrats. In fact, we have combined with the Opposition to send parts 2 and 5 of this Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs for further examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go to these specific matters, I want briefly to discuss the general amendments relating to health in this Bill. Many of these amendments correct errors in previous legislation and are not controversial. However, I must make the point here that there really does need to be a general smartening up as far as drafting of legislation in the health area is concerned. I do understand that some problems can arise because it is a very complex area of legislation; however, it is simply not good enough to keep passing legislation and then having to undo it and redo it again and again. We seem to devote an enormous amount of time in this chamber actually to fixing up errors that have gone through in previous pieces of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has indicated its intention to move an amendment, which I will deal with now. The Bill requires consultant physicians or specialists to retain any referral for a period of 18 months. The referral will then have to be produced on request to an officer of the Health Insurance Commission within seven days of the request being made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that Dr Woods in the House of Representatives and now Senator Patterson in this chamber failed to mention when presenting and discussing these amendments that there is a clause relating to this seven-day limit that actually gives an exemption; that is, where the consultant physician or specialist has a reasonable excuse. So, if there is a problem&mdash;for example, the specialist may be overseas, there may be a change of address, there simply may be some lost mail&mdash;there is an avenue of appeal. Really, I am at a loss to understand why the Opposition is now going to proceed with this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are talking about taxpayers' money, it seems perfectly reasonable to require professionals to have a standard of administration in their office that is sufficiently efficient that they can put their hands on documents, that documents can be filed away, that they can know the actual place that those documents can be found and then be able to submit them within seven days if they are requested. If circumstances out of the ordinary apply, then they can appeal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Opposition that there has to be some reason for such a request to be made. People are not being asked to supply such information because somebody thought it might be a good idea. There is an investigation under way and that is material that is required. It may be to the specialist's advantage to prove that there is no improper conduct and that there is absolutely no shred of evidence of any fraud. So surely it would be in the doctor's best interest to make sure he or she could always put his or her hand very quickly on such information. I have to wonder, if we were talking about social security recipients having to produce evidence, whether some people would be quite so keen to give them all those extra weeks in which to do it. Unfortunately, I doubt it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to turn now to the provisions in the Bill relating to aged care. Firstly, I want to make a very brief comment on the domiciliary nursing care benefit. This Bill provides for an increase of $5 a week. It also provides for indexation of the benefit and makes it payable during respite periods of up to 42 days in any one year. These measures are certainly overdue; they are welcomed by the Democrats as a recognition of the role and needs of carers of both aged people and people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to parts 2 and 5 of the Bill, as I said earlier, the Senate Committee will be looking at these in detail. The Democrats will be moving amendments in committee after we have considered all of the evidence. However, I do feel that I have to make it very clear at this stage that measures being proposed by the Government in these two parts are not acceptable to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that these measures as proposed at the moment are not adequate and will cause considerable problems. Part 2 relates to hostel subsidies. This Bill gives effect to the Government's decision to increase the hostel and personal care subsidy for financially disadvantaged people by 55c a day and decrease the personal care subsidy for non-financially disadvantaged persons by $2.65. This represents a significant change in the Government's subsidy policy and it certainly appears from correspondence I have had to my office that it is yet another move the Government has taken without consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I consider this to be extremely ill-conceived. It is a move that I believe the nursing home and hostel industry has every right to be up in arms about. The industry is quite rightly arguing that the cut in personal care subsidies for non-financially disadvantaged persons will have a detrimental effect on a number of hostel residents and indeed on the viability of many hostels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rationale behind this move seems to be that hostels have a greater capacity to generate income from their non-financially disadvantaged residents and that any subsidies coming from the Government should be targeted at those with the greatest need. That sounds quite fair on the surface, but as Aged Care Australia has identified in material it has supplied to my office, there are quite a number of flaws in this approach. Firstly, for many hostels, existing contracts will preclude adjustments to residents' fees until either the annual review, automatic adjustment or with the resident's permission. This is likely to leave hostels with an operating shortfall. I note that the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association has argued that this problem could be alleviated by having the changes apply only to residents who move into a hostel, after this legislation is proclaimed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Government itself concedes that 80 to 90 per cent of residents are in receipt of a full pension. Yet when we look at how many are actually officially classified as financially disadvantaged, we see that the ratio is 54.5 : 45.5. Obviously, there is a big gap between those on a full pension and the number actually classified as being financially disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, interest income for that non-financially disadvantaged section has recently fallen dramatically. Many of those persons simply do not have the capacity to pay increased fees. Fourthly, hostels have limited capital resources and cannot be expected to rely on interest income to fund any shortfall. Aged Care Australia says that 60 per cent of residents entering hostel accommodation are financially disadvantaged, yet the Commonwealth building subsidy is generally pitched at 15 to 40 per cent financially disadvantaged persons, something the industry described as a `major mismatch' between departmental theory and reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the Government needs to address these problems and I believe the industry has put a good case for a reduction in the cut to the personal care subsidy for non-financially disadvantaged persons. That reduction, from $2.65 to $1.45, will give them some respite and relieve some of the problems they believe will occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, aside from the actual size of the cut, I suggest a very positive move would be to change the definition of a financially disadvantaged person. As the industry has pointed out, many so-called non-financially disadvantaged persons are now on the full age pension. The definition clearly needs to be changed and hopefully this is one area we will be looking at in committee and will receive support from the Opposition to amend when this Bill comes back before the Senate next week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To look now at part 5, the Bill also makes several changes to the resident classification process. The main area of concern is the proposal to allow for retrospective classification of nursing home residents. At present, the residents are classified according to the resident classification instrument. This classification is done by the nursing homes according to these very strict guidelines and then at a later date, unfortunately in many cases at a much later date, it is validated. If there is a change in the classification, that change takes effect from the date of the validation or thereabouts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal in this Bill means that where a classification is subsequently changed, the change has effect from either the date of the resident's admission or the date of his or her last assessment, whichever is the later. The practical down side of this will be that, where a lower classification is substituted, the nursing home proprietor will be required to repay to the Commonwealth the difference between the first classification and the latter level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of obvious problems with this. Firstly, these classifications are being done in accordance with the departmental guidelines, as I have said. I have heard no comment from the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) as to whether there is any deliberate misclassification going on out there, whether there is any deliberate, fraudulent behaviour whereby somehow people are being classified as needing a higher degree of care than they really do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If indeed there is a problem, I ask the Minister to put that on the table. Without that evidence it seems unfair and not very sensible to let experienced staff assess and classify residents when they come in, and then to say at a later date that the classification is retrospectively altered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it is not as if proprietors are salting away the additional money. They are classifying persons in need of a specific level of care and that money is being spent on providing that care. There are no funds salted away in a bank account that can simply be produced and forwarded to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, I wonder whether there is not some danger in this arrangement of encouraging nursing homes of always erring on the side on caution when classifying. Perhaps residents will not get the standard of care they require until that validation occurs, just in case a mistake is made. In other words, they err on the side of saying, `Maybe they do not require that level of care. We will put them up a classification so that we are not running the risk of spending money that later on we will have to return'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, I simply do not see how proprietors will be able to plan their budgets with any confidence whatsoever if these retrospective elements are allowed to pass through this place. I accept that the RCI reviews show that in the majority of instances there is actually an upgrading. While that is fine, it does not address the concerns raised by the industry in relation to residents whose classifications are downgraded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that a more appropriate response from the Government would be to get its act together and ensure that validations are carried out very quickly. I note with interest Senator Patterson's comments. I hope we can join together to make sure that this Bill is not passed with any retrospective element in it. This is something we will need to look at closely during the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I make the general observation that I think the Government has done a reasonable job in relation to improving conditions for residents in nursing homes and hostels. The Democrats have always been of the view that, if we are going to have a for-profit service looking after frail, elderly or disabled people, we must have in place a good level of government scrutiny and regulation. In this regard many positive measures have been introduced by Minister Staples. I believe that he can take credit for some of the changes that have gone on in the industry in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I have to say that the funding arrangements and constraints being imposed on the industry are getting tighter and tighter, to the point where they are becoming more and more complicated and more and more of a burden on the industry. More and more nursing homes and hostels are finding themselves squeezed to the very limits of their ability to offer good quality, high standard care. Staffing levels are being squeezed to the point where only essential nursing services can be offered and a lot of the highly necessary and certainly desirable services have had to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry is also complaining of lack of advance notice of changes in financial measures. I believe that this complaint certainly has a great deal of validity. The industry sees itself as being asked to cope simultaneously with tougher and tougher financial constraints, while being asked&mdash;and quite rightly&mdash;to smarten up its act in relation to standards for both personal care and physical surroundings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is certainly fair enough. The Government has to get value for its money. But the problems which are arising from the continuing tightening and rapid change undermine the relationship between the Government and the industry at a time when some degree of cooperation and mutual confidence is crucial&mdash;indeed, essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these decisions appear to be driven solely by the requirement to save money in the short term, without any real look at all at the long term. This is not a satisfactory approach to take, especially where such a vulnerable and disadvantaged group of Australians is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two Budget measures contained in this Bill seem to me to be underpinned by precisely that motivation. The fact that they were brought in with virtually no consultation with the industry whatsoever gives us all the evidence we need to see that this is the case. It certainly does not inspire any confidence within the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hate to see the Minister's good work in this area go down the drain as a consequence of ill-considered financial decisions such as these, and I urge him to try to ensure that these sorts of short-term, financially expedient decisions do not continue. I am aware of the current review of the structure of nursing home funding. I trust that this really does represent a genuine attempt on the part of the Government to sit down with industry and community organisations working in the field and explore seriously ways of getting long-term value for the taxpayers' dollars, without undermining the standards of care being provided to residents. Perhaps the Minister could look at a similar process for hostels. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill. This is another piece of legislation which this Labor Government is using in an attempt to make some ongoing minor repairs to a fundamentally ailing health system. Therefore, this Bill provides us with an opportunity to take an overview of where Australia is heading in regard to health care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, many people throughout Australia are very concerned about health care in Australia today. They can see that they are not getting anywhere and that their access to hospitals is being reduced. People are simply dying at the end of waiting lists. As the saying goes, if one asks a silly question, one gets a silly answer. That is what we are getting with a lot of this legislation which is before us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence continues to mount that Labor's blind, ideological obsession to try to shore up Medicare while ignoring the private sector is giving more and more Australians a worse deal for their health. The latest report from the Western Australia Health Department in August shows that 10,814 people were on the waiting lists of our public hospitals for elective surgery at the end of March. This represented an increase from the figure of 10,676 in the previous quarter. The largest category was 2,656 people waiting for orthopaedic surgery. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, what an intelligent interjection we have just had from Senator West! She said that there are no orthopods who could actually do the orthopaedic surgery.

Well, I'll be blowed!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that there are people with these problems who cannot get into hospitals. They can see the doctor, the doctor can do the surgery, but when they tap on the front door of the hospital they are told, `Sorry, no beds'. That is the point I am making. That is the point that Senator West's State colleague in Western Australia, Mr Wilson, also agrees with. Either Senator West is wrong or Mr Wilson is wrong. </PARA>

He will be delighted to hear that a mere, meagre little backbencher in the Federal Parliament has said that he is wrong, when he clearly says that he can see the effects of the waiting lists in Western Australia. Those are the problems that are being experienced in Western Australia and right throughout Australia. The answer that Senator West just gave is the sort of stupid, silly answer that we get from the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose before I make my next comment, I should pre-empt Senator West's next interjection that there are no surgeons to carry out eye surgery either. Some 1,531 people are awaiting general eye surgery and 1,208 need surgery for ophthalmology. I suppose Senator West will say, `That is not because they cannot get into hospital. That is because there are no ophthalmologists'. These are hardly conditions that I would say are elective, in the sense that there is no hardship in having to wait a while. The bald statistics mean that a lot of individual pain is being suffered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those bald statistics also mean a lot to the bills that this country can run up. We have people who are waiting for surgery for things like hip replacements, knee replacements, intra-ocular lenses and so forth who are going lame or blind, who are not able to work and who then have to go on to sickness benefits. So those individuals cease being part of the work force, cease paying tax and go on to benefits that the reducing number of taxpayers has to fund. The likes of Senator West could not give a continental about that imbalance and the way in which that impacts on the fewer and fewer people who are paying tax today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need only look at some of the examples that are so often reported in the press. Take an incident in Kalgoorlie last June. There was a report of a 67-year-old lady who had to wait three months for heart surgery at the Royal Perth Hospital. There is no need to say that that dear old lady had been diagnosed in November and died on 13 February, just before the operation was due. That is what I mean when I talk about people dying at the end of the queue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator West is now trying to justify that position as well. The great tragedy of it is that this Government will continue to try to justify people dying on the queue instead of solving the problem and allowing people to gain access to either public or private hospitals. Sadly, that is how some Australians, such as the 67-year-old lady, move from waiting lists. It is not the fault of the hospitals; it comes squarely back to the health system. Unfortunately, until this Government realises that there is such a problem, it will not do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A 68-year-old war service pensioner was told in February 1991 that he would have to wait a couple of months for a hernia operation. Late in June 1992 he was still waiting, having had a booking cancelled in May. Again, it is not the hospital that is to blame for having to give priority to more urgent cases. The examples continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February, a woman was put on a waiting list for sinus surgery and told it would take two and a half years unless she paid $1,400 for private treatment. This is the choice that people are being confronted with. An 84-year-old public patient, who had a cataract removed in 1989, needed further treatment. He was told that he must wait 12 months. His family was then told by the specialist that, at his age, it was not worth it. I might add that he found the money for private treatment. But he was told that it was not worth it; that he may as well just go blind and let his quality of life deteriorate. It is a pretty sad reflection on our health system that we are prepared to allow people, because of their age, to go blind. That should not be permitted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A woman was forced to wait six months for surgery on her achilles tendon. She was then told that she would have to wait a further six months but got treatment a month after this when her right tendon ruptured. She had to wait for emergency treatment. She could not get the treatment there and then on the spot. Only as an emergency patient was she eventually admitted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A pensioner couple are trying to pay $10,000 in instalments for emergency hip surgery in a private hospital after failing to meet the membership criteria of Medibank Private. Where does this end? I can go on with story after story of all these people that this Labor Government is consistently locking out from access to public hospitals. Because of its ideological bent that it will not encourage private health insurance, the problem will not be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other Australians such as those whom I have mentioned will be faced with similar pain because this Labor Government simply refuses to face the facts and encourage private insurance. The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) did not heed the plea from the Hospitals Benefits Fund managing director, Ray Walker, that privately insured Australians, such as the 560,000 covered by HBF, be exempted from the Medicare levy increase. He would not even consider any change. The Minister could not care less that, of the 826,000 Australians over 65, 42 per cent of that age bracket are still finding the money for private insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If private health insurance is that crook, why do so many people want it? Why do so many aged people want private insurance? The Minister has also not taken any notice of the plea made on 28 May by the health Minister of the Western Australian Government, Mr Wilson, to whom I referred earlier, that more affluent Australians be penalised if they do not take private insurance and that a tax concession be given for self-provision. The Minister would not listen to Mr Wilson. Mr Wilson knows too much about the story; he is seeing it at the coalface. But somehow or other the key decision makers in this Labor Government do not wish to see it at the coalface or accept the realities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Wilson, in saying what he is, is arguing for the main principles of what we are suggesting in Fightback, with the support of the health professionals. But he commits the heresy of supporting the private sector, so he will be ignored and, no doubt, quietly removed from the health portfolio if the opportunity ever arises. I do not expect that Labor will get re-elected in Western Australia, but if there were a way of shifting Mr Wilson out of the portfolio today, it would certainly do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How serious about health care is this Labor Government when in June it could find $150,000 for the Osborne Park hospital in Perth for a new birthing unit while depriving the same hospital $80,000 for its family medicine program, which trains doctors who care for 40 women and babies each week? It may be because the Osborne Park hospital just happens to be in the most marginal Labor seat that the Labor Party currently holds&mdash;the seat of Stirling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet again, a little funding fiasco is going on with the Osborne Park hospital in the same way that funding went to the Stirling City Council through the Budget. Is it not interesting that all these little funding deals come about in such a way? Of course, Mr Edwards will not need to worry about his seat of Stirling, because the endorsed Liberal candidate, Mr Eoin Cameron, will absolutely romp it in at the next election. He understands the problems of Stirling. He understands that there are people who need hospital treatment and that just switching dollars for dollars does not make any sense. Therefore, the current situation will all come to a halt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We get bandaids on buckets all the time. Royal Perth Hospital, probably the major hospital in Perth, like all WA public hospitals is faced with a 20 per cent fall in Federal funding since Medicare and must institute low activity days every fourth Friday when the theatres are shut down and more people are denied the treatment they need.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read last week where another public hospital is looking at cutting out the low activity days because it is putting extra pressure on its other services on other days.

He knows how many people knock on the front door of a public hospital only to have someone from inside say to them, `Sorry, pal, no bed. Go home'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing will stop these appalling pressures on public hospitals when, during the last year, private cover declined from 44.4 per cent to 41.9 per cent, thus adding $128m to State hospital costs. There is a further decline year after year. More and more people are pulling out of private health insurance and this Government does not care. It provides no incentive for people to privately insure. It ensures that people keep on queuing at the public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier in the life of Medicare, declining membership came mainly from those in the lowest table who lacked private hospital cover. Since December 1990, however, private hospital cover has fallen from 39.3 per cent to 37.5 per cent. Some 530,000 more Australians came to rely on Medicare, two-thirds of them as a result of the decline in private cover. Does the Minister care that public hospitals had to pay an extra $233m? It appears not, because nothing has been done to reverse the trends. These trends have not just been here since the depression that we are now in&mdash;not a recession, but a depression&mdash;and they have been consistently going down and down through the life of Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Premiums for private cover rose by 14.5 per cent on average between 1985 and 1991 and subsequently are now up 20 per cent. This can only mean that more Australians are adding to the Medicare queues. If we get more people back into the private hospital system and the private health insurance system, the overall cost will be spread across more people. But does the Government want to do that? No way. It still wants people to be reliant on Medicare. Private funds will be faced with more losses, leading to higher premiums, unless the situation is reversed. Yet this Government still refuses to reverse the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 theatre benefit costs for over 65s rose 40 per cent and benefits payments for prostheses rose by 34 per cent. This Labor Government does not appear to care and will do nothing for these Australians earning less than $31,000 who comprise 40 per cent of those privately insured.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> the Liberal and National parties are talking about a dramatic contrast to what this Government has been doing. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">! </EMPHASIS>gives rebates for private insurance to all Australian families with incomes below $30,000. That contrast could not be more obvious than when measured against what this Government is doing. The Government is squeezing out low income people because they cannot take out private health insurance without extreme hardship. Once again, Labor gives us its unique version of social justice by encouraging 30 per cent of Australians earning more than $41,600 and 20 per cent of those earning over $52,000 to remain uninsured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Labor Government continues in its contemptuous treatment of health professionals by its impositions on pharmacists, forcing them to police the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, so that after one warning regarding incorrect numbers the liability falls on the pharmacists. I cannot understand this Government. I have been here for a number of years and I have watched all this legislation go through. If the Government is not trying to pick off the specialists, it is trying to pick off the GPs. If it is not trying to pick off the GPs, it is trying to pick off the pharmacists. If it is not trying to pick off the pharmacists, it is trying to pick off the pathologists. Where does it end?

I agree that there is a vast difference between the Opposition and the Labor Party in respect of the way in which medical and hospital care is to be provided for Australians into the next decade and the next century. That is basically because the Opposition is obsessed with the idea of Medicare as part of its original impetus as a way in which to finance the health system, rather than the more expansive orientation which is part of the approach under the new Medicare agreement being sponsored by the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, Mr Brian Howe. What we are concerned with in Medicare, revamped, is a comprehensive health care approach which will enable Australians to have access to affordable health care. </PARA>

I was going to say it was generous, but it is simply just and proper that that sort of expenditure be undertaken by the Federal Labor Government in support of the public hospital system which is properly lauded by all Australians. I was at the Royal Hobart Hospital only last week opening the hyperbaric chamber, which deals with treatment of the bends and, more recently with innovations in medical knowledge, with the better healing of wounds such as burns and so on. It is a very big project at our leading public and teaching hospital in Hobart. I am quite sure that that hospital will benefit greatly from the increased expenditure under the proposed Medicare agreement that will go into the support of those public hospitals. Not only will that expenditure go into the public hospitals generally, but it will go into a special program of moneys&mdash;I think it is $71m over the next two years&mdash;that will be devoted to a reduction in waiting lists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I very much hope that the Western Australian Government has been able to agree&mdash;as I understand from talking to the Minister for Health, Mr Howe&mdash;to an assent to the Medicare agreement, perhaps modified a little to deal with the particular requirements of Western Australia, but in a way which will now allow that money to flow to reduce waiting lists in Western Australia. That must be extremely gratifying. I certainly hope it reduces the suffering of those who have a clinical need for treatment and who have found themselves not able to get the prompt and ready access to public hospitals which they would wish and which their medical advisers would wish for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are just general remarks in support of the proposition put so well by Senator Knowles that there is a vast gulf between the approach of the Federal Government and the Federal Opposition to these matters. We are certainly not in favour of the private health insurance approach which is that it will be compulsory for every Australian to take out private health insurance. We know that the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, has gone to an AMA meeting and spoken in terms of the AMA being able to set the fees for treatment, for example, by a GP. We know that what the Opposition has in mind is that market forces should operate and the insurance system should match up to whatever the market happens to be charging, even though the Opposition leaves some sort of gap, as I recall. But I think this idea that the private health insurance premium should be compulsorily required of every Australian, in addition to their taxation contribution and their Medicare levy contribution, is something which I am sure will be rejected by the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will be aware that we are discussing two Bills. The first is simply called the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. It covers matters which appear to be minor and procedural, but I am sure it will have a profound impact on the better provision of hospital treatment, for example, for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will know that it has certainly been an aim of the medical profession, and even private health insurance funds and governments, to encourage a move towards day surgery and day-only procedures which are consistent with modern medical practice and which allow the patient to return home on the same day as treatment. Terms have been used and definitions employed in various statutes which have provided something of an incentive for hospitals and so on to think about the need to occupy a bed for private health insurance benefit purposes. We want to reduce the financial incentive for patients to be admitted overnight and to try to encourage the move towards day surgery and day-only procedures&mdash;as I say, where they are consistent with best medical practice and the clinical needs of the person concerned. That is achieved by various changes in definition, nomenclature, in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will also be matters to do with tightening up of those procedures where persons who are entitled to concessional benefits attend a pharmacy and the local pharmacist has to be satisfied as to the identity of the person concerned in order to ensure that the person is truly entitled to concessional treatment. For example, as we all know, the difference can be many dollars for the person concerned&mdash;perhaps $2.60 versus up to $15.70, which can apply to those who pay the ordinary rate at the time of dispensing. That has to be better regulated and is provided for in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important Bill is the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). Even in that slight distinction&mdash;(No. 2)&mdash;one can tell that it deals with an entirely different subject matter. Principally, it is to do with the way in which the Government relates to the carers, particularly of frail, older people in our community. These people are remarkable. I had the great privilege of meeting with the home and community care networks in the midlands of Tasmania both at Campbelltown and at Oatlands in recent weeks where I had some insight into the way in which care is organised through the various mobile teams and those very compassionate, but practical, people in the community&mdash;generally women, I have to say, Madam Acting Deputy President&mdash;who provide tremendous service for those who are frail, elderly, housebound or maybe disabled in one way or another and who would otherwise be required to take up residence in a nursing home or some other institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been very gratifying to meet such big hearted Australians as those whom I met at that time, and, again, in Hobart at a meeting of carers, in the sense of those who are perhaps spouses, children or parents of those who have suffered some traumatic accident or some chronic illness and who need treatment. Of course, once again, compassion and the loving instincts of the carers concerned mean that they take on the burden of care of those family members usually within their own household, at tremendous cost to their own health, to their social activity and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So not only does this Bill recognise the tremendous role that such carers play by increasing, in a minor way, the sort of financial support that they are entitled to, but there is the recognition that they should continue to receive the benefit during respite care of up to 42 days a year. The recognition of the need for such respite periods, if they are able to take them, is an important part of this Bill. Once again, I think that the matter of respite care available to carers, as much as to those for whom they care, is very major and is one that this community does have to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could take the Senate through a further review of nursing home and hostel matters, but I think that that would possibly be repeating matters which are well known to honourable senators, and, therefore, perhaps would not add to the sum of knowledge which has been fully committed to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> by contributions from such people as Senator Patterson, Senator Lees and Senator West already during the course of this debate.

In other words, it deals with day visits to clinics, hospitals and so on. What is the clinical procedure for surgery that is most likely to be affected by this particular measure?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I mentioned in my response to the second reading debate that this measure is not concerned with dealing with matters which in the opinion of the medical advisers to a patient properly require an overnight stay. That is the point. At the moment there are definitions which could provide an incentive to encourage a person to stay overnight in a hospital in order for the hospital to get the full benefit of the private health insurance payments. The definitions are being altered to make sure that there is no artificial incentive of that kind and that if, in the clinical judgment of the medical practitioners or advisers to the person, a procedure could be carried out quite adequately within the course of a three-, four- or five-hour visit to the hospital, that ought to be undertaken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, the measure is simply intended to remove the definitional matter which has proved to be an incentive, or a temptation perhaps, for an overnight stay where it is not required. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we have to be a little careful. What normally happens is that the patient assigns the payment of the benefit to the hospital, so in either case, I suppose, the hospital is the end beneficiary of the payment. Of course, a lower payment will be made to the hospital or clinic concerned for a confined three- or four-hour visit and procedure undertaken in a hospital than would be the case if there was an overnight stay. This is simply to remove that temptation to encourage the patient to stay overnight, which might be an artificial and unneeded stay in the hospital, which could, of course, earn more money for the hospital.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill reintroduces Part 7 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992&mdash;the provisions to licence Subscription Television Broadcasting Services, or Pay TV.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As we are all aware this section was removed from the original Bill by the Opposition parties in this chamber four months ago.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I expressed dismay at the time that Pay TV may never again emerge from the "black hole" of the Senate Committee system to which it was referred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Committee acted expeditiously to complete its hearings and bring down its Report which was tabled in this Chamber on September 16.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I thank Senator Chris Schacht for his efforts as Chair of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee sought to resolve two major issues: how and when Pay TV service licences would be issued; and how best the ABC could participate in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite its best endeavours the Committee did not provide the Government with a ready solution to the impasse on Pay TV. I did not expect it would.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The debate has moved on even since the Committee tabled its report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Optus recently advised the Government it now intends to move to digital transmission as soon as the technology is available. It proposes to sell channels not transponders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most potential bidders for a licence have also informed the Government they will wait for digital technology on satellites before starting services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government therefore proposes to mandate the use of digital technology for Pay TV using Optus satellites.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Opting for digital satellite systems will place Australia at the forefront of world developments in direct-to-home satellite broadcasting technology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current licence conditions on Optus only require it to make available 6 channels for Pay TV until mid-1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Optus has agreed to provide satellite capacity for up to  10 Pay TV program services until 1 July 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To allocate this capacity equitably, and recognising the commercial requirements of this new industry, the Government intends to issue two commercial licences A and B to provide up to four Pay TV program channels on the Optus satellite.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These will be issued simultaneously using a price-based allocation system under the provisions at section 93.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The choice of the digital system will be a joint decision by licensees A and B in consultation with Optus.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important that this decision is left to the commercial judgement of the operators because of the significant cost involved in the reception technology and the extent to which it can be adapted to meet licensee needs (eg pay-per-view, interactivity).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The system chosen will be used by, and accessible to, all satellite Pay TV service providers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The chosen system will then be set as a standard by the Minister for Transport and Communications under section 94(1).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any disagreement will be arbitrated by the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No further satellite Pay TV licences, other than that for the ABC which I will outline in a moment, will be sold before July 1 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hence section 96(3) states that the Australian Broadcasting Authority must not, before that date, allocate a satellite licence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Satellite Pay TV licences issued after that date will be allocated under the provisions of section 96 for single program services, with the Trade Practices Act operating to govern ownership limits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to note there will be no restriction on the use of other technologies to deliver Pay TV such as cable or microwave (MDS).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They will be licensed under section 96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These will be vetted by the Trade Practices Commission under section 97 before licences are issued to ensure competition policy objectives are met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now wish to turn to the role of the ABC in the proposed Pay TV industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has always sought to have the ABC participate in a sensible, commercial manner with three vitally important caveats.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the ABC's core free to air TV services suffer no detriment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the tax payer not be exposed to any financial risk from ABC involvement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the ABC board accept responsibility for the extent of the national broadcaster's involvement, given their fiduciary duties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill provides at section 93(2) that a third licence&mdash;licence C&mdash;to provide up to 2 Pay TV services be allocated to a subsidiary of the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will maintain its earlier commitment to give the ABC $12.5m in seed finance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extent to which the ABC participates in Pay TV, forms commercial relationships with licensee A and/or B and other subscription service providers, and the nature and extent of programming will be left to the discretion of the ABC Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To minimise the risk to the Commonwealth from the ABC's involvement the Government will use ministerial powers to set licence conditions under section 93(3) to require it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to operate its Pay TV services through a subsidiary company with a separate board;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to require that borrowings of its subsidiary over $2m are guaranteed only with ministerial approval;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to require that an approved charging regime be developed for use of ABC assets and for goods and services provided to its subsidiary; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to require that an accounting regime on a fully attributed cost basis be developed that fully brings to account profits and losses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cross-media ownership limits will apply to licence A at sections 106 to 108 of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These will prevent control and allow a maximum of 2% equity for commercial television broadcasters, large circulation newspapers and the telecommunications carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions facilitate diversity in media ownership by allowing at least one new player in Australia's media.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is confident there will be a number of bidders for this licence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No ownership and control restrictions will be applied to newspapers, incumbent commercial television licensees and telecommunications carriers participating in licence B.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is to offset the special treatment given to the ABC and to allow the structural adjustment of the incumbent commercial television licensees to the new medium.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not intend to place a legislative straitjacket on the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Either or both licensee A and B can participate with the ABC in licence C subject to any conditions specified by the Minister for Transport and Communications and the provisions of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I do intend to set a condition under my powers at section 93(3) that the ABC must retain a majority equity holding in its licence at all times.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 110 provides that neither licensee A nor licensee B can control or hold more than 2% equity in each other.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 2% limit minimises the opportunity to manipulate the ownership limits as a defence against hostile takeovers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It does not penalise business where a small parcel of shares is acquired inadvertently.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Foreign ownership limits at section 109 are to be the same as those proposed earlier&mdash;that is, no more than 20% individual and 35% aggregate foreign holdings in any subscription television broadcasting licence, not just the satellite licences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that the Senate Committee's recommendation to increase program expenditure on Australian drama content on all predominantly drama channels to 15% is unrealistic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 102 confirms our earlier decision by placing a 10% program expenditure requirement on satellite drama services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill places several imposts on the new industry that will add to the cost of Pay TV.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will take some years before Pay TV services reach break-even.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To impose further expenditure requirements on them could threaten their commercial viability.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of Pay TV and the mandating of digital technology presents exciting opportunities for Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation allows licence conditions to be imposed to ensure that licensees A and B put in place adequate Australian industry development arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As we settle these details an important focus will be on the employment opportunities provided by this new industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We recognise that industry development requirements should not be imposed in a heavy handed way.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Providing this degree of protection during a time when further satellite capacity is likely to become available in our region and mandating the use of digital compression technology for the delivery of satellite Pay TV offers significant commercial advantages to Optus.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A regulatory regime for Pay TV in Australia has been 15 years in the making.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has responded in a responsible way to what the Senate has asked for in its Committee report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government was asked to mandate one channel for the ABC&mdash;this legislation gives them two.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have given them funding and allowed them maximum flexibility within the system.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Banking Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 amends the Banking Act 1959, the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959 and the Reserve Bank Act 1959 for several purposes, mainly to give effect to policy measures previously announced by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the Bill amends the Banking Act 1959 to put into effect the Government's policy to liberalise foreign bank entry, which was announced in the One Nation Statement on 26 February 1992. The amendments enable foreign banks, whether they have been operating in Australia or not, to apply for a banking authority under section 9 of the Banking Act 1959.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has decided to permit the issue of banking authorities to foreign-owned banks, where the Reserve Bank is satisfied that the bank and its home supervisor are of sufficient standing, and where the bank agrees to comply with Reserve Bank prudential supervision arrangements. This measure is in line with the Government's commitment to opening up the economy. It will bring benefits of competition in the domestic banking system and improve its international competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, the Bill amends the Banking Act 1959 to permit foreign banks, which are authorised under the Banking Act, to operate as wholesale banks in the form of a branch. Under the current supervisory arrangements, foreign banks are required to be incorporated locally as subsidiaries of the parent bank.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A branch of a foreign bank cannot be subject to the same degree of prudential supervision and depositor protection as can be applied to a subsidiary. The Government places great importance on protecting the interests of depositors via the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank. For this reason, the Government has decided to confine foreign bank branches to wholesale banking. If a foreign bank wishes to conduct retail banking in Australia, it must continue to be incorporated locally as a subsidiary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that this amendment should bring competitive gains and efficiencies, greater flexibility in the provision of finance, and cost advantages to Australian clients. It should also bring advantages to banks and improve the international competitiveness of the Australian financial system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, the Bill amends the Banking Act 1959 to make it  clear that depositors with foreign bank branches are not subject to the depositor protection provisions of the Banking Act. The Bill also provides that foreign bank branches will be required to disclose that they are not subject to the depositor protection provisions of the Banking Act. In addition, if foreign banks do not comply with conditions of their banking authorities, or requirements of the legislation, their banking authorities may be revoked.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fourth, the Bill amends the Banking Act 1959 to complement New South Wales legislation which will enable the State Bank of New South Wales to apply for a banking authority under the Banking Act. The Government has agreed to a request from the New South Wales Government that the State refer its banking powers in this regard to the Commonwealth. The State Bank of New South Wales has indicated that it intends to apply for an authority as soon as the New South Wales legislation is enacted. As an authorised bank under the Banking Act, it will be on the same footing as other authorised banks and subject to the supervisory requirements of the Reserve Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fifth, the Bill amends the Banking Act 1959 to make several minor amendments with respect to unclaimed moneys in bank accounts, and to revoke the banking authority of the Australian Resources Development Bank (ARDB). The few remaining deposit liabilities of ARDB will be transferred to the National Australia Bank Limited, which currently owns all the shares in ARDB.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sixth, Part 3 of the Bill provides for the amendment of section 32 of the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959 to streamline the process of declaring dividends, by enabling the Board of the Commonwealth Bank to declare dividends without seeking shareholder approval at a general meeting. This is consistent with the practice of other major banks. The Treasurer will continue to approve the amount of the Commonwealth Bank's dividend payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, Part 4 of the Bill amends the Reserve Bank Act 1959 to provide for the creation of a second Deputy Governor position in the Reserve Bank. This will assist the Reserve Bank's prudential supervision of the banking system and is consistent with a recommendation of the Parliamentary Inquiry into Banking. The second Deputy Governor will also participate in the management of the Reserve Bank and will be a member of the Reserve Bank Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the adjournment debate to express some concern about a matter which came before the chamber today. I understand that Senator Spindler tabled reports of the inquiry entitled `Parliamentary Inquiry into Tariffs and Industry Development'. This matter and the activities of Senator Spindler in relation to this inquiry had been brought to my attention and a constituent sent me a copy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Warrnambool Standard</EMPHASIS> which some weeks earlier had headlined a story, `Parliament's tariff probe starts in Warrnambool'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Being a member of the Senate and a member of the Parliament, I was intrigued that there was apparently a parliamentary inquiry looking into tariffs. My memory was there was no such parliamentary inquiry into tariffs at all. On further inquiry, the information I received confirmed my original view and the view expressed by a constituent that there was no such parliamentary inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Spindler tabled these reports today on this so-called parliamentary inquiry, I thought it was worthy of a closer look to see what issue and matters were raised by them. This is not a parliamentary inquiry. This is not an inquiry launched by this Parliament, voted on and agreed to by this Parliament. This is a private inquiry that Senator Spindler has launched. Senator Spindler is no doubt perfectly entitled to launch any private inquiry he wants. He is perfectly entitled to go around the country seeking the views of people about issues and he is perfectly entitled to seek the views of industry and union groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one has any argument on that, but it is not a parliamentary inquiry. As I said, Senator Spindler is free to call it what he likes, but to call it a parliamentary inquiry is to give his particular political activities a status that they do not legally have and that they should not have. For Senator Spindler to try to clothe his political activities in the garments and the prestige of this Parliament is quite wrong, in my view, and it is important that this be brought to the attention of this Parliament. Many people undoubtedly came before this so-called inquiry and, judging from this report that Senator Spindler has tabled, a number of industry groups came before it. I would hate to think that they felt this was a parliamentary inquiry. I understand the inquiry has two members: Senator Spindler and Mr Phil Cleary, MP, the honourable member for Wills. The secretary of the inquiry is Ms Lesley Vick. I happen to know Ms Vick. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;She is a former staffer of the Democrats, as Senator Knowles points out. I am sure she is a most worthy person, but she is not a person employed or paid for by the Parliament. Senator Spindler belongs to a party that used to have the slogan `Keeping the bastards honest'. I would have thought that a man who runs on that sort of slogan would have been far more cautious about trying to fool people on the nature and status of this inquiry. I regard this as quite a serious matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding is that Senator Spindler is perfectly entitled to call his inquiries what he likes. But, in my view, we have here an attempt to fool people, an attempt to clothe his inquiries with the prestige and standing of this Parliament. I believe that what Senator Spindler has done is quite wrong. He has done a disservice to this Parliament and to his own party by pretending to give this inquiry a status which it did not have. Worst of all, he has done a great disservice to the people who came before this inquiry who may well have felt that the submissions that they made had some particular standing because they went before this inquiry but, as I have pointed out, it does not have that standing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler's behaviour in this matter is quite serious. It is important that I bring this to the attention of this chamber. Whereas Senator Spindler will undoubtedly argue that he was free to call this inquiry what he wanted to, I believe that people who are concerned with giving a correct impression to others, people who are concerned about doing the right thing, not only by this Parliament, but also by the people who appear before the inquiry, would not have acted in the manner that Senator Spindler has acted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish, at this stage, in view of the late hour, to comment on the substance of this report, although there are certainly a number of matters which I wish to raise. I say to Senator Spindler that if he is concerned about the status of industry in this country; if he is concerned in particular about the status of manufacturing industry, why would he adopt policies&mdash;which he has long advocated&mdash;of higher taxation on industry and the superannuation levy which adds to business costs?  Also, he has voted consistently in this chamber for things such as the training guarantee levy which adds to business costs; he has supported the amalgamation of trade unions, which has been greatly opposed by all sections of industry in this country; he has proposed in his alternative budget&mdash;which he described as the alternative vision for Australia&mdash;a raft of taxes which totalled some $6.4 billion more than the taxpayer was currently paying. They included higher fuel taxes, transport taxes and energy taxes. All of these things have a direct impact on business costs. Let us face it: it is a stunt for Senator Spindler to go around pretending that he is concerned about business, about the capacity of business to compete, when he supports such policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that what we saw was a stunt. It was an inquiry, in my view, improperly named. Senator Spindler has for so long advocated higher taxes in this country and has opposed most of the major micro reforms in this country. I instance the need&mdash;to which even the Labor Party has woken up, albeit belatedly and altogether too slowly&mdash;for privatisation of government business activities. Senator Spindler has relentlessly opposed all of those micro reforms. It is absurd for Senator Spindler to have presented such a report to this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to address the issues of tariffs as they apply to the vehicle industry and add my direct call for the maintenance of a 15 per cent tariff rate until the year 2000. As a former secretary of the South Australian branch of the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation, I understand the importance of providing a good economic environment for manufacturing to exist in. It has been a long held view in South Australia, from all sides of politics, that government must provide tariff protection for vital industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In South Australia, the vehicle industry is vital. The major vehicle production plants make up only part of South Australia's reliance upon the overall industry. Vehicle component manufacturing industries are also significant to the growth of our economy. The policies of this Government are supportive of the restructuring of industry and increased productivity and flexibility in the workplace. Rather than being doctrinaire like the Opposition, the Government has endorsed the notion of a free market as important but not necessarily paramount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian alternative to conservative economic rationalism, experienced around the world in the 1980s, has been obvious through the maintenance of some key areas of protection. We recognise the need for an internationally competitive economy but we are not willing to compromise our basic belief in human dignity and social support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr McLachlan, the Opposition industry spokesperson, brings with him many ideas which have already been tried in other economies and have failed. He also brings with him a number of other ideas that have not been tried because they would clearly be economically destructive. Zero tariffs in the vehicle industry is such a suicidal measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one can say that Labor has taken the easy decisions; we have reduced tariffs in the interests of greater competitiveness, but we will not destroy vital manufacturing and primary industries by cutting all protection out. The tariff debate has highlighted the great distinction between the Labor and non-Labor Parties today. As the Liberals and Nationals try to keep the dissension within their own ranks to a minimum, the conservative leadership is being shown for what it really is&mdash;out of touch with the Australian people and their needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a senator representing the people of South Australia, it is my duty to stand up for the economic interests of my State. Not only will zero tariffs hurt South Australia, but the entire nation will lose out. Along with Victoria, we may rely on actual vehicle production, but there are many other workers and businesses that rely on the success of vehicle manufacturing and domestic car sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tariffs are very important to the continued economic growth of South Australia. The problems that our State may have can only be exacerbated by the proposed reduction of tariffs to zero. I urge all other South Australian senators and members in another place to stand up for our manufacturing base and support the Government's position. Any South Australian who will not support the interests of fellow South Australians does not deserve to serve in this place. I would say that this goes for Victorians as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating Government is totally committed to ensuring the viability of the Australian vehicle industry. By improving and enhancing the Button car plan, which directed vehicle industry policy in the 1980s, I know that we can see our vision become a reality. By the year 2000, we must have in place reasonable protection for the vehicle industry. The Labor Party is committed to a tariff level of 15 per cent, which is acceptable to the manufacturers and to workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motor vehicle industry employs one-fifth of all the industrial workers in South Australia and around 15 per cent of the metropolitan work force. It is therefore imperative that this industry is given the opportunity to survive the latest round of conservative attacks. I have no problem with making industry more efficient. Indeed, I have been 100 per cent behind my Party's aims to do that over the past 10 years. What I cannot stomach is the assertion that by cutting protection to zero levels we will make the vehicle industry more efficient. There is a lot of difference between zero and 15 and I believe that it is the difference between having a car industry and losing it. Not only do I think this, but so do General Motors, Mitsubishi, Ford and Toyota; so do component manufacturers, car workers, their unions and business leaders; and, judging by the polls, so do the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a community, we must face a number of facts about the continued existence of a car industry. It is pretty obvious that there will never be an international free market as long as other countries continue to maintain protection for their industries. The Button car plan has been in existence since 1985. It has aimed to ensure that a strong local industry exists in the face of overseas opposition. It has been continually monitored and adjusted to meet the changes that have occurred in the economy and the industry itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the plan itself, there have been other complementary policies. For example, the recent decision to impose a $12,000 tariff upon second-hand imported vehicles was aimed at protecting the Australian market from dumping. The Industry Commission report of 1990-91 and the subsequent March 1991 economic statement pointed out the perceived need to reduce vehicle tariffs from 35 per cent to 15 per cent by the year 2000. Therefore, while this sector is the recipient of tariff protection, it will have to undergo major changes to maintain its current position. Already Nissan has decided to leave and there could be other casualties within the industry. However, the fact is that all remaining manufacturers are keen to make a go of it under the present arrangements. We just cannot change the rules and expect people still to invest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Button car plan is an indicator of the high motives of this Labor Government. It recognises the special needs of the vehicle sector and the role that it can and will play in the creation of the clever country. Its basic concept revolves around the fact that, if we want a vehicle industry, we have to ensure its survival. It accepts that we can produce a quality product; that we can benefit from the investment in technology and infrastructure; and that we can forge an export market for ourselves, as we are doing. As a major employer and trainer of Australian workers, the vehicle industry is a national treasure that must be preserved in the interests of Australian manufacturing and technology. The jobs in this sector require skills and commitment that can only benefit our economy. The national interest is best served as far as the car industry is concerned by the continuing involvement of government in the process of development and control of this sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to be associated with my Caucus colleagues who several weeks ago in another place spoke in support of the South Australian vehicle industry. As well, I wish to convey my thanks and support to the vehicle industry unions who have also been the key to ensuring a viable and successful vehicle industry for Australia. I ask all Australians to examine carefully the proposals put forward by the Opposition. I know that if people recognise that the vehicle industry could disappear under the Liberals, they will not vote for them. This industry is very important to a great many Australians. I also know that, when examined, the GST and the Victorian model industrial relations policy supported by Dr Hewson will also be rejected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight on the adjournment, I rise to speak on Jobsback and to spell out a few things quite clearly to the people on the other side of this chamber, who have an enormous capacity to misrepresent the position of Jobsback and to then misinform the Australian public. Also, when commenting on that, one must take into account what Senator Foreman has just said, once again totally misleading this chamber and, of course, the Australian people with regard to the Opposition's position as far as the car industry is concerned. I throw this challenge down to Senator Foreman: if he is really serious about what he has just said, he will move immediately to convince his colleagues that the removal of payroll tax, wholesale sales tax and fuel excise and other initiatives in the Fightback package would not only keep the car industry in Australia but also enable it to grow and be far more healthy. However, that is not what I came in here to talk about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday in the House of Representatives both Mr Keating, the Prime Minister, and Mr Willis, the Minister for Finance, in answering questions misrepresented the position which exists in Jobsback as far as minimum employment conditions are concerned. In a moment or two I will come to the detail of what they said yesterday. Also, in the debate on the urgency motion yesterday, Senator Childs misrepresented the position&mdash;and I did inform him I would be speaking on this matter tonight. Senator Childs said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the difference between their classification rate and the lowest base rate in the award is significant. It would be financially devastating for them. This is not worker friendly; there is no way it can be. For example, the minimum award rate for a metal industry trades person would fall from $417.20 per week, including supplementary payments, to $284.80 per week with no supplementary payments.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to make it quite clear that the minima, in fact, will be the classification rates. That is the position we had at the last election with our industrial relations policy. While there have been some changes in that policy, in this particular area there has been no change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would certainly give Senator Childs the benefit of the doubt and say that he genuinely misunderstood the position which existed. I certainly cannot give the same benefit of the doubt to either Mr Keating or Mr Willis as they consistently misrepresent policy positions of the coalition; they have become artists at doing so. I think it is quite tragic when they misrepresent the position, trying to shoot down what is a very good policy&mdash;one which will lead to productivity increases from which in turn will flow increases in real wages. As I said, I will give Senator Childs the benefit of the doubt. Nonetheless, he is totally wrong in what he said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to put the record absolutely straight and to clear up a few points on this so that there is no more misrepresentation and misinterpretation, I want to go through a number of aspects of Jobsback. First, as to the transition process, there will be three groups of employees: those who along with their employers choose to remain within the award system&mdash;that is absolutely clear; those who agree with their employers to enter workplace agreements; and those whose award employment entitlements are converted to a workplace agreement. In each of these situations, the employees' legal entitlements are protected. Those remaining in the award system will retain their status quo; nothing will change. Workplace agreements by consent&mdash;that is, employees voluntarily entering into workplace agreements&mdash;are protected by the statutory minima. These are the minimum wage, annual leave, sick leave and maternity leave. In addition, they are guaranteed public holidays. Once again, this position was misrepresented in the other place yesterday. In most cases the minima will be irrelevant since employees would not consent to enter into a workplace agreement which did not improve their existing wages and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minimum wage is the minimum hourly rate applicable to an employee according to the relevant award classification. As I have already said, that does not change the position that existed at the time of the last election. There was no intention to change it. Neither Dr Hewson nor Mr Howard&mdash;nor, for that matter, anybody else in the coalition&mdash;has said anything else. They have not indicated that it would change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minimum includes, as I have already said, any supplementary payments, but it excludes penalties, allowances and loadings. Those things will be negotiated between the parties&mdash;that is, the employer and the employees&mdash;either directly between themselves or with the respective representatives they wish to have. If the employer wishes to use its industrial or representative organisation, it may. Likewise, if employees wish to use a union, they may; or, alternatively, they can use anybody of their choosing to be the negotiator or negotiate themselves. I want to make these points absolutely crystal clear to those people on the other side of the chamber so that the nonsense that has been going on in this place over the last couple of days is corrected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I now want to put on the public record exactly what the proposal is in terms of the national youth wage and to put to bed the lie that is being perpetuated by people on the other side of the chamber. Under the coalition's minimum youth wage, 15- to 17-year-olds can earn $120 a week; that is, $120 a week after tax because of the reform we are making to the taxation system. Senator Foreman could well have taken that into account in his comments when he spoke about the future of the car industry. The Government's minimum youth wage is $125 a week gross, and $120.77 after tax. So there is that huge difference of 77c in the net pay of people who fall into that 15- to 17-year-old group. Once again, that is the minimum. The coalition policy provides in addition a non-taxable training voucher worth $2,000 over two years, the equivalent of $19 a week. Recipients of this voucher can choose the type of training they take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People on the other side of the chamber&mdash;it happened here again today at Question Time&mdash;say that we are not taking training into consideration and have made no provision for it. That is totally and utterly false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For 18- to 20-year-olds, the coalition's minimum wage is $140 a week or $139.13 after tax. The Government's minimum is $150 a week or $140.77 after tax&mdash;almost the same. But once again, in addition to that, under the coalition's policy there is the $2,000 non-taxable training voucher over two years or the equivalent of $19 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claim made in the other place yesterday by Mr Willis that the coalition's youth wage represents an extraordinary loss of protection for adolescent employees is total nonsense. It is just false; it is not true and it should be corrected. Also, as I have already mentioned, there is a safety net with regard to public holidays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now deal with the issue of casuals. Once again, it was Mr Willis who claimed yesterday that the average loading for casuals is 20 per cent. I must make the point here that we put in a minimum of 15 per cent for casuals. I must stress that that is a minimum, not an average. It is worth noting that, at this point in time, quite a number of awards do not have that 15 per cent loading over the minimum. That means that, in fact, under many awards casuals will be better off in terms of their minimum provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minimum applying to employees coming off the back of a certified agreement into a workplace agreement will be the minimum in the relevant award. Once again, that corrects the misrepresentation that has been echoed in this place and the other place. What has been said about the various minima is a total misrepresentation of the situation. It absolutely amazes me that people on the other side of the chamber continually claim they have shot holes in Jobsback. All I can say to them is that they have had to fabricate untruths to try to knock it out. Of course, in actual fact we have caught them totally off guard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were suggestions prior to the policy being released that we were going to scrub everything, that we were not going to have satisfactory safety nets in place&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Knowles has quite rightly said, `Aren't they disappointed'. They have been caught totally off guard. The safety net is indeed significant. It is fair, it protects their position, yet at the same time it allows individuals, groups of employees or a whole workplace to make their own workplace arrangements above that minimum without interference from anybody if they so choose. In other words, it ends the dominance of big unions and coercion in the workplace in this country. That is something that is well overdue. But at the same time, it gives unions and those who want to perform the opportunity to perform, to get out there and, as I have already said publicly, to win their stripes by performance in the marketplace. The same also applies to employer organisations. They will have to win their stripes if employers are going to utilise their services in industrial matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it should be made very clear that this is not an anti-union policy; it is not an anti-employer policy. It is a policy that will ensure that those who win the competitive edge in the marketplace and look after their members are the ones that will survive and grow and that those who do not will fall by the wayside. That is how it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two other points I want to raise. Once again, both of these caught the Government right off guard. The first one is the Office of the Employees' Advocate. The role of the Office of the Employees' Advocate will be to protect the interests of employees when in fact there has been a breach of contract by the employer. That service will be provided at no cost to the employee. If there is a dispute, for example, over payment, all that employee has to do is contact the Office of the Employees' Advocate and the matter will be dealt with. That, once again, caught this Government right off guard and left it wallowing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter relates to a breach of a workplace agreement by an employee. Employees can be fined a maximum of $5,000 under common law. It is a new thing in industrial relations in this nation. It applies only to the breach of that contract. It does not in any way reduce the powers of common law. It does not in any way reduce the powers of the Trade Practices Act. It does not in any way reduce the powers of the Crimes Act when in fact broader breaches occur or where blatant abuse of the law occurs. In that sense, it changes nothing that exists in law today, and nor should it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summarising my speech in the adjournment debate tonight, I emphasise once again that the Prime Minister got it wrong, Mr Willis got it wrong, Senator Childs got it wrong and, in a number of answers we have had to questions in this place from Senator Cook, he has also got it wrong. One must note when comparing our policy position to that of the failed accord of this Government that what has been delivered to the Australian work force over the years is a 2 per cent fall in real wages. That is what this Government has delivered to the Australian worker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What our policy does is give people in the workplace real hope because they can be involved in meaningful arrangements in the workplace. It gives them real hope by giving them, together with their employers&mdash;whether they be large, medium or small&mdash;an opportunity to lift productivity and enjoy an increase in real wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do not lift productivity, there is no way that there will be an increase in real wages, unless the Government is prepared to sacrifice more people onto the dole queues or it is prepared to see more businesses go bankrupt. That is the sad history of this Government and that is what its policies have delivered. This Government has delivered one million unemployed people and an increase of 25 per cent over the last two years in the number of bankruptcies in this country. The number has gone up and up as each year has gone by and has exceeded record levels. As I have already said, this Government's failed policies have delivered a 2 per cent fall in real wages to workers or employees in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I briefly wish to raise two very important issues. I was encouraged to raise the first matter as I listened with some interest to Senator Foreman's rather curious speech about the car industry in South Australia. If Senator Foreman genuinely believes what he says, why does he not stop any tariff reductions and move somewhere in this Parliament or in Caucus that there be no tariff reductions? If what he said in his rather interesting speech was correct, one wonders why he would support any tariff reductions at all. I inquire about that and invite him to elucidate at some time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Foreman is genuinely concerned about the reduction, he might also indicate when he will get his Party and the current Government to introduce legislation to remove payroll tax, the training guarantee levy, petrol taxes and those sorts of things from the motor vehicle industry. If he were to do that, it would be a real boost to the motor vehicle industry and would certainly be a great incentive for it to continue in operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter that I want to raise is the Government's proposal to extend the fringe benefits tax to car parking. I recently had the opportunity of visiting several local authorities in Victoria. I spoke with the City of Melbourne council and listened to its very great concern about the extension of the fringe benefits tax to include car parking. The extension of the fringe benefits tax to car parking will increase costs for businesses located in the central business district of Melbourne. This will have a real effect on that area in that it will further underutilise existing urban infrastructure in the central city areas, which is a real concern with public planning at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the extension of the fringe benefits tax to car parking will impose significant compliance costs on many businesses throughout Australia. Employers will be required to maintain records of parking benefits provided and to calculate values and the tax payable on those values. FBT returns are due annually and employers must pay quarterly. Employers will need to keep records of car parking bays made available and their usage, which includes weekdays and weekends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers will also have to keep records of the lowest fee charged by commercial parking stations within one kilometre of their parking facility. They will have to be involved in the reimbursement of parking expenses incurred by their employees. They will also have to keep records of whether the parking expenses qualify for any concessional treatment. So the compliance costs for business will be very significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arbitrary one kilometre rule will also result in some suburban and fringe CBD businesses becoming liable for the FBT while some neighbouring competitors will not be liable. It will again create distortions. A number of people working in private hospitals, airports, schools and factories will have to pay the charge. This is considered very harsh. A number of night shift workers, who for security and safety reasons are provided with this facility, will be caught. There may be no negligible market rates for parking at night in contrast to daily rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FBT on car parking is an impost which will predominantly hurt city businesses. In Melbourne at present, which is suffering from years of corrupt and inefficient Labor rule, $240m is already paid in property taxes by businesses in the central business district. Some taxes paid include the State Government land tax, Melbourne water rates, the Melbourne City Council rates, a special levy for commercial properties and for the underground rail loop. Most of that expenditure bears very little real relationship to the central city area. The FBT on car parking will add to this, increasing the level of imposts and reducing the viability of many CBD businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government claims that it will raise $120m from the introduction of the FBT. A third of this is likely to come from the CBD of Melbourne and the adjacent areas of south Carlton and South Melbourne. This will mean an extra burden of about $40m on city businesses on top of the $240m already levied. Quite simply, such an impost can be expected to have an impact on the decision by businesses to locate outside the CBD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, your government professes to be putting major programs in place to stimulate economic growth, but the FBT on car parking will hinder rather than assist recovery. In fact, the weight of taxes in the CBD has been recognised. The City of Melbourne has reduced its commercial rates quite significantly by $15m, and there is pressure to reduce the State land tax. The Federal Government's decision to add costs to CBD businesses runs contrary to that approach and makes all the efforts of the Melbourne City Council to reduce costs quite illusory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, the underutilisation of the inner city infrastructure is quite serious. The introduction of the fringe benefits tax will add to the already high volumes of vacant office space in the city. It will have the effect of undermining the work of city revitalisation, in which the City of Melbourne council has already been very heavily involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will also create environmental problems in that there will be a decrease in public transport patronage. As businesses move out of the central business district into suburban areas&mdash;where public transport is not quite as good and where the suburban thoroughfares are not designed to handle that sort of traffic&mdash;there will be a greater increase in traffic via private cars. Some surveys show that it will lead to a substantial increase in the use of private cars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some survey work was done when Coles-Myer relocated out of the city area. It was found that there was an increase in private vehicle trips from 34 per cent to 76 per cent and a decline in public transport usage from 30 per cent to 10 per cent. So there are some serious environmental implications in this tax. Further, the compliance costs and unintended distortions that will be caused will be unfortunate, to say the least. The tax is very complex and the requirements it imposes on business are extremely onerous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The City of Melbourne, along with some other interested groups, has made a submission to the Government on this matter. I urge the Government seriously to consider the very persuasive arguments of the City of Melbourne and others in this submission about the fringe benefits tax on car parking. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Commonwealth is awaiting a final response from NSW to a financial proposal forwarded earlier this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) There are two major aspects to this question: (a) arrangements for the treatment of veterans; (b) staffing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of (a), the Commonwealth has done considerable work to ensure the successful implementation of the Repatriation Private Patient Scheme as soon as the hospital is integrated. All eligible veterans in NSW have been informed by mail of the proposed scheme, which is already operating successfully in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of (b), officer level negotiations on agreed <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">arrangements for staff are well underway, and are expected to be finalised after there is agreement on financial arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes; agreement with NSW has been more difficult to achieve than was envisaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) No decision has been made on this issue. The best outcome for veterans would be early integration of the hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, Mr Howe, issued a Press Release on 13 May 1992, advising that the Commonwealth had offered more than one billion dollars to guarantee the rights of veterans to access high quality services in New South Wales hospitals following integration of RGH Concord into the State health system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then NSW Minister for Health, Mr Hannaford, in a Press Release the same day referred to five years funding and an asset value of $200 million, making a total of one billion dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth's offer is generous, and will assist NSW to rationalise its health services. However, it is not appropriate or possible for me to comment on the costs which would be incurred by the State of NSW as a result of the transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7)(a) The level of veteran bed utilisation will depend upon a number of factors including medical referral practices, changing length of stay, and underlying veteran demographic parameters. Current volume in RGH Concord and public hospitals is around 48000 admissions/separations p.a. and 340,000 bed days. Some "Medicare shift" (i.e. veterans in public hospitals not currently using their DVA entitlements due to their preference for local treatment) is expected to occur, but offsetting this may be increased use of private hospitals due to the inability of local public hospitals to provide appropriate facilities in a reasonable time. On this basis, the forecast number of public hospital bed days in the first three years after integration is estimated at:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">361,000</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">369,000</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">376,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is scope for significant variation around these levels due to the volatility of the factors which influence bed demand, as outlined above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Again, it is not appropriate or possible for me to comment on the costs which would be incurred by the State of NSW as a result of the transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) Community patients accounted for approximately 42% of bed days in RGH Concord in 1991-92. On a proportional basis, therefore, operating costs attributable to community patients would be of the order of $66.6m. However, the cost benefit to the State of the integration of Concord, and the costs attributable to it, could only be estimated by the State Government. Presumably they would be taking into account factors such as obtaining a well equipped modern teaching hospital facility at no capital cost.</PARA>
