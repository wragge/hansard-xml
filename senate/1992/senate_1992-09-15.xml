<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer the Minister to his comments quoted on 20 August in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> when, in defence of his Government's secret tax plans, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we'll be going into the election saying is that we don't believe we will have to do this, but if we. . . down the track, are in a situation where the economy has not grown to the extent which we believe it will, then we would have at that time to consider the question of expanding or extending some existing taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>Is it not a fact that at the time the Minister made that statement he knew that these additional taxes had already been decided on and that they were already detailed in the draft of the August Budget, from which they were withdrawn? Why did the Minister mislead the public with this answer as quoted in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has stated on a number of occasions that it would announce any details of any proposed tax changes before the next election, which is more than the Opposition will do. The possibility of the three taxes being introduced was announced in the Budget Papers. The Government's decision and legislation will be introduced by the Treasurer tomorrow. No decision was made by the revenue committee to introduce the three changes to the tax system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has learnt, I think, from the public horror at the GST proposal and has hidden the details of its GST and other taxes. It has yet to answer the Treasurer's call for details. I hope the Opposition will make more information available before the election, or will it let Sir William Cole's secret GST office, staffed by the big accounting firms, determine the taxes? Senator Hill knows what it wanted to tax; it wanted to tax non-prescription drugs, artificial limbs, hearing aids, wheelchairs and crutches&mdash;more purist ideology on the human factors. When that leaked out, the Opposition had to exclude the lot from the GST list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What else does the GST office have in mind that the Opposition wants to keep secret until after the next election? There are numerous taxes which could be imposed, of course, on all sorts of things from swimming lessons to school excursions, the food component of school boarding fees, bicycle helmets, school uniforms, wedding rings&mdash;a whole lot. We heard all about this in the Senate in relation to the wholesale sales tax and now we are starting to hear about it in relation to the GST.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Is the Minister aware of a recent enterprise agreement negotiated by SPC management, workers and unions in Shepparton, Victoria? Could the Minister provide the Senate with some of the detail of that agreement?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="859" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS; SHIPPING AND AVIATION SUPPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of a recently concluded workplace agreement negotiated at the Shepparton Preserving Company between the management, the unions covering the workers involved and the workers at that establishment. It is an agreement similar to the one negotiated in 1991 with SPC. The agreement is a win-win outcome; it is a win for the employers and a win for the unions and the workers that those unions represent. The agreement will introduce into that company a degree of profit sharing and it will introduce a consultative committee to sort out management-worker conflict&mdash;a consultative committee comprising management, workers and their unions. It is an agreement that will introduce a degree of flexibility in terms of the taking of rostered days off, and a career structure and new classification structure which will simplify the old more complicated classification structure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an example of our industrial relations policy working. This agreement is currently before the Industrial Relations Commission for endorsement. It is not an example of the Opposition's big bang theory, by which it wants to turf everyone right out of the industrial relations system and it would be possible to get back into it only with the agreement of the other party. This is an example of a company and its workers working together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are now several hundred such agreements in Australia. The silent revolution we are seeing in industrial relations in Australia is typified by this agreement and by many others. It is being achieved cooperatively, without dispute. It is not the old industrial relations policy that honourable senators opposite presided over during the Fraser years and would wish to reintroduce, were they ever to have the chance of occupying the treasury bench. I commend it as a good example of the sort of workplace agreement now taking place around Australia.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Could the Minister inform the Senate how the agreement was negotiated and whether it will be taken to the AIRC for ratification? Would the Minister describe the agreement at SPC as an example of the coalition's industrial relations policy in action?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="859" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS; SHIPPING AND AVIATION SUPPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not describe it as an example of the coalition's industrial relations policy in action at all. I know Mr Howard and Dr Hewson have stumped around this country pretending that the SPC agreement is an example of their industrial relations policy. Nothing could be further from the truth. That is a total misrepresentation of the facts. It is an agreement that operates within and through our system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, it was an agreement negotiated by the management and the unions on behalf of the workers concerned. It should be noted for the record that the SPC management has been full of praise for the role that the ACTU played in these negotiations and for the cooperative approach of the unions in meeting the particular needs of that company. I think it is currently before the Industrial Relations Commission for ratification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that the role of the Industrial Relations Commission here is to ensure that this is a fair agreement. It has to look at the criterion that an agreement does not lower conditions below those provided for in minimum rate awards of the Commission. So it has to be fair to the people it covers. The Commission, in considering an agreement, has to be sure that the people covered by it feel bound by it and will honour it, and it has to be sure that there is a dispute settling procedure built into the agreement. In other words, it has to be a fair and reasonable agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has to be contrasted to the Howard-Hewson Kennett-Gude view of industrial relations in which it is the law of the jungle&mdash;the strong will prevail while the weak will suffer, the exploiters will overcome the exploitees and there will be no standards at all to ensure elementary fairness. Our approach to resolving industrial matters is a best and fairest approach. It provides the best economic outcomes and the fairest results for all concerned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer, as did Senator Hill, to Labor's secret taxes, the details of which were withdrawn from the Budget in a last minute decision. I ask the Minister: as a leading member of the Government's key revenue committee, was he involved in the decision to excise the details from the Budget? If not, was it solely the decision of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer in another deliberate attempt to conspire to hold the truth from the Australian people?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The assumption about all this is wrong&mdash;that the details were excised, as Senator Short puts it, from the Budget. If that assumption is wrong, the rest of the question falls apart. In the Budget Papers, as Senator Short well knows, there were references to several taxes. It is stated clearly that the Government would consider reforms to the domestic interest withholding tax, the scope of the prescribed payments system and the fringe benefits tax system. In the circumstances in which I have outlined and which are described fairly well by what I said in Melbourne a few weeks ago, which Senator Hill quoted from in his question, those things were mentioned in the Budget documents. In so far as they go, the Treasurer will be making a statement about that tomorrow.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button. The Government has made it clear that it rejects proposals for a goods and services tax in Australia. Can the Minister inform the Senate whether the Government examined the position of small business in reaching its position on such proposals? What effect would such a tax have on the majority of small businesses in this country?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an important issue. I recall that it was raised by Senator Short as long ago as 1977 when he was contesting the seat of Ballarat. He drew attention to the difficulties which, for example, the abolition of payroll tax would have for small businesses at that time. The point of the question is that small business would be amongst the biggest losers under a goods and services tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in the hands of the most articulate Opposition spokesmen&mdash;and there are not too many of them&mdash;the goods and services tax revolves around a trade-off between the new tax paid for the abolition and the reduction of other taxes. This is something which small business will oppose. People running small businesses have to ask themselves how many of the taxes which would be abolished under Fightback or any other GST proposal they actually pay. This was the point Senator Short was making some years ago. There are 830,000 businesses in Australia. Most of these are small businesses. All of them would have to fill out GST forms. Compare that with the number of people who currently have to handle the paperwork generated by other taxes such as payroll tax and wholesale sales tax. Of all our businesses, more than 700,000 of those 830,000 do not pay payroll tax.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. In view of the answer that Senator Button gave, can he compare the impact on employment of a payroll tax and a GST which would replace it?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="861" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Payroll tax is an emotive matter, and it has been for many years. It is often described as a tax on employment. There are different arguments about that. The Opposition tries to compare itself with the rest of the world; it should look at the equivalent taxes which are paid in Europe and North America in respect of employment of labour.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why does not Senator Macdonald shut up for a minute, instead of interjecting all the time. Abolishing payroll tax and replacing it with a GST is not a sensible response. In fact, a GST is a much heavier burden on employment because a GST is a tax on the value added of labour, each step up the productive chain. It is a distraction. It has been elevated to crucial importance by the Opposition. It is essentially a switch in the tax base from income to expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a centrepiece of a policy which assumes, wrongly, that industry competitiveness is driven exclusively by price related factors. It is a magic wand policy and magic wands do not work in the real world. The whole issue of the impact of GST and the Fightback proposal on industry is that Fightback just assumes that the competitiveness of industry is related entirely to price factors. Everybody out there in industry land knows that that is not so. The Opposition's narrow ideological commitment, which enables its Leader to see through a keyhole with both eyes at one time, has led it down this silly accountants' track.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Firstly, has Japan approached Australia to ask that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Akatsugi Maru</EMPHASIS>, which will soon ship one tonne of plutonium from France to Japan, be allowed to enter Australian waters or receive Australian assistance, including in an emergency? If so, what was the Government's response? Secondly, do Government assessments confirm that the use of plutonium in mixed oxide fuels for Japan's thermal nuclear power plants could be constrained by high costs, thus creating a substantial plutonium stockpile? Thirdly, does the Government accept that the growing trend towards separation, transportation and stockpiling of plutonium poses a serious threat to the non-proliferation regime, which has already lost credibility for its failure to prevent the illegal nuclear weapons programs of such countries as Iraq, Israel, India and Pakistan?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="862" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that Senator Coulter appreciates it is a pretty tall order to get any kind of sensible answer to all that in two minutes, but I will do my best.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Japan has not asked Australia for assistance but it has advised us, and it has also stated publicly, that the shipments of plutonium from Europe to Japan will not, in principle, be routed through other countries' 200 nautical miles exclusive economic zones, nor will they make scheduled port calls. For security reasons, Japan will keep the routes of these shipments confidential. If emergency circumstances were to arise in the course of a shipment and Japan requested Australia's assistance, including access to Australian territorial waters, the Australian Government would consider such a request in accordance with the international law that is applicable to ships in distress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the second question, Japan does have longstanding plans for a nuclear fuel recycling program, of which one element is the use of plutonium in mixed oxide fuels and light water reactors. The Japanese Government remains committed to that recycling program as part of its policy of reducing dependence on energy imports. It does not seem to be dissuaded unduly by the economics of it. The Australian Government would not support the stockpiling by Japan or, for that matter, any other non-nuclear weapon state of plutonium in excess of that required for its energy program. On that point, we are reassured by Japan's clear and frequent statements that as a fundamental principle it will not possess plutonium beyond the amount required for nuclear electricity generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the last question, the rate of plutonium separation and the use of that plutonium is increasing but not at anything like the rate which was forecast 20 years ago when there were predictions that plutonium would replace enriched uranium as the main nuclear fuel. Separated plutonium does pose nuclear non-proliferation risks, but these have long been recognised and measures have been taken with the IAEA safeguard system to develop and implement appropriate safeguards for the reprocessing and utilisation of plutonium. There are also strict guidelines, as Senator Coulter should be aware, on plutonium transportation and physical protection.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that is code, as Senator Ray suggests, for answering the rest of the question. I do not have an answer to that bit in the paper in front of me. I will check that out and advise Senator Coulter. I am not aware of any specific consultation but there may well have been such. If there has been, I will confirm that one way or the other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth saying, though, in answer to some of the suggestions in the first part of Senator Coulter's question that the non-proliferation regime has not, as he asserted, lost credibility. The disclosures of Iraq's clandestine nuclear program obviously did reveal some areas where the regime needed to be strengthened. But in the last year, the international community has taken a number of measures to achieve that objective, particularly in regard to the strengthening of safeguards and the tightening of nuclear export controls.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am well aware of the views of different Australian communities of Balkan origin because I have talked to their representatives on a regular basis, as have a number of other Ministers. It is quite clear from these discussions that members of Australia's Serbian community in particular are concerned at Serbia's portrayal in the media as `the guilty party' in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. They are particularly concerned that this could lead to what they refer to as the `demonisation' of Serbs in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say that it is certainly not the intention of the Australian Government to cast any of the Australian-Balkan communities in a poor light. To the contrary, I strongly believe that all members of those communities are to be very warmly congratulated for their restraint and maturity, as has been shown in their reaction to the tragic conflict in their homeland. Apart from what have really been a few isolated incidents, their moderate conduct does speak volumes for the success of Australian multiculturalism because these communities do act as Australians first, and have not transferred these ancient disputes to their new homeland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, I have to say that we have not shirked our international obligations. Government statements have pointed out that all sides in the conflict must bear some of the responsibility for these tragic developments. But we have also accepted the judgment that has been widely made in the international community that the Serbian side probably does carry a principal responsibility for the continuation of that conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the United Nations Security Council decided that Serbia-Montenegro were in breach of the UN charter's obligations and mandatory sanctions were imposed, Australia did, of course, take the necessary action and continues to do so.

Why had the question of importing pigs from Denmark been given top priority by AQIS in the quarantine protocols when the pig industry's view, as admitted by AQIS in its January 1992 annual report, was that if AQIS persists with the question of live pig imports, priority should be given to the UK, Eire and North America as a source of these animals?

Let me give this clear response: if someone wants to move a second motion to take note of a supplementary answer, that is a second motion and that person can speak to that for two minutes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, the coalition agrees with the general thrust of the motion but we have considerable difficulty with some aspects of it. First of all, I refer to the question of the right of senators to take note of answers. Whilst acknowledging Senator McMullan's admission that leave would not be denied, we believe that logic would dictate that for a motion such as this, senators, as of right, should be able to take note of Ministers' answers. Therefore, we would propose that the preamble to the three conditions should read: `That for as long as the current limitations on the length of time for questions and answers in Question Time are in force, senators shall be entitled to move a motion to take note of Ministers' answers to questions without notice in accordance with the following conditions (a), (b) and (c)'. We will be moving that amendment to the motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three conditions in the Government's motion. The first one is that motions shall relate only to answers given to questions without notice that day. That does impose a considerable inhibition and limitation on the ability of senators to take note of Ministers' answers. It is not uncommon for relevant material required by a senator who wants to take note of a Minister's answer not to be available immediately after Question Time or immediately after a Minister gives his answer. Therefore, a senator may not be in the position until at least the following day to take note of an answer in an intelligent way and to give the type of response that is required. So I believe that this part of the motion does impose an unnecessary limitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second condition is that a senator may speak for no more than two minutes on such a motion. Two minutes is a very short time to respond to an answer from a Minister because the response to answers is a very different kettle of fish to Question Time itself. It lends itself to some debate because more than one senator may wish to participate in the debate to take note of an answer. Therefore, we believe that two minutes is far too short. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will move for four minutes. Ideally, I think it should be longer, but I understand that the Democrats may be prepared to support a proposal that the two minutes be amended to four. I will be moving that because I think it is important to get a shift from two minutes. Four minutes is logical in the sense that Ministers now, in fact, have four minutes to answer questions if they are given&mdash;or seek, if it is a dorothy dixer&mdash;a supplementary question. They get two plus two minutes. Therefore, at the very least, I think the senator taking note of the answer should be given up to four minutes to respond to the answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third condition that the Government has laid down in its proposal is that the total time for debate on all motions relating to answers to questions without notice on any day shall not exceed 30 minutes. We believe that that is too short a time. We fully accept the Government's intent and wish that there be at least some limitation put on the length of time for which such procedure can operate, but 30 minutes is a very short period of time. Even on the basis of yesterday's Question Time, when we had 33 or 34 questions, of which about 24 were original questions and 10 or 12 were supplementaries, at a maximum of four minutes for each speaker, 30 minutes allows for only seven speakers. So even if there were only one speaker taking note of each answer, at most, only one-third of the answers could be responded to. I believe that that is too short. Therefore, I will be moving on behalf of the coalition that `30 minutes' should read `60 minutes'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure how Senator McMullan is proposing to handle this. I presume&mdash;and I recommend&mdash;that he may wish to take this part by part. If that is so, I commend those comments to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as Senator Harradine's remarks are concerned, he is a pretty fast talker; I think he already has an advantage over most of us. Perhaps we should be moving a motion in due course to cut Senator Harradine's 30-minute speech time down to 25 on the basis that he can speak 10 per cent faster than the rest of us. His comment was offered facetiously, I am sure, and mine is in response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the coalition, I respond to the Government's motion in those terms. If it is Senator McMullan's understanding, after due debate, we will take this on a segment by segment basis. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, in relation to whether responses relate to questions of that day or questions asked earlier, I believe that, as a trial, it is appropriate that it be limited to questions of the day.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike the Senator from South Australia who is provoking me, I have a reputation for crossing the floor on State matters and on matters of conscience and on a whole range of issues. I have crossed the floor more times than anyone else in this chamber, save perhaps for our current Leader. Senator Schacht may well have a view, but it is restricted to sitting on his butt over there&mdash;temporarily over there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a time when there was an unlimited Question Time in this chamber. As I remember, the time limit was put on Question Time by Lionel Murphy when he was getting such a doing over from Reg Withers and Ivor Greenwood. The number of questions that are historically being asked during Question Time is, I think, 28. Senator Kemp is the authority on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we now have the four minute proposal and the two minute proposal is that there has been an absolute abuse of the forms, the procedures, the niceties, the delicacies and the decencies of this chamber. The reason those opposite have what they have is that they cannot do the right thing inside the right rules. There is no need, because of their indolence and stupidity and poor tactics, for those opposite to extend it into the general debate. I remind them that they have seen an increase in recent times of motions to take note of answers to questions without notice as a substitute for MPIs. I am very happy to have an MPI three days a week, and we will take our 120 minutes. We will all take as much time as we are entitled to. There probably will not be so many motions to take note of answers, but we will have the same debate in a different form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We thought we would give a bit of light and shade and&mdash;as the Government's Leader would say&mdash;dash and flair to the chamber and do it a different way. So this is seen to be some clever Dick trick to gag this chamber. Under this proposal we will go from having 30 minutes in which to speak to two minutes. We presently have five minutes at the very least because, in the event that the Government refuses to give leave, we can move for the suspension of Standing Orders under the contingent notice of motion that is sitting there and we can debate that for five minutes. The question of the relevancy is another issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is proposing that we take three minutes out of the five which would leave us with two. In real terms, when leave is granted, we have 30 minutes. So what those opposite are proposing is that we gut the debate by 28 minutes. I have always felt passionately that this is a chamber of second deliberation and consideration and contemplation. Unlike the House of Representatives, this is not the Executive's chamber. I see that the Democrats are laughing; I know not why because this is a chamber where debate and consideration can change the course and the outcome of legislation and of votes. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard the other day that half the senators who are here are here under some sort of duress.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course I support Senator Short's amendment to make the time restriction four minutes, which I understand is likely to be supported by the Democrats, but I do it with a great deal of reluctance. As Senator Short said, there is a great deal of difference between answering a question that requires a simple `yes' or `no', or answering a question in four minutes, which may only take two minutes if proper dedication were put to its substance; and a debate on the manner of a response, the substance of a response and the relevance of a response. To imagine, in some perverse way, that four minutes for the question and four minutes for the debate are equal, is like comparing apples with oranges. It is not logical to me, although it seems to me that the Government is trying to kick a goal to cheer up its own side. This proposal has no merit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, like my colleague Senator Crichton-Browne, support the amendment moved by Senator Short. It is a pity that this debate has come on. Taking note of an answer to a question has been one of the most effective innovations in this chamber over the last year. Its effectiveness is such that the Government now wants to restrict it; that is how effective it has been. In my view, we have seen in this Parliament under the Hawke-Keating governments a constant abuse of Question Time. One of the ways to redress this balance has been to take note of answers to questions, so that when Ministers ramble on during Question Time, they are required to come back and debate the issues that they have raised. My view is that this measure has been used in a responsible manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that people have spoken on this motion before the chamber but nobody seems to have pulled out any key data. For example, no-one seems to know how many of these motions have been moved and what time has been taken up with taking note of answers to questions. During the last hour I pulled out a few statistics, and I would certainly not want the chamber to assume that they are correct; they would certainly need checking.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that we have been taking note of answers in a responsible fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By and large, we have given up MPIs. MPIs typically last for around two hours. I understand that there have been 44 sitting days since the start of the year. Of those 44 sitting days, there have been 14 days on which an MPI or an urgency motion has been moved. It is fairly clear from the statistics that I have on hand and have cited that the longest time spent in taking note of answers has been around one hour and 50 minutes, which is still shorter than having a debate on an MPI or an urgency motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important when we evaluate this that we pull out all the relevant data and look closely at what has happened over the last year. I am not one for saying that things cannot be improved. I have pulled out some statistics for the last 12 or so sitting days on the time taken up with taking note of answers to questions. For example, on 18 August, 30 minutes were taken up; on 19 August, 20 minutes; on 8 September, my figures show 15 minutes; on 9 September, 42 minutes; on 10 September, no time was taken up; and on 14 September, an hour and 20 minutes. Those figures would have to be verified because I pulled them out hurriedly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> However, of those six days which I have referred to there were three on which we took MPIs and three on which we could have taken MPIs but in fact did not. So it is my view that, in an interesting way&mdash;and I put this to Senator McMullan&mdash;the taking note of answers has in fact saved time in the chamber, not the reverse. Certainly in the past I suspect we were far more inclined to use urgency motions or matters of public importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However vexatious this may appear to Government Ministers&mdash;and it is vexatious because they have to stay in the chamber, listen to their answers being debated and provide further answers; it is a pain to the Government and of that there is no question&mdash;it is one way of this chamber seeking to enforce greater accountability from Government Ministers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that Senator Human Rights does not like this, but the reality is that even Labor Ministers have to become accountable in some place and at some time for their actions. In my view, this chamber by and large does its job fairly well. I think it is important that the figures be pulled out to see just what time has been taken up and how this procedure can be further improved. I agree with Senator Short: I think that, by and large, 30 minutes is too short; I think that putting a time limit of 4 minutes is too short. On the other hand, I think there is an argument for the provision of an hour after Question Time for honourable senators to take note of answers should they wish to do so. I think that it ought to be taken in conjunction with looking very closely at how often we are prepared to use the procedures of the MPI and the urgency motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I put that to you, Mr President. I think this has come on somewhat precipitously without proper consideration and evaluation of the figures involved. It has come on by and large because the Government sees Mr Keating and his Ministers down in the other chamber being all macho and protected by the Chair. However, when they come up here, it is a different ball game and Ministers have to be more accountable to the chamber. As I have said, this is a procedure which I think has been effective. It has forced more accountability onto Ministers. I would urge, before we adopt this as a permanent measure, that we look very closely at what has happened to see how it can be improved but always&mdash;and I put this particularly to Senator Coulter and his colleagues&mdash;with the central principle in mind that the principal role of this chamber is to make Ministers more accountable to the people, and we should be very wary about restricting in any way that accountability. </PARA>

Did Senator McMullan's motion not allow for note to be taken of an answer given to a question of a previous day? For example, I mention the one that Senator Kernot asked of Senator Button yesterday, to which Senator Button tabled an answer today. Would it not be possible under the rules Senator McMullan is putting down for us to seek leave to move a motion to take note of that particular answer to a question asked yesterday when that answer was tabled today?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>First let me commend the Auditor-General for the timeliness of his report on the Australian National Audit Office for the year to 30 June, dated 11 September 1992. I hope that other departments of the Government follow that excellent lead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an astounding report. It is condemnatory of the Government in some particular respects. When the Auditor-General is prepared to be as critical of the Executive as he is in this report, this Parliament should take note. I want to read a section from this report. I quote as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite continuing warnings during the year about the effects of inadequate audit and review of the management of some bodies in public sectors, I have found little understanding in some areas of the Commonwealth about the importance of public audit of public bodies and have had to report twice to the Parliament about potential erosion of public accountability.  </PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General is clearly pointing to events in Victoria, for example, where people will soon have the opportunity to judge the level of competence and the amount of public accountability in that State. But the criticism the Auditor-General makes of the Executive of the Commonwealth Parliament&mdash;of this Keating Government&mdash;is well deserved and astounding. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The mounting costs to the Australian taxpayers of some prime examples of non-Commonwealth public-sector entrepreneurial zeal&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>He could have put in brackets `particularly in Victoria'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">should in themselves have stopped such attempts at avoiding proper and effective parliamentary scrutiny in the Commonwealth. But sadly this has not been the case. There seems little comprehension of the significance of the principle of the independence of the Auditor-General, particularly from the executive arm of government.</PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely damning criticism from the Auditor-General of the Keating Government. I repeat:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There seems little comprehension of the significance of the principle of the independence of the Auditor-General, particularly from the executive arm of government.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of this attitude, I am reluctantly of the view that the future viability of the ANAO as a force for genuine improvement and proper accountability is still at risk.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Auditor-General talking about the Keating Government. It is absolutely incredible that the Government has been so cavalier in its approach to the Auditor-General that the Auditor-General felt compelled in this report to present this level of criticism of the Government. It is unprecedented to my knowledge. Other honourable senators might have a view as to whether an Auditor-General has ever felt constrained to attack the Government for its behaviour towards him and his office in such a way. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The general provisions of the Australian Public Service are not always relevant to auditors. If we have poor performers in auditing, the ANAO does not have other avenues for their productive employment. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can be at risk personally if a job is poor, but so is the ANAO, the Government, the Parliament and the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA>He is asking the Government whether it will please alter the employment environment in which his office has to act. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Auditor-General needs contract conditions to appoint auditors, with appropriate remuneration to offset the lack of tenure. The constraints imposed by the Public Service Act and associated legislation which determine the terms and conditions of employment of ANAO staff, particularly in relation to remuneration, discipline and efficiency matters, inhibit my ability to meet the ANAO's professional needs.</PARA>
<PARA>He gives this serious warning:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once the current economic environment improves, the Office will be hard pressed to retain its best performers,</PARA>
<PARA>That is, of course, if the Government does nothing to change the employment environment in which his office must operate. It gets even worse. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The potential for interference by the Executive&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Keating Government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in the staffing and operations of the ANAO is clear. The unsatisfactory results of recent inefficiency and disciplinary processes would have me employ incompetent auditors on auditing work. To do so would put me in breach of appropriate professional standards. AUS1 for example, which requires an audit to be performed and reported with due professional care by persons who have adequate training, experience and competence in auditing. . . It is professionally unacceptable to employ incompetent auditors on audits.</PARA>
<PARA>One can see the level of concern of, and the difficulties being faced by, the Auditor-General. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my report of some three years ago I reported with some enthusiasm the Government's support for the JCPA's&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Joint Committee of Public Accounts&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">recommendation that a new Act be developed setting new directions for my Office. Some four years after the Joint Committee of Public Accounts recommended its development, the reality of a new Act would still seem to be in the future. I hope that the Parliament will be put in a position soon where it will be able to put the Auditor-General's Act in place by July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA>Another slap, and an appropriate slap, at the Government. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Government has recently reduced the priority given to the passage of the legislation which may leave the Office without the support it needs in the contemporary environment.</PARA>
<PARA>One begins to wonder whether this Government really wants an effective Audit Office bringing about effective audits of this Government's activities. Clearly, I suppose, from the criticisms of the Government and many of its agencies that the Auditor-General has made, the Government perceives it to be in its best interests to do nothing to assist the Auditor-General in his vitally important job of servicing this Parliament. I want to get back to that in a minute because it is this Parliament that the Auditor-General reports to&mdash;not the Government. I guess one could make the distinction between the employer of an auditor in a public corporation&mdash;and that should be, of course, the shareholders&mdash;and the directors, about whose management the auditor reports to the shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to deal with the disgraceful situation in which the Government put the Auditor-General's Office and the Auditor-General himself&mdash;a serious situation of embarrassment over the political stunt involved in forcing the Auditor-General to occupy the head office building of the Australian Labor Party. We have heard all about the disgraceful nature of that stunt, hidden behind a facade of respectability, where the Auditor-General's Office, apparently, had no idea that the ultimate owner of the building was the Labor Party and where a leasing deal was done which appears to be totally out of line with the appropriate levels of the marketplace in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely disgraceful and the direct responsibility of the Government that the Auditor-General has been forced into an embarrassing situation which he clearly does not like. I read from his report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Repeated attempts to get Government agreement to provide purpose-built accommodation in the central triangle, as recommended by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in Report No. 296, have been unsuccessful. Working through appropriate official channels, the Office finally was offered apparently&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I underline the word `apparently'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">suitable accommodation in a privately-financed building. This was overdue.</PARA>
<PARA>He then says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is of deep regret to me that the resulting arrangements&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, getting the Auditor-General under false pretences to occupy the Labor Party's head office building in Canberra&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">through no fault of this Office, have led to concerns being raised and to critical comment in the media and elsewhere. The case for the JCPA recommendation to be implemented was strong and I regret that the Government chose to ignore this recommendation, as with so many others of that report. Acceptance of the JCPA recommendation would have avoided the concerns referred to above.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Auditor-General would not have been put in the embarrassing situation of being the apparent fall guy in a stunt aimed at ensuring an excessive rental to the Labor Party for its head office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other matters in the Auditor-General's annual report that I would like to raise. In the first place, I think the Parliament should note and commend the Auditor-General on the fact that there have been benefits of efficiency audits which, although they are difficult to measure, do show potential savings to the Commonwealth. Eight efficiency audits have been estimated at between $68m and $86m, although the cost of all the efficiency audits undertaken last year was approximately $4.8m. So it is not a bad rate of return or success rate for the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General also goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Audit Office's vision for the future is to be valued as a source of independent and apolitical audit assurance and advice to the Parliament and community on the integrity and performance of all Commonwealth public sector organisations. Excellent professional auditing services and public reports provided by the Audit Office will encourage and assist public sector organisations to achieve higher standards of delivering their services to the Australian community and maximise value for money.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a pity that this Government does not share the Auditor-General's enthusiasm for improving the quality of performance, reducing the cost and maximising value for money. Its continual obstruction of endeavours to improve the capacity of the Audit Office to perform its functions is counterproductive&mdash;except in political terms, because apparently the Government takes the view that, the less the capacity of the Audit Office to supervise, the less the risk of critical comment about the Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few other matters that I think I should mention. The Auditor-General naturally expresses concern about the question of an outside auditor of the National Rail Corporation Ltd. He notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding the Commonwealth Government policy that the Auditor-General be the sole external auditor of all Commonwealth owned or controlled entities, it is understood that a private sector auditor has been appointed as the Corporation's auditor under the Corporations Law. Accordingly, the Corporation is not subject to proper parliamentary scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ultimate responsibility, of course, rests with the Government, but corporatisation should not be used to weaken public accountability, nor to cloud ministerial responsibility for public sector activities.</PARA>
<PARA>I would certainly agree with that. There is a clear need for an effective auditor. There is no doubt that, despite the limitations on the Auditor-General by way of the Government's refusal to provide him with adequate facilities, the Audit Office has demonstrated its effectiveness by qualifying 17 of the 55 audit reports on financial statements of departments. Something like 31 per cent of the reports issued were qualified under section 51(1) of the Audit Act. These qualifications related to failure to keep accounts and records in accordance with section 40 of the Audit Act, financial statements not prepared in accordance with the financial statements guidelines, non-compliance with the provisions of the Constitution and the Audit Act and various other matters pursuant to paragraph 51(1)(d) of the Audit Act. That seems to be a pretty high failure rate&mdash;31 per cent. I hope that departmental officers will endeavour to improve that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General also made the point in passing that within departmental commercial undertakings there were considerable unreported assets and liabilities. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although there have been recent improvements in the level of disclosure by departments, the ANAO has identified a number of significant assets and liabilities that have not been disclosed in departmental financial statements. As a result of a review of a number of issues relating to the adequacy of reporting and disclosure of financial operations in departments, it was found that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a large proportion of Commonwealth assets and liabilities was not accounted for or disclosed in departmental financial statements</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">an aggregated or consolidated report on the financial position of the departments was not available, and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">there were substantial unfunded liabilities that were not clearly reported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, as you will have noted, that report is, in its substance, a major indictment of the Government's approach to reporting, basically, to this Parliament. It matches the indifference and contempt with which this Government, in many instances, approaches the Parliament itself. As the Executive gets stronger and stronger, and particularly as the House of Representatives becomes little more than a voting college for the Executive, this Government becomes more and more arrogant and the need for an Auditor-General to ensure that the arms of the Executive are properly investigated and their functions properly audited, becomes greater and greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General is serving this Parliament far better than many of the senators in this chamber are serving the best interests of this Parliament, particularly those sitting opposite. They should be supporting in their entirety the issues raised by the Auditor-General to ensure that the rights of the Parliament remain paramount in this democracy. I believe that we are approaching a crisis situation where the Auditor-General is forced to go public with the sorts of vigorous concerns that he has expressed in this report today. I commend him for it and I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we saw the pathetic spectacle of the third highest Minister in this Government coming before the Senate confronted by voluminous material which has shown that there is something highly suspicious in the manner in which the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service has been forced to deal with a request from Danpork and its Australian connections&mdash;including Mr Paul Keating, who happens to be Prime Minister of this country&mdash;in relation to the importation of live pigs and genetic material from Denmark.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a pathetic sight because we saw Senator Button, normally a man of integrity and wisdom, foolishly coming before the Senate and saying, `There is absolutely nothing out of the ordinary at all'. Why did he say that? Because he was confronted with what he could not answer yesterday. He was confronted with the fact that two letters were sent by AQIS&mdash;which, I understand, were not some scrappy little faxes, as he described them, but were, in fact, letters&mdash;to the Pork Council of Australia, the prime industry body in this nation. They said that the reason why the importation of live pigs from Denmark had become a high priority issue was that it was raised at prime ministerial level, and subsequently, it had been the subject of Minister to Minister discussions between Australia and Denmark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button came before the Senate chamber and tried to dismiss these things by saying, `They are just scrappy little bits of paper, don't read anything into them'. We are not reading anything into the documents at all; we are just reading what is on the face of the documents. These matters have become a high priority out of nowhere because of various ministerial discussions. Yet Senator Button comes into this chamber day after day, like some wind-up doll, saying that there was absolutely no ministerial discussion at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was obviously absolutely no ministerial thought given to the answer that Senator Button gave to this chamber because the facts are that there has been ministerial interference. How else does he explain telexes such as the one which I tabled in the Senate today. A Department of Primary Industries officer in Brisbane sent an urgent telex to AQIS, Canberra in respect of pigs from Denmark asking, `Could you please tell me. . . Why does this have a priority 1?'. This telex was sent on 5 March 1991, yet the Minister is unable to explain it. He says, `It's just the normal process of government'. All of a sudden something that has been sitting on the backburner for over five years becomes a priority 1 issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, Senator Button is totally incapable of explaining correspondence which says that if the importation of live pigs and genetic material is to become a high priority issue, the priority should not be for Denmark but, instead, should be for live pigs from the United Kingdom, the Irish Republic and the USA. But under this Government, what ought to happen is not what does happen, because under this Government we clearly see that pressure has been placed on AQIS to do something that it did not want to do. One can almost hear the honest, decent members of AQIS squealing, dare I say it, like stuck pigs at the fact that they have been forced to raise to a high priority&mdash;the highest priority of all the work that they do&mdash;the possible importation of live pigs from Denmark. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Boswell quite rightly interjects, they have been told to drop everything and hop onto this. Why has AQIS been told to drop everything and suddenly start looking at live pig imports from Denmark? The answer is contained in a cablegram which I tabled in the Senate today, and I believe that it is important that we read exactly what this cable says. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AQIS has been approached by the Danish Government and the Confederation of Danish Industries to undertake assessment of imports of live pigs and pig semen. Higher priority was, until recently, being placed on these tasks as imports of genetic material were linked to a joint venture proposal between Australia and Danish industry that was being forged during 1991/92.</PARA>
<PARA>Which joint venture proposal might that just happen to be? None other than the joint venture proposal belonging to our estimable Prime Minister, the Hon. Paul J. Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why AQIS was forced to make this a priority 1 issue; not because there was any intrinsic urgency in the matter, but simply because it was the subject of a joint venture proposal between Danish industry and a company associated with the Prime Minister. The paragraph in the cablegram from which I have quoted is also revealing for what it goes on to say. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it now appears that these import proposals may be a lesser priority.</PARA>
<PARA>Why is that a revealing statement? Because this cablegram, sent as it was in July this year, came after Senator Boswell and I first raised the issue of the importation of live pigs from Denmark. It came after Senator Boswell was perspicacious enough to realise that the answers lay in the Government's own papers&mdash;in the Department's own files. Senator Boswell made a freedom of information request and all of a sudden, goodness gracious me, we are going to drop it all. Why? Because the information on the Government's files pointed a finger at those who had sought to improperly interfere with the running of AQIS. The information on the Government's files pointed the finger at the joint venture company belonging to Danish industry and, indirectly, at our estimable Prime Minister, the Hon. Paul J. Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that AQIS reviewed import protocols for Danpork's benefit but not for the benefit of this nation. There is no doubt that in reviewing its import protocols for Danpork's benefit, it did so to the advantage of the Prime Minister. Yet, we have the pathetic spectacle of Senator Button coming into this chamber and saying, `It is a pathetic conspiracy theory; it is a pathetic attempt to paint what is a very serious matter as a conspiracy theory'. But there is no theory; it is only fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why in this outward cablegram is the matter referred to the Department of the Prime Minister? I do not know. Hopefully Senator Button will be able to tell this chamber. Hopefully Senator Button might suddenly realise that this is not an issue which will go away if he keeps saying that there was no ministerial involvement. It is an issue which should be properly answered by the Government. It is an issue which he should answer during Question Time, instead of trying to run away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was twice given the opportunity by me to do so. He was given the opportunity by Senator Boswell to do so. But every single time Senator Button refused to answer the questions. In so doing, he did not do himself a service; he did not do his friend the Prime Minister a service. In thinking that he can stonewall the chamber and by pretending that black is white and white is black, he did a disservice to this chamber. We do not accept that. We do not consider that to be acceptable behaviour on the part of a very senior Minister of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are more and more questions surrounding this matter every single day. The Government just refuses to answer any of the questions that we on this side of the chamber raise. We get to the situation where the Government just wishes that the smell would go away. But the smell will not go away while the Government refuses to sweep out the sties. And that is the rub of the whole thing. The Government just cannot sweep this under the carpet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to Senator Boswell today, Senator Button said, `Well, there was no ministerial contact but if a Minister had been doing his job properly I am sure there would have been some ministerial contact'. The fact that this is a glaring contradiction itself seems to have eluded Senator Button. He said, `Well, you know, we raised the import standards on food coming into this country'. Of course, he did so with our backing. He went on to say, `When we did so, it was as a result of ministerial discussions with AQIS'. Well, congratulations, Senator Button, on stating the obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button was wrong in drawing a parallel between raising the import standards on food coming into this country and lowering the import standards on live pigs and on genetic material coming into this country, bringing with it, as it does, the risk of disease. It is quite simply ludicrous to suggest that lowering the standards to the detriment of the Australian industry can be compared with raising the standards required of food imported to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Button were attempting in that statement to try to vindicate any ministerial involvement in this affair then he is just digging a deeper hole for himself and the Government. Senator Button must answer these questions&mdash;the Government must answer these questions&mdash;because they go right to the heart of the Government. They go right to the heart of the executive process of this nation. And they go right to the heart of the integrity and the trustworthiness not only of this Government but also of the Prime Minister, who is the most senior member of the Executive. They go right to the heart of the highest power in the land. We on this side of the chamber do not believe that the Government can allow the matter to drift on any longer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to join this debate because this matter deserves some answers from the Government. This is not a fishing expedition. This very serious matter, backed up by documentation, has been going on now for some three months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June we asked the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) whether there was any move to bring in live pigs, genetic material, breeding material, semen or embryos. We were told that there were no ministerial or prime ministerial decisions or implications in the matter. Yet, we obtained a letter under the Freedom of Information Act which said that there was ministerial intervention and prime ministerial intervention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between the time that letter was written and the time Senator O'Chee and I raised questions in this place and made an application under freedom of information, on 21 July there was another letter written&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator O'Chee" NAMEID="EU4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That letter refuted the first letter. It is a very serious matter for AQIS to write a letter which says that there was prime ministerial intervention, that there was some movement from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), to request that imports of genetic material and live pigs be allowed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an interview today on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Country Hour</EMPHASIS> Mr Landos said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it was wrong. The original letter was a slip up.</PARA>
<PARA>there are mistakes and there are mistakes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The words in that letter were wrong and it should have made it quite clear that there was no involvement by either the Prime Minister or any Ministers</PARA>
<PARA>So the first letter had a mistake in it; now the second letter has a mistake in it. The second letter did not retract that there was ministerial involvement. The interviewer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But that's a very very serious mistake&mdash;especially when the current Prime Minister has interest in a pig company&mdash;to make such a mistake&mdash;how could it occur?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Landos answered:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes it was one of those slips&mdash;it was a slip that occurred through the drafting of a letter&mdash;look it was bad slip&mdash;I admit that&mdash;and it shouldn't have happened&mdash;but we did our best as soon as we noticed, to correct it on paper and in a very factual way</PARA>
<PARA>It took from 3 June with the first letter to 21 July to correct it. This matter was raised continually in the Senate by Senator O'Chee and I during this time. We asked questions on it over a period of four or five days. Then, six or eight weeks later the letter is refuted and another letter is conveniently put out. That letter says, `Well, look, it is all a terrible mistake'. How can anyone make a mistake like that? How can anyone say that the Prime Minister was not involved when the Prime Minister had an interest in a piggery and when that piggery wanted to bring in genetic material, live pigs or breeding material?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the industry is exerting pressure. The whole industry is saying, `Look, we do not want breeding material coming in from Denmark. There is disease over there. Why do we want it?'. The New South Wales farmers said that they do not want it. Some of the top breeding firms have said they do not want it. The Western Australian pork producers said that they do not want it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some telegrams have been sent by a person&mdash;I do not know his name and I would not mention it if I did&mdash;from the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industries and Energy. In a telex which he sent to his superior he said, `Re animal quarantine import protocols and AQIS, Bulletin such and such 1991, could you please tell me why does this live importation have top priority?'. All of a sudden someone has told him that it has top priority. Who has the capacity in government to make something top priority? Is it the Minister?  I believe that it is one of the Ministers. Really, a Minister is the only person who has the authority to say, `Drop everything&mdash;this is top priority'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we get another memo going around saying that the industry has stated that if AQIS persists with the question of live pig imports, priority should be given to the UK, Eire and North America as the source of animals. No-one in the Australian pig industry, including AQIS, wants to import pigs from Denmark&mdash;either live pigs or genetic or breeding material. All the officers out in the field are saying, `What the devil is going on?', and they are all sending memos saying, `Why does this have top priority?'. After this memo was released Senator O'Chee and I made inquiries in the Senate and then, on 7 July, we had a backdown. This cablegram states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AQIS has also been approached by the Danish Government and the Confederation of Danish Industries to undertake assessment of imports of live pigs and pig semen. Higher priority was, until recently, being placed on these tasks as imports of genetic material were linked to a joint venture proposal between Australia and Danish industry that was being forged during 1991/92.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Do not worry about it, boys, because high priority is off.' Why is it off? Why has the priority been changed? Is it because Senator O'Chee and I have raised these very important issues in the Senate? Is it because we are out there asking these questions? Why was the priority changed after my freedom of information request and our attempt to unravel this in the Senate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are matters of fact. The papers Senator O'Chee and I refer to were tabled in the Senate today and yesterday. It is not good enough for Senator Button to come in here, as he has the capacity to do, and denigrate the issue and the National Party and think that because he has a glib tongue the issue will disappear. It will not disappear because the National Party has tenacity and it is prepared to follow this issue right through. Senator Button can come in here every day and make fun of the issue, but he will not escape it because the issue will be raised until we get answers to these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether Senator Button realises the implications but, if there has been pressure on AQIS to change the protocols in regard to Australia's importation of live pigs and pig semen from a country in which there is disease, this importation could expose Australia's total herd. That is the most serious charge that can ever be levelled at anyone in government because that is the most serious mortal sin that can be committed in this place. </PARA>
