<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">     SUPERANNUATION GUARANTEE      (ADMINISTRATION) BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill was introduced on 2 April 1992. The Government subsequently introduced amendments as a result of consultations with various industry and employer representatives. Those amendments added provisions which permitted contributions to be made in advance, excluded certain foreign executives, and made some minor technical amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since that time the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation has heard evidence on the proposed legislation and has made recommendations in its report released last week. The Government has decided to move amendments to the Bill to give effect to those recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes will be occurring in the context of other changes to superannuation laws, including increased prudential supervision and a gradual increase in the preservation age from 55 to 60, and a change to industrial relations law requiring the Industrial Relations Commission to take superannuation contributions into account in arriving at national wage case decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that the Superannuation Guarantee legislation, in the context of those other changes, represents a major advance in superannuation policy for the working men and women of Australia. It will allow them, when they retire, to benefit from a much higher retirement income. It will allow future governments to increase the aged pension in line with community expectations. It will reduce the future burden on today's youth flowing from our increasing aged-dependence ratio. And it will provide for a much needed increase in private and public savings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minimising Impact on Employers</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of consultations with the Australian Democrats and the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee, the Government has decided to move certain amendments to the Bill with the object of reducing the initial impact on employers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current exempt salary level below which contributions do not have to be made for an employee will be raised from $250 per month to $450. This will also bring the annual exempt level into line with the current income tax exempt threshold of $5,400.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The threshold payroll above which the higher charge percentage applies will be increased from the present $500,000 to $1 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contribution period for which contributions need to be made to avoid the charge for the 1993-94, and subsequent, financial years will be changed from a monthly to a quarterly basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The charge percentage for larger employers will be reduced from 5% to 4% for 1 July 1992 to 31 December 1992. This rate will increase to 5% from 1 January 1993 unless either House of the Parliament defers that rate increase until 1 July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present schedule of charge percentages, reaching 9% by 2000-2001, will be adjusted so that the 9% rate will not be reached until 2002-2003.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Payments to a Complying Fund</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A complying fund is a fund which satisfies the standards set out in the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act and its Regulations. At present, the Bill only treats contributions as counting towards the requisite level if they are made to a complying superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Difficulties arise if an employer contributes to a fund believing it to be a complying fund when it is found subsequently to be a non-complying fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments include provisions to overcome this difficulty by allowing contributions to be counted where the employer had reasonable grounds for believing that the fund was complying. Similar amendments will apply to defined benefit funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Local Councillors</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill presently defines "salary or wages" to include payments to local councillors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment proposed will replace the word "payment" with "remuneration" to make it clear that only payments for work done by councillors will be salary or wages. This amendment will also apply in respect of other Commonwealth, State or Territory employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Technical Amendments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments will also cover three technical aspects of the superannuation guarantee scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, amendments will provide that any superannuation guarantee charge payable by a company in liquidation is to rank equally with employee entitlements. Provisions are also to be included so that a company receiver and manager is required to set aside certain assets in respect of the superannuation guarantee charge of the employer company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current Bill operates by initially imposing the full charge on all employers but reducing it for contributions made to complying funds. There is a technical defect in the formulas used to reduce the percentage, which effectively imposes a charge on some employers who have met the expected minimum contribution. This occurs because the formulas count the full period of employment even if the employee was an exempt employee for some of that time (for example, where an employee is 65 years or older or where the employee's salary is below the exempt level).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment will remove that defect by deeming someone not to be an employee in periods in which they are an exempt employee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, technical amendments will be made in respect of the benefit certificate required so that benefits provided in relation to a defined benefit superannuation scheme can be taken into account when working out an employer's actual level of superannuation support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Full details of the amendments are contained in the Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum being circulated to Honourable Senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I commend the amendments to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are all conscious of the time, and I simply wish to indicate the Opposition's position in relation to these amendments. According to the speech that has just been incorporated, the first batch relates to minimising the impact on employers. Our position is that we are still fundamentally opposed to the whole concept of compulsory superannuation. Nonetheless, we recognise that these are marginal improvements within the context of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill itself and the scheme to which it commits the Government. However, even with these amendments, the Government is really only tinkering at the edges and, therefore, we oppose each amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal involving payments to a complying fund seems to make sense. Again, within the context of the Bill, it is reasonable to say that employers should not be penalised if they act in good faith and then subsequently discover that they have made a payment to a non-complying fund. Therefore, that proposal, which I am sure will be supported by the Australian Democrats, is one that significantly improves the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same can be said in relation to local government councillors. Our fundamental objection is that a whole series of people are being unnecessarily swept up in this legislation to the extent that we will have many more inaccurate accounts than ever before. To the extent that this amendment at least makes it clear that only payments for work done by councillors will be salaries or wages, it is an improvement and is in line with the representations that have been made to us. We therefore welcome that amendment. The same can be said in respect of the technical amendments which are indicated. </PARA>

I wonder whether the Government is aware that one of the complications this might cause is that some people who are now in a personal superannuation fund and who may lose a certain amount of their tax deductibility, may be worse off under this proposal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;People will not be worse off directly as a result of this proposal because it goes directly to merely the payment. There are subsequent decisions to be made about tax arrangements that cover people who are making contributions. I am not trying to avoid the fact that, if you look at all the changes that will take place, it is nevertheless possible that somebody will gain under the levy and, depending on the announcements of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) about the taxation of contributions, it is conceivable that they will lose some tax deductibility benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following on from that, one of the things that seemed to be confusing people in the community was the determination of either an award or a levy. We are told by the superannuation hot line that an award overrules the levy, but the levy does not overrule the award. This could mean that in view of the Democrats' agreement that the levy will not come in until people are earning $450 a month, we still have the situation where, for instance, employers in the hospitality industry will have to pay superannuation for casual employees earning only $250 a month. Why is the Government retaining the productivity award system of superannuation now that it is introducing a compulsory levy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Amendment No. 7 gives expression to concerns that have been made to us&mdash;particularly by Esso, but I am sure there are others in the same situation. As I understand it, the Government is exempting managerial staff who have more than adequate superannuation arrangements being provided by their overseas employers but who come to Australia on a short term contract basis. In those circumstances it would seem unnecessary, and is in fact simply sheer duplication, to require that they comply.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In outlining the Government's opposition to these two amendments, I will pick up the point of Senator Kernot's question, if I understand it correctly. Our concern is similar to the concern which underlies some of the queries that were raised, for example, by the shearers and their representatives. Let us not get into the argument about whether the shearers and their representatives are right. They have raised the concern that arrangements exist which make it cheaper for Australian employers to employ people from a country other than Australia because they do not have to comply with the requirements of Australian awards or laws because, in that instance, they can establish an artificial contract relationship in New Zealand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our concern with the principle of amendment No. 7 is that in the tourist industry, for example, which might apply in this case, if there is a contest for employment between an Australian employee and an employee resident overseas, it may be that we are building an incentive for the employment of that person from overseas. One can make that too melodramatic because there is a point underlying it that says, `Obviously we are not contributing to the retirement income of that person, so there ought not be a levy'. On balance, at this stage, I think the Government's view is that we should not go in this direction because of the labour market distortions that will arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our more serious concern, in terms of the administrability of the scheme as a whole, relates to amendment No. 1. The two amendments hang together: one is the corollary of the other because one needs the proposed amendment to the definition of `exempt employee' before one can make sense of proposed subclause (e) in amendment No. 7. Firstly, it requires the employers to have knowledge, which it may not be possible for them to have, about the resident status of employees. That information is not always available. More importantly, it requires the Commissioner of Taxation to know what superannuation&mdash;or, as has been described here, `benefits in the nature of superannuation', which is open to interpretation as to whether that is an accurate description of what is being applied in a particular country&mdash;is provided in another country and whether it is provided in the circumstances of this individual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commissioner needs to know where the person is ordinarily resident. We can all think of circumstances, sometimes very unfortunate circumstances, concerning individuals who are resident in Australia, but ordinarily resident no-one could be quite sure where, because of refugee situations or whatever. The Commissioner would need to be able to determine the level of the overseas benefit in such a comparable way that he could make an interpretation that it is not inferior, as required by proposed subclause (ii). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts that are required to make this amendment work, in at least some instances, will not be available either to the employer or the Commissioner. Therefore, the judgments that are required will not able to be made properly. We have the problem of labour market distortion with regard to amendment No. 7. Therefore, we are opposed to both of them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, I put on the record that what the Government is saying&mdash;and I think it is implicit in Senator Kernot's question also&mdash;is that comparative wage arrangements are more important than retirement income arrangements. This amendment is clearly designed to apply only where people already have superannuation being paid for them. In other words, there is no need to have superannuation paid in this country in that circumstance, without unnecessary duplication.  The Government is saying, `We really don't care about that. This is all about ensuring that people don't get some sort of comparative advantage out of the total remuneration package that might need to be paid'. I can understand those considerations, but I simply want to make it clear that this is yet another example of industrial relations considerations overriding genuine retirement incomes policy.</PARA></TALK.START>

There is sufficient time to pay because of the deferral arrangements in the first year. We think most people will be able to comply, but it may be that an employer would be uncertain as to whether the payments would be to a fund that met the requirements and may not therefore discharge its obligations under the legislation. Employers would be wise, because we have given them the leeway about the initial payments, to use that time to confirm the status of the fund. I do not regard that as likely to be a common problem or as likely to undermine the whole structure of the scheme.

The arrangements will cover whether a person can leave work at 55 and get benefits and whether they can take any of their lump sum for mortgages et cetera. These issues have been in debate at the very least since the Wollongong conference that some of us attended concerning superannuation, and they have been debated to some extent by, for example, the ACTU, for longer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate that the amendments in relation to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act are consequential. Requiring the information to be provided to the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner in order to provide a list of funds which will be able to accept superannuation guarantee moneys is a logical consequence of the Superannuation Guarantee Levy Bill. We therefore do not have any major objection, except our fundamental one in principle to the whole regime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change to the Income Tax Assessment Act, again requiring a receiver and manager to set aside certain company assets to cover the superannuation guarantee charge of an employer company, is an extension of the principle of funding and is certainly consistent with the approach of the Bill. I would like to pose a question to Senator McMullan in relation to the proposed amendment to the Industrial Relations Act. In the accompanying speech, Senator McMullan says&mdash;and indeed I think this was the form of words agreed upon by the Australian Democrats&mdash;that the superannuation contributions would be taken into account by the IRC. The amendment proposed is that the Commission must have regard to the operation of the  Act&mdash;and  I</PARA>
<PARA>presume that refers to the 1992 Act rather than the 1922 one. Could Senator McMullan indicate whether there is, in fact, any distinction between `taking into account' and `having regard to'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will certainly be watching with a great deal of interest to see the extent to which the Industrial Relations Commission genuinely discounts wage claims to take account of the SGC regime. I have to say, however, that its track record and its constitutional obligation to accord primacy to industrial relations considerations and the conciliation and arbitration of industrial disputes ahead of sensible wage outcomes, productivity increases and general affordability principles are well known. Therefore, we are somewhat sceptical about the prospects of a genuine discount being put into place, other than the sorts of discounts that have accompanied national wage cases in recent years whereby pious promises are made about future work practices being negotiated away and those future promises forming the current basis for wage increases. Could Senator McMullan indicate whether what he has in mind for the Commission simply takes into account or has regard to discounting up front; in other words, taking account of performance to date rather than merely future promises?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will be a matter entirely for the Industrial Relations Commission to decide on the appropriate weight to be given to the level of contributions contemplated under the superannuation guarantee legislation when dealing with national wage case applications. The Government felt that under the Industrial Relations Commission's existing powers and responsibilities what this amendment does could in any event have been achieved, and in our view would have been achieved. We are trying to make it an explicit requirement simply to make it more apparent. We believe that it would have been inevitable and desirable that the Industrial Relations Commission would have taken these factors into account and it would have been reflected in any Government submission to that case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not regard the change of wording as of any significance; it is intended to be the same. As Senator Alston knows, the Industrial Relations Act is not my area. As I understand it, the drafting has to be consistent with other factors.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One thing that influenced me in my decision to push for this explicitness was simply that, on the one hand, we were compelling employers to a certain course of action, while the other party in the equation was asking us to take in good faith based on past practice a promise that it would continue to hold down wage claims according to the inflation levels of major trading partners.

In the meantime, I believe that we have a reasonable outcome, which is an explicit direction to the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to this question because it gives me a great deal of concern, and I am sure that I am speaking for a number of people on one side of the chamber who perhaps cannot express this view. I cannot possibly go along with this proposition because it has grave implications now and into the unforeseen future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this legislation the Government is virtually instructing the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to take account of what has occurred as a result of these measures. In plain terms, that means that it will discount increases that the workers are entitled to in national wage cases as a result of increases in the cost of living. There is no way that I would go along with that proposition. That is what the result will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worker is not getting the money now in his or her pocket. The worker already has had his or her wage rate substantially slashed. For example, since 1984 the tradesman's rate has declined by 14.6 per cent. That is now due to decline even further. That is one reason why families cannot live on one income. For example, an ASO4 in the Australian Public Service has also had his or her salary decline in real terms by about that amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is offsetting a particular percentage, but what about when it comes to the figure of 9 per cent? The Government is building into the Industrial Relations Act a provision which virtually tells the Commission to discount increases that the worker desires and needs as a result of increased costs of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point is that the wage of a worker who is 30 years of age, for example, and who is living on one income and struggling to make ends meet for his wife and family, will be cut. The wage in his pocket will be cut as a result of this legislation and for what? So far as he is concerned it is for something that will occur in 30 years time. What government will be in power here in 30 years time? When an older worker who is now 50 years of age retires and becomes eligible for a part pension, who is to say that the government at that time will not discount the pension to be paid to the person who is entitled to superannuation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have grave problems with this particular provision. I feel that the Parliamentary Secretary should answer on behalf of the Government the questions I have raised on behalf of the Government. I want to hear what he has to say about the views the Government will take in respect of this before the Industrial Relations Commission. It is important to know that before we vote. It is probably important on that side of the House, it is equally important from my point of view and, presumably, from the point of view of the Senator McMullan's colleagues. The Government must have thought about this and I would like Senator McMullan to respond and let us know what its views are. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure whether there is much synergy between the two, but they each have their separate buzzers. The Broadcasting Services Bill 1992 and the Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1992 represent the first major attempt to rewrite broadcasting legislation in 50 years. They have had one of the longest gestation periods in history. I can recall a solemn promise being made by the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, prior to the 1987 election to urgently overhaul this archaic legislation, as I think he described it, and Mr Willis during the next three years frantically scratching around to try to ensure that we finally had a broadcasting Bill that brought us up to date and would take us into the twenty-first century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Broadcasting Bill, which is the major Bill in the package, certainly is a very great step forward and will in many respects ensure that the Parliament and the institutions that are established under the Bill are at last able to recognise the rapid change in transmission technologies, the convergence of broadcasting in telecommunications and the globalisation of communications industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current regulatory structures and mechanisms are based on restricted entry to scarce resources and are no longer appropriate. Indeed, in many respects they belong to an earlier era when communications issues were seen as essentially technical problems to be adjusted in a relatively static environment. The Broadcasting Bill recognises that the law has simply not been able to keep up with the pace of technological change and should certainly not be trying to pick winners and quarantine technologies. The new approach is much more deregulatory and technology neutral. We very much support the overall thrust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some respects, however, the Bill does not seem to be willing to recognise the pivotal role that ought to be played by the Trade Practices Commission as a competitive watchdog in promoting and facilitating the introduction of new technologies and services; and in ensuring that there is, indeed, a diversity of services and programs to a much greater extent than had previously been the case and which is now, I think for the first time, much more possible as a result of many of the remarkable changes that are currently taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill establishes an Australian Broadcasting Authority with less intrusive requirements than the existing tribunal. It encourages diversity and competition, and allows the introduction of more broadcasting services. Decisions have yet to be made on licence fees for commercial broadcasting services and on the detail for the price based competitive licence allocation processes. Reduced reporting requirements will result in lower costs to the broadcasting industry; improved efficiency should result from greater competition; and greater economic activity in the supply of equipment and programs should be generated by facilitating the introduction of new technologies and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill is therefore a significant step forward, but in some respects it does not go as far as we would like. I think it is appropriate that I take the opportunity today to spell out the preferred course we believe that broadcasting should take&mdash;and I use the word `broadcasting' in the broadest sense. One probably could not find a better example of the difficulties that legislators have in keeping up with the pace of technological change than a broadcasting Bill which is now regulating `narrowcasting'. In logical terms, that is a contradiction, but nonetheless it is a reflection that there are now so many different gradations of service and degrees of difficulty of access that one simply cannot mandate technologies, one cannot require people to stay within boxes any more, and one therefore ought to have a regime that will facilitate change in an effective manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to some of the proposals that we intend to put forward and the amendments that we intend to move in due course. We require greater parliamentary scrutiny of planning measures and procedures by making a number of changes proceed by way of disallowable instruments. In the area of commercial radio and television, there is the obnoxious and indefensible ban on political advertising, which I think even the Government is having second thoughts about, no doubt for purely pragmatic reasons. Maybe the second thoughts have not found their way into a commitment to legislative change, but certainly there have been a number of reports about Mr Keating, at least for pragmatic reasons, accepting that it does not make a great deal of sense. One would have hoped that the debate would proceed on a higher moral plane than that, because it is clearly one of the grossest infringements of freedom of speech. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Collins" NAMEID="OF4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we could all have taken the high moral ground without fear of people casting stones if we had accepted the status quo. But once the Government moved unilaterally to do what it has done it left itself open to that charge. We certainly maintain a fundamental objection to the ban on political advertising and we will move an amendment accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to commercial radio, we favour the removal of cross-media rules between radio, television and newspapers. In reflection of the fact that radio is now a mature industry, that there are very many more players, that because of digital compression and the extent to which technology has now largely overcome separation problems and, indeed, the quality of broadcasts as a result of the inevitable moves from analog to digital, we will not have the same problems that we had in the past of a very limited amount of spectrum being allocated to a few major players. That greater degree of diversity and maturity should ensure that no-one will be able to capture the market, and we should therefore have a commitment to allowing in a much greater number of players. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also want to ensure that applicants for supplementary FM licences already in the system are able to operate under the rules of the current Broadcasting Act. To the extent that there are broadcasters who have applications currently in process, we certainly do not want to see them disadvantaged or not eligible to convert to FM licences. Therefore, we will favour the fast tracking of FM services, particularly in remote and regional areas where there are currently no such services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also conduct an early review of arrangements, but we would retain the two to a market rule at the present time. We would also maintain the requirement under the current Broadcasting Act in regard to religious broadcasts, and we would retain the intent of the prohibition on the broadcasting of blasphemous material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as commercial television is concerned, we have already made it clear that we do not accept the 1997 moratorium on change and we will undertake an immediate review of the limits to entry to the commercial television market. That is not to say that we favour in any way open slather as such; it is simply a recognition of the fact that it is inappropriate to lock oneself into a mould for a five-year period when there are such dramatic changes taking place. The introduction of pay television, which is long overdue, will obviously have a significant impact on the free to air broadcasters, and we want those matters to be taken into account as well. Proposals such as an open university channel, which could well be the appropriate forum for education services to be delivered on the sixth UHF frequency, may well be another way in which an early review of the current arrangements would result in greater diversity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would also extend the audience reach limit to 100 per cent. There has been a lot of toing-and-froing on this over the years. No-one has ever really been able to provide a sensible rationale as to why the figure was, I think, at one stage 43 per cent; then a bit of horse trading with our coalition partners took it to 60 per cent; now the Government wants to go to 75 per cent. All of these figures are essentially arbitrary. The principle ought to be that we should not try to put restraints on technology. Indeed, there will be many opportunities for people to derive economies of scale from being able to access the entire Australian market and, therefore, we favour the 100 per cent limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sorts of flip-flops that have gone on in a range of areas as far as this Government is concerned are extraordinary. They have been motivated entirely by politically pragmatic considerations. There is no rhyme or reason for, in one instance, as I recall it, allowing  something like 49 per cent foreign ownership, effectively, through a series of direct and indirect interests, and then suddenly bringing that down. Again, there were all sorts of different formulas that were floated by Caucus and others. Finally, we came up with a 20 per cent limit. Now other changes are proposed; whether they be to a 30 per cent or a 40 per cent limit&mdash;none of it really matters in the long run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is crucially important is that we ought to have access to the best that overseas technology can offer, the accumulated wisdom and experience that will increasingly become essential in a global market. If we are serious about wanting to ensure that we do end up with quality broadcasting in this country, we certainly should not hide behind artificial barriers that will basically result in backwater arrangements. We currently have two free to air broadcasters that are limping on from day to day in financial terms, one owned by Westpac Bank. The end result of that is that they are very much constrained in terms of capital investment, acquisition of new technology, buying of up-to-date programming and the like. We therefore think that foreign ownership is not the bogey that the Democrats would have it painted as being. We will reassess the whole approach on a case by case basis. New Zealand interests will be treated in the same way as Australian interests and local content regulations would be removed as they apply to New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We indicate support of self-regulation of advertising. We are conscious of the difficulties that have arisen in recent years as a result of self-regulation, but we do not favour time standards. We accept that FACTS will indeed review and upgrade the standards of the industry. We proceed very much on the basis that there will be good faith in recognising and being responsive to community concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certainly acutely conscious of a number of representations made to me about people who complain that all the best movie programs are decimated by back-end loading; in other words, you are sucked in to watch the first hour of a movie as it is essentially ad-free, and then the last climactic half hour or one hour is torn to shreds by the screening of ads every three or four minutes. I have had that experience very occasionally, and I am sure that regular viewers will be regularly annoyed by that sort of system. I am sure that the commercial stations realise that they are on notice that, in a sense, they simply cannot get away with flouting the wishes of the viewers. We hope that they will be much more responsive to those concerns than they would appear to have been to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As far as standards are concerned, we would require that a children's television standard be established jointly by the ABA and the Australian Children's Television Foundation. We would make it mandatory rather than optional that matters must be taken into account in the development of codes of practice. We would require in relation to program promotions that the standard released by FACTS on 18 June last be applicable to the ABA, given that it is more restrictive than the current ABT standard. We would retain the intent of the draft exposure, that prevailing community standards to matters of taste and decency must be taken into account in the development of those codes of practice. We would require that, if no code of practice has been registered with the ABA, the ABA `must' rather than `may' determine a standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would remove the R category for pay television and apply the standards for commercial television, pending the completion of a comprehensive public inquiry into content. I understand from discussions with the industry that that is not seen as any impediment in commercial terms to bidding for the licences. There are a number of other fundamental reasons why they might be very reluctant to come to the barrier, but certainly that is not a reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is only proper, given the level of community concern about violence and soft-core pornography, that we should not simply rush into the issue and that we should have it properly assessed. The holding position that I foreshadow today is very much in line with the recommendation of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Telecommunications Technologies, which tabled its report yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would also favour a code for commercial television governing children's television in violence as being appropriate for pay television. We would require, under the ABC Act, that the codes of practice relating to programming matters developed must also be published in the ABC's annual report. We, of course, indicate support for the continued banning of X-rated material for all categories of service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pay television by satellite is probably the most contentious aspect of the principal Bill. We indicate our support for pay television as a matter of principle. This has been on the front-burner and alternatively the back-burner for at least 12 years. It has been a matter of regret to us that it has taken so long to get to the starting point, but hopefully we are almost there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only problem is that when we have fundamental shifts of policy of the sort we saw a few weeks ago with Mr Keating's triple back flip with pike, where even the Minister had no idea what was being proposed until he walked into the room and was told, it is inevitable that what might get one a cheap headline on day one will, when exposed to the light of day by the industry, be greeted fairly sceptically&mdash;and I think that is what has happened to date. What we have seen is that a number of the major potential applicants have expressed great scepticism about the affordability of the very limited 12-month exclusivity period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, as has been put to me, who would want to put up front something of the order of half a billion dollars, run the very real prospect of the whole deal falling over or being swamped within a very limited time frame and then walk away with a smile? The Minister may know more than we do, but all the indications to date are that there will be a very great deal of reluctance to put in genuine bids under the current regime. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A more competitive structure for the remaining five transponders would involve five separate licences being issued so that each applicant would be confined to one licence only or one transponder only.

Information to be gathered by the ABA would require the insertion of additional subclauses to provide that a journalist is not required to answer a question or produce a document which would disclose the source of information and that such non-disclosure does not constitute a contempt. That is a matter that has been canvassed publicly in recent days by people such as the President of the ACTU. We acknowledge that it is certainly not desirable to put journalists in a position where they are not able to effectively pursue investigative journalism for fear of being required to disclose their sources. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Okay. Hopefully, we will have a chance to look at that and others. As far as the ABA is concerned, no term of office appears to be provided in the legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is a welcome step forward. It is an acknowledgment that telecommunications broadcasting and computing are undergoing rapid change and convergence and that the new technologies which are emerging do not necessarily respect national borders. Many of those technologies have the potential to remove scarcity of the spectrum for radio&mdash;in particular with digital audio broadcasting and the fibre optic revolution, which is upon us. All have the ability to deliver hundreds of channels into the home and office. As markets converge, there will be, I hope, a much more market driven approach to the whole area and it will be much more a matter of broad brush regulation and detailed attempts to restrain the rate of change and to somehow second guess what is in the best interests of consumers and others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our paramount concern ought to be for the listeners and the viewers. We certainly believe that in a deregulatory regime the players themselves will need to be responsive to those changes, not just in an aesthetic sense but in a market sense because in many respects, particularly in the area of pay television, you simply go broke if you do not deliver the goods. We wish to see a regime that allows for a regulator to take a broad view rather than being required to spend endless hours and indeed others being required to spend endless thousands of dollars on quite often meaningless licence renewal hearings and other pro forma applications. That is something that ought to be put very much behind us. We do not want people using their pockets to freeze others out of the game. We want them to use their resources for the benefit of consumers. They will best do that by investing in technologies and programming rather than fighting to maintain their patches through litigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hopefully, when we have all had an opportunity to digest the amendments that have only recently been circulated on all sides, and when we finalise the process, we will have in place a much better version of broadcasting regulation&mdash;one that will carry us through to the twenty-first century. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Alston has said, and as the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins, in introducing the Bill a couple of weeks ago, pointed out, this is a major rewrite&mdash;the major rewrite&mdash;of broadcasting legislation, bringing the Broadcasting Act of 1942 up to date. As is the case with many Acts of Parliament, the Broadcasting Act has been considerably and regularly amended since its original passage. The Broadcasting Act, in particular, has been subject to amendment brought about by necessity due to changes in technology, the development of broadcasting and, as Senator Alston has pointed out, the development of narrowcasting and other forms of technology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Discussions, at least in some form or another, about this rewrite go back&mdash;certainly to my knowledge&mdash;to Senator Gareth Evans's time as Minister for Transport and Communications. At that time I had shadow responsibility for this portfolio on behalf of the Democrats. I now have that responsibility again. So it has been with some interest that I have watched and been part of the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general terms, the process by which we have been debating the Broadcasting Services Bill today has been a very good one. In late November and early December last year we had a draft Bill with which I was not particularly happy. I thought it took the changed approach to regulation too far down the deregulatory track. It was too much of a hands-off process. It was one which did not really allow sufficiently for community input. The Democrats and others in the community believed the public interest issues were not appropriately or adequately dealt with. It was, however, a genuine draft and I want to commend the various Ministers, their advisers and the departmental people responsible for their part in the process of consultation that took place between then and the introduction of the Bill here a couple of weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that all of us had a good idea of what the eventual Bill was going to look like, with the exception of part 7, that being the pay TV section. I want to make the point here at the beginning of the debate that I think it has been a good process. I think that the outcome has been as good as we could have expected in a political environment where deregulation is the go and has been for some years. I think that most groups in the community who are concerned about the delivery of broadcast services to the consuming community, about specific industry areas, about Australian content production in other manufacturing sectors and about the whole question of the ability of this area of regulation to work effectively, believe that we have something which builds on the early ABT experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of us would deny that in our attempts to regulate through that process we have, in fact, created barriers, hurdles and processes which have not always worked very well, even though they may have had the best of intent.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From time to time, we found that the old Australian Broadcasting Tribunal did not have sufficient teeth and it might have been argued that, in giving it teeth, we actually impeded its processes. However, that was part of the learning curve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will now have an Australian broadcasting authority with a more streamlined procedure but, from our viewpoint, one which is accountable and which takes into account the public interest. At this point I should say that I propose an amendment which reinstates somewhat further, in my view, the emphasis on public interest in the objects of the Bill. In spite of the positive comments I have made, I think that a change in wording is necessary and I will be proposing such an amendment to the objects of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I know there are a lot of industry people interested in this debate, I want to make it clear that my amendment talks about protection of the public interest, but takes into account the costs to the industry of regulation. I am not ignoring that question in moving this amendment; I simply think there is a need in the objects of the Bill to lay that emphasis which, when implemented, will carry through to all of the other provisions of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, in terms of the public processes, I will be moving another amendment to another section of the Bill relating to applications for licence renewals under the Australian Broadcasting Authority. Under this Bill, notification to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Government</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> is all that is required. The Australian Democrats believe that notification to a newspaper circulating in the area where the licence will apply should also be legislated, and I will be moving an amendment to that effect. We believe the public interest is served by maximising public information in this kind of area. It is something that has been a part of previous processes and we want to see that included in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to leave all of my comments about part 7 and the pay TV aspect until I have covered other areas in the legislation which I propose to amend. I will also be moving an amendment to ensure that programming standards will apply to all subscriber services, not just to satellite broadcasts. I found that to be a deficiency in the original legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have heard from the Opposition is quite extraordinary, mostly with regard to pay TV but in a number of other areas as well. The Opposition puts forward its policy in this area as one which is hands off, deregulatory, all on the arguments of introduction of masses of competition, all in the interests of consumers and industry. It is the fairy story of the day. Yet there are selective areas where the Opposition is quite clearly prepared to regulate. Again, I will refer to most of those in my discussions on pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the position the Democrats take is much more honest; that is, we believe in selective regulation. This goes across policy areas, and is no less the case in broadcasting. We are prepared to say that there are certain areas which we consider to be very important and we are prepared to regulate in those areas for whatever reason. This broadcasting legislation is no different. It is along that track that I am proposing an amendment to have advertising time standards enforced by the ABA in the same way as children's programming and Australian content are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am doing this for a particular set of reasons. We have seen self-regulation given in this area and it has not worked. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal stepped in and imposed a set of standards. Those standards are before the courts at this moment. I understand that that court decision will be brought down this afternoon. It is possible that that court decision could wipe out the standards that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has in place. If it does, I doubt whether the provisions of this Bill will be any help to us at all. I understand that the Government's intention was to have the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's advertising time standards carry over until such time as the Australian Broadcasting Authority, established by this Bill, was able to approve, under the processes in this Bill, the whole range of voluntary codes. If there is not anything to hand over as a result of today's court decision, that would be a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have an amendment to tighten up the grandfathering provisions in the Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill, because I felt that that was necessary anyway. I hope that, if the Government does not accept my initial amendment, it will accept that one, should we have any standards left to carry over&mdash;depending on what happens in the courts in Sydney where those standards are being challenged by two of the commercial broadcasters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the immediate practicality. In general terms, leaving aside the court case, I believe that advertising time standards have been seen to have failed under self-regulation. Since that is a very significant area of the activities of commercial broadcasters, I think there are very strong arguments that they, too, should be direct responsibilities of the Australian Broadcasting Authority that we are establishing with this Bill. I will be moving an amendment to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will also be moving an amendment, with respect to the development of standards, which asks that we also require the Australian Broadcasting Authority to consider the portrayal of women and their roles in society as part of the list of issues that are to be taken into account in the establishment of standards which then become a part of licence provisions. This issue has been raised previously. In fact, the Minister assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women (Ms Fatin) has had a committee look at this question. I believe it is a matter of sufficient concern in the community, particularly to women and to me. I want to see this, along with the other broad issues that are in the legislation, as part of this process which is being developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps an issue of great emphasis for the Australian Democrats in this legislation, as in many other areas of legislation, is the role and fate of our national broadcasters. The Australian Democrats believe that the ABC and the SBS should not be brought under the jurisdiction of the Australian Broadcasting Authority in any way. Under their respective Acts, we believe that both national broadcasters have appropriate legislative procedures in many areas, including the area of complaints. We do not believe that the ABA's involvement is necessary. Indeed, we believe that it makes something of a mockery of the independent statutory nature of the separate Acts of Parliament of our public broadcasters. We want to emphasise that issue. We take that as one of our major issues of concern in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major issue relates to the ABA's powers of   investigation. Much has been said about this question to most of us who have been taking an interest in this legislation. One might say that something of a campaign is being waged on this by people in the media&mdash;people who have a great deal of influence and opportunity to run such campaigns. I do not think we should see that campaign as a matter of self-interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I share the concerns expressed by professionals and professional organisations about the possible effect of the very sweeping powers of investigation in this legislation on the ability of journalists in particular, and people putting together broadcast programs generally, to put together programs without fear or favour. The ultimate concern is about what sanctions this brings down upon the heads of those people involved in that programming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a series of amendments which do not detract from the ABA's ability to investigate a wide range of matters, particularly in relation to its licensing responsibilities, which would remove its ability to do this when it comes to program content. I believe that is how we can ensure that, in particular, investigative journalism in this country&mdash;and there is some debate about the standard of investigative journalism in this country, but there have been plenty of examples over the years where it has been vital to our democratic processes&mdash;is not interrupted or interfered with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, I do not want to be seen to be wanting to place journalists and broadcast programmers above the law in any particular way. It is a difficult matter that concerns us all around this chamber. I do hope that, in the process on further debate in this legislation, we will come to the right approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have put up a series of amendments which I think will have this effect; no doubt others will have something to say on those amendments. Basically, the amendments take program content out of the purview of the ABA's powers of investigation. I do not believe that that in any way damages the opportunity of the ABA to take up its responsibilities with regard to, for example, children's programming. My amendments would not prohibit any voluntary turning over of program material to the ABA for investigation, which anyone would have to do if, for instance, children's programming were classified. That is a positive and voluntary move. I believe that what I am proposing only prohibits the ABA investigating program material on its initiative as part of the other investigation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have covered the issues of major concern to the Democrats on which I will be moving amendments. The Democrats have strong views about foreign ownership levels. We would not have wanted to see them go as high as 35 per cent in the pay television area. However, I note that the Opposition says that it opposes that measure. Therefore, keeping it at 35 per cent depends on the Democrats. I want to make it quite clear that it will not go any higher&mdash;at least not while we are around and while the Government sticks to that level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have expressed my views about how long pay television will last. I quiver in my shoes at the thought of a weak Federal government coming in here and trying to lift the level of foreign ownership. We would certainly oppose any lift in that regard. I appreciate that people in Caucus have probably been responsible for keeping it as low as 35 per cent in the first place, knowing that they would have our support in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pay television is perhaps the most significant area. It is the exception to what I said at the outset where we had good, deep and quite lengthy consultation on the rest of the Bill in a wide section of the community with all those people who were interested. We have had a succession of Ministers in this portfolio in the past few months and that has been one of the reasons why the ticklish questions concerning pay TV have not been resolved until the last minute. It has been very much a last minute process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the decision having been made, I have made it quite clear on behalf of the Democrats from the beginning that we believe the package put forward by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and picked up in this legislation is fatally flawed. Our views on that have been endorsed by independent technical experts, academics and a wide cross-section of industry interests who have been waiting first for over 10 years for a decision to be made that pay TV could go ahead and then a series of months for a decision to be made on the basis on which it would go ahead. I quote from a document sent to me by Stewart Fist, who is termed here a `technical writer'. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No-one doubts that the primary decision to give pay TV to AUSSAT was a pay-off. It was Beazley's bribe to Optus for agreeing to take the embarrassment of AUSSAT off the Government's hands at a fictitious multi-million dollar figure.</PARA>
<PARA>I could not have said it better myself, and perhaps I have said it equally as well. To the Democrats, the whole question of pay TV is a Mount Everest issue: it is there so we have to climb it. We have never agreed that we should have pay TV. However, once it was brought to us, courtesy of the often existing unholy alliance between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party, we took it upon ourselves to take the most responsible attitude we could. We looked at a couple of benchmarks and one of those was the consumers of television services in this country. Even after five years, if pay TV does get off the ground, the majority of consumers will still use free to air services. That is a given fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quiver again in my shoes listening to Senator Alston and considering the things the Opposition's package intends to do to those free to air broadcasters by allowing advertising on pay TV at a time when, as he said himself, two of our commercial broadcasters are hard up against the wall anyway. The advertising industry has plateaued; it is patchy. There is no slack in there and there has not been for most of the last decade. The Opposition talks about an immediate review of the existing situation applying to commercial broadcasters with the potential of the almost immediate introduction of further competition, again at a time when they really cannot afford it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not here to stand up in favour of commercial television operators. That is not what I am doing. I am saying that Australian television consumers must have free access, as they always have. There is no way one can argue that the introduction of pay TV is a plus. There must not be a transfer across of viewing opportunities to a system which only the select few will have. I will not have one and the Minister said at one point he will not have one. Why would we pay money to put stuff into a house that we do not live in? I do not think we parliamentarians are a very good market, but our kids might get a paper round and get one for themselves. That is their business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have tried to take a responsible attitude. Pay TV was sold to Caucus on the basis that it would involve the development of Australian industry&mdash;the manufacturing and production industries&mdash;so that there would be jobs in it and that this would be a development for us in Australia. That will not happen if we believe that our market is enough to support a whole new manufacturing industry and development in Australian production. We must realise that we are a piddly little market down here in the South Pacific. The only reason why manufacturers are interested in building up manufacturing in this area in this country is if it provides a platform into the wider market in Asia. They will not be interested. They have told us all. We have all had the documentation and I will not have time to read it all out. It is all on the record and most of it has been on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are not going to have that if they have to limp into a process where they have no protection and no guarantee that in this piddly little market, with full and open competition, under Senator Alston's process, with six jumping in all at once and one of them with a major advantage&mdash;Kerry Packer, who is supposedly locked out by the Government's system which, of course, I will have something to say about in a minute&mdash;there will be a level playing field and incentive for industry development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we will get cheap rubbish from Asia, as far as hardware is concerned, and we will have lost a major industry opportunity. Mind you, I contend that we will have already done that if we end up with the Government's package, which it looks as though we will. A one-year period of exclusivity is not enough&mdash;all the industry people are telling us that&mdash;for the sort of process that manufacturers need to get this platform into Asia established in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It comes back to what I have said&mdash;the Democrats believe in selective regulation. Our whole policy on tariffs at the moment, which is being articulated often, demonstrates that. Our policy in all areas demonstrates that and we do not resile from it at all. We believe it is essential to understand what the realities are, where the bumps are in the level playing field, what the market really means and what the market can really deliver. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that this slightly less flat-earth proposal of the Government's is fatally flawed by virtue of the fact that there is only that one-year period of exclusivity. Through some of the process available under the legislation as it stands, depending on what the Government decides to do with the allocation of its second and third licences for the fifth and sixth transponders, it may be possible that that period of time will be slightly longer. There may be ways in which the Government is prepared to stand behind its commitment to the development of a manufacturing industry around pay TV. I hope we will hear from the Minister on those questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reading between the lines, Senator Alston seemed to have heard some of the concerns about viability that the industry put to him, yet the solution for six licences all at once, one on each transponder, puts forward a more fragmented and more economically non-viable market. It seemed to me the greatest leap of logic I have heard in this place since I last had this portfolio, and the Opposition was faced with the Government trying to push the level of audience reached from 60 per cent up to 75 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston was not the shadow spokesperson at that time. The Opposition had a bit of trouble with a policy vacuum. Members of the Opposition had a meeting late one night and came up with a policy which said, `We want 100 per cent audience reached'. So they came into this chamber and opposed the Government's lifting to 75 per cent because it was not 100 per cent. This is the kind of logic behind Senator Alston's position. He stood there and said, `The operators and the potential bidders are all saying that a year is not long enough so we will let them all in, all at once, on six transponders and Bob's your uncle'. That is the greatest leap of logic since `75 per cent is not 100 per cent' and, therefore, those opposite opposed it even though it was up from 60 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that really concerns me about the Opposition's proposal for these six immediate licences is this pig in a poke bundling. The mind boggles. Maybe that would get X-rated. The Opposition is saying that it might be prepared for some of those six people to bundle. On what basis? With whom? For what reason?</PARA>

So how, in his flat earth policy with his six transponders all at once, is Senator Alston going to make something like compatible equipment stick? At least in the Government's proposal there is a four-channel single licence for a year&mdash;or possibly a little longer&mdash;which can be required as part of that licence provision because it is only one at the start. I hope the Government will do the right thing there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the Opposition's proposition is fairyland in the extreme. Senator Alston finished up by saying `when we have digested all these amendments that have just arrived'. My amendments have been in the hands of the Government, the Opposition and Senator Harradine since last week. I know it is only Wednesday, but drafting instructions for them have been generally widely discussed between me and those other people for some weeks. My public position on the question of pay TV has been known since the day Paul Keating put down his proposal and it was accepted by the Government. My digestion is fine. I am disappointed that I still have not seen anything on paper from members of the Opposition.

However, I believe that we have the Optus of the airwaves ahead of us, with wrong decisions, wrong processes and lost opportunity. I hope that the Caucus members who fell for the story about more jobs and more industry and all of the rest of it will keep a weather eye on this matter and perhaps encourage the Government to administer its proposition in such a way that it will at least allow some sort of viability. Finally, I think that the commercial operators ought to be very concerned about their fate at the hands of the potential coalition government with its flat earth theory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Broadcasting Services Bill has been described as the most important Bill in the field of broadcasting in the last 50 years. It is a pity, therefore, that the Australian Labor Party Government has done its best to prevent a smooth, sensible, well-considered approach to the issues contained in the Bill. The Bill is far-reaching. It encompasses the areas of radio licensing, the abolition of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, the establishment of the Australian Broadcasting Authority, community broadcasting, censorship and classification. Most importantly, it provides a mechanism for the introduction of pay television into the Australian culture. With many of the measures in the Bill, particularly those relating to the radio industry, the Government is deregulating. This is to be welcomed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition agrees with the general direction of the Bill, as it encourages diversity and competition, and allows the introduction of more broadcasting services. Therefore, we will not be opposing it. However, the Bill has several shortcomings. A number of amendments are, therefore, necessary, particularly in relation to the facilitation of new technologies and new players in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation has received considerable community comment since an exposure draft was released in November last year. The draft has changed considerably, especially in relation to pay TV. This is hardly surprising, given that there have been four Ministers for Transport and Communications during that time. There has also been a remarkable number of `policy on the run' turnarounds by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, in this area. Firstly, there was the policy of changes by television interview, courtesy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program. Then there was the about-face a couple of days later, just before the Bill was introduced, which resulted in the Bill that we have before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has served only to confuse the community, the industry and almost anyone associated with the Bill who is trying to keep track of what is happening in this area. It is certainly no way to go about introducing and considering a framework to establish a major new area in communication in Australia, nor is it a way to encourage business to invest in one of our few remaining growth industries. There are many groups who have competing interests in this Bill. As usual, the Government has tried to meet the specific desires of quite a number of pressure groups, in a self-interested attempt to run from a number of the hard decisions. Therefore, it has lost the overall picture in a number of ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go on to a number of issues that I believe are of concern in this Bill. A major issue in the community is the content and in particular the standards that will be involved with pay TV. Fortunately, the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Telecommunications Technologies has looked at this very issue and made several recommendations which the coalition is prepared to take on board. Those recommendations address the very real concerns that have been raised regarding what will and will not be permitted on pay TV, and they ensure that community standards of taste and decency will be upheld. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly important that in relation to program promotions, the current standard applied by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal be tightened up in line with the proposal of 18 June 1992 by the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations. The Senate Select Committee has recommended that X-rated material is not suitable in any way for pay TV. Also, current standards of free to air TV should apply to pay TV until community standards of taste and decency are properly assessed and the Australian Broadcasting Authority, we believe, should conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative research on community standards. This will establish a benchmark by which to assess censorship levels. Personally, I find it astounding that this has not been undertaken before in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the good intentions of members of the Office of Film and Literature Classification, I cannot really see how they can possibly establish what community standards of taste and decency actually are if they do not receive input from a wide range of the community in some sort of scientific, rather than haphazard, fashion. The Chief Censor admitted to the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards that, in 20 years of operation, no systematic survey of community standards has ever been conducted. Presumably members of the censorship board just pick them up by osmosis when they travel around on buses. That is probably why there is such widespread concern in the community about this issue. </PARA>

At present this technology is undergoing very rapid advances, due to the refinement of digital compression technology. The question that arises is whether the introduction now of pay TV in Australia will leave Australia with a system that is based on satellite technology that will be redundant in a very short space of time. If so, the introduction of pay TV at this time is obviously premature and the Government is merely in a rush to recover its investments in satellites during the 1980s.

It is ignoring the fact that has been pointed to by the recent Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's paper that hundreds of thousands of children are still watching television at half past eight at night. It ignores that. It also ignores community attitudes towards taste and decency. </PARA>

There is a conflict with those who take a more responsible attitude, for example, in Channel 7. There is a concern that the views and the attitudes that have been taken at Channel 9 are going to rebound on the television industry itself. The Government might say, `That is what we are on about. We are suggesting that the program standards should be determined and agreed upon by the industry itself'. But the question is: who has the final say within the industry? The fact of the matter is that, if it is left to the industry, unfortunately in many instances a situation as to program standards will result because of the everlasting chase for the almighty dollar.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable senators will probably be aware from press reports, after protracted debate the UN peacekeeping operations legislation was passed by the Diet on 15 June. It allows the Japanese self-defence forces to take part immediately in a range of non-military support functions associated with UN peacekeeping activities, as well as seconded public servants and civilian police. These functions include election monitoring, administrative support and civilian police duties, medical support to either the military or civilians, assisting refugees by providing food and medical supplies, repair and construction of infrastructure facilities, and transport, communications and construction and logistical support to civilians and UN forces.</PARA></TALK.START>

These include establishing and monitoring cease-fire arrangements as well as arms flows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Japanese legislation is significant in both symbolic and practical terms. It strengthens Japan's capacity to make a truly comprehensive contribution to international stability and prosperity, quite apart from the major financial and growing political role that Japan already plays. Importantly, the legislation enables Japan to send self-defence force elements to Cambodia to perform a range of support functions. The Japanese Government is about to dispatch a fact-finding mission to that country to examine what form Japanese participation in the UNTAC peacekeeping activities there might take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia supports Japan's participation in UN peacekeeping activities and, therefore, we do welcome the passage of the Japanese UNPKO legislation. This is consistent with our often expressed desire to see Japan assume greater international responsibilities commensurate with its economic status. Clearly, the scope of Japanese participation in UN peacekeeping operations is tightly circumscribed by this legislation and it does not involve a wider regional Japanese military role which, in any case, is not of course sought by Japan.

The trial service was funded by the DPIE and in three instances, in the shires of East Pilbara in Western Australia, Brewarrina in New Southi Wales and Flinders in Queensland, these local authorities took on the task of providing the information services for remote Australians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the trials to which Senator Macdonald refers have been quite successful and they have demonstrated the very important role that local government can play in undertaking some sort of agency arrangement in relation to other spheres of government, especially in rural areas, remote areas, where perhaps the local government shire council might be the only focal point which can make available information on the activities of other agencies or the benefits that might be obtained through contact with other agencies. In fact, the local shire might be the only locally accessible public sector infrastructure that can then provide that sort of information. So it has been a success, as I understand it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is not with the OECD countries that we should always be comparing ourselves. This is a very fashionable thing to do in Australia. The OECD&mdash;I hope it will not be offended if I say this&mdash;is very much a European club. We continue to compare ourselves in respect of a variety of matters with the OECD. The fact is that our future lies with the Asia-Pacific region predominantly, and we need to compare our performance with the countries of the world that are growing rapidly towards developed status, predominantly in the Asia-Pacific region.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That has been true for the last 25 years now. The honourable senator should think about the implications of that in terms of Liberal governments. I am not suggesting that we should reduce our social safety net to the sorts of standards in those countries where the priorities are on wealth creation and industrial development. They do not have the sophisticated social safety nets which we have in Australia and which are clearly better than those which exist in the United States and in the United Kingdom. But, in a world of mobile and footloose capital, we cannot be complacent about the competitiveness of our taxation system as it bears on business activity, because it is business activity which creates jobs and longer term employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter also referred to an international comparison of purchasing power. I do not know of a report ranking Australia eighth in that respect, but I do know that the United Nations world development report ranks Australia eleventh and that the OECD purchasing power parity program ranks Australia thirteenth. The United Nations human development index, which uses data on income, life expectancy, education and so on to construct a composite measure of human progress, ranks Australia seventh.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish this to be misinterpreted, because we have a serious unemployment problem in Australia, but the upshot of all of that is that Australia is a relatively well-off nation&mdash;which is the implication of Senator Coulter's question&mdash;and one in which the predominant number of people are happy to live. The best way of helping those without jobs is, of course, to provide them with jobs. The whole thrust of the Government's economic policies is addressed to providing a sustainable improvement in the unemployment rate. That means we must not threaten progress on inflation or micro-economic reform. We have to have regard to relevant big business tax regimes around the world, particularly with our major trading partners and competitors. To that end, the One Nation statement introduced a number of policies to produce productive public and private investment, depreciation allowance changes, the development allowance and infrastructure spending programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The November employment statement and the February One Nation statement provided increased funding for a number of labour market programs relevant not only to the safety net but also to training and production of skills, programs for apprentices, programs to boost skills and so on.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that Senator Bishop has taken an interest in this particular matter of relations with New Zealand. It is quite clear that abduction of children across the Tasman must be a cause of great distress to many custodial parents who find that, perhaps on an access visit, the non-custodial parent who has custody of the child for a short time then spirits the child away across the Tasman to New Zealand. Of course, the same devastating situation would apply with New Zealand non-custodial parents abducting their children to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a situation in which children are snatched away, kidnapped, there is obviously an obligation on governments to assist the custodial parent. In relation to New Zealand, for example, it is now the case that if a custodial parent is of the view that the child has been spirited away to New Zealand, on contacting the Attorney-General's Department we are able to deal with our counterparts in New Zealand. Investigations will be set in train in New Zealand. One hopes that the child will be located and brought before the New Zealand court. The New Zealand court can make an order to require the child to be returned to the custodial parent in Australia. In that situation the New Zealand authorities will pay for the proceedings before the New Zealand court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a reciprocal arrangement and would pay for proceedings being taken in an Australian court to aid a New Zealand custodial parent in respect of getting a kidnapped child returned to New Zealand. As Senator Bishop will know, the working out of those arrangements took some time. But the arrangements have been concluded.

I preface my question by referring to today's press reports stating that people who entrusted their savings to the Pyramid Building Society will lose at least two-thirds of the value of their deposits. First, is the Minister aware of the recommendation contained in the 1981 Campbell committee report that the Commonwealth should regulate and supervise building societies? Secondly, in view of the Federal Government's neglect to act on this recommendation, does the Minister feel any responsibility on behalf of the Commonwealth for the people who lost their savings in the Pyramid Building Society debacle? Finally, is the Minister now disposed to support my private member's Bill, entitled the Financial Corporations Prudential Standards Amendment Bill, which seeks to activate legislation that was passed by this Parliament in the 1970s but never proclaimed, and which is designed to protect small investors who entrust their moneys to building societies?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of parts to that question. First, in dividing up responsibility for the Pyramid Building Society collapse, it should be remembered that at least two of the directors of that society are currently on trial. One would not want to say anything that might prejudice those trials. I am aware that the Campbell committee made a recommendation. Indeed, it made many recommendations, and not all of them were accepted by the Government at the time. There were some constitutional and historical reasons for that because this has been a matter traditionally dealt with by the States and that has proved to be inadequate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so far as the allegation of Federal Government neglect is concerned, the Government has been quite active about this issue. The Australian Financial Institutions Commission has been established and the Commonwealth has endorsed, pushed and actively supported the establishment of a nationally coordinated but State-based system of high uniform prudential standards for building societies and credit unions. I think it is fair to say that we have been the pushers in this, and the Premiers entered into a formal agreement in November 1991 to establish this new supervisory framework. This was, of course, after the Pyramid collapse, but was on the basis of the experience with that building society and others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth endorsed the agreement, subject to the necessary legislation being consistent with the 1991 heads of agreement between the Commonwealth and the States on corporate regulation. The AFIC legislation meets this test. Subsequently, the Commonwealth-State ministerial council for corporations has asked officials to examine measures to achieve a more rational interface between the corporations law and the Australian Financial Institutions Commission legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been different points of view expressed by various States. I understand legislation has now been reached in Queensland which meets the appropriate test and that legislation in other States is in the course of introduction. From my own knowledge, the Commonwealth has been putting a lot of pressure on the States to resolve this issue. If it is not resolved in the next month or two to the satisfaction of building society contributors Australia-wide, the Commonwealth may need to take some further action in the matter.</PARA>

In view of the Minister's answer, I believe that those who ignore history are bound to repeat mistakes, if I can paraphrase that saying. There has been the example of companies legislation being attempted to be done on a cooperative basis between the States and failing lamentably. Surely we do not need to repeat this performance of trying to coax States into doing something that apparently they are incapable of doing. I ask for the Minister's personal expression of opinion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As one who spent a large number of years picking up unfortunate victims of the roadway, particularly in the case of children, who are the victims of trauma&mdash;and there is hardly a worse way to die&mdash;I am particularly pleased to provide the Senate with this information. The number of road fatalities has continued to decline despite an overall increase in the general population, significantly higher numbers of vehicles on the road and an overall increase in the number of kilometres that are travelled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fatalities per 10,000 vehicles in Australia were 4.2 per cent in 1981 and by 1991 this figure had dropped to 2.1 per cent&mdash;the figure had been cut in half. Over the years, the average rate of improvement in Australia's road trauma has been better than that for both the United States and the United Kingdom. It has been suggested by some that the improvement has been largely the result of the recession. I think that my opening statement indicates that that simply cannot be sustained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, a study being finalised by the Queensland University of Technology for the Federal Office of Road Safety shows that of the 21 per cent reduction from 1989 to September 1991 only 7.7 per cent, or just over one-third of that, could have been ascribed to any reduced economic activity. The realities of the decline in road fatalities are largely the result of a combined package of government initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of factors are responsible for the improvement in road safety, including the mandatory wearing of seat belts. Without question the introduction of random breath testing has had a salutary effect on these figures. There have been a number of successful road safety education programs and campaigns. Furthermore, the States and the Territories have been introducing the Commonwealth's 10-point safety package, which includes a national 0.05 blood alcohol limit, and I look forward to the day when it is reduced to effectively nothing. Also we have had uniform speed limits, and a zero blood alcohol limit for young drivers&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A killjoy? No, I just do not like seeing people killed by drunk drivers. As I was saying, the package includes a zero blood alcohol limit for young drivers and speed limits for heavy vehicles. The 10-point safety package also provided States and Territories with a $110m package for funding the road safety black spot program. As well, the Prime Minister's One Nation statement provided an additional $70m for this same program. About 1,700 projects have been approved since this program commenced. To maintain the current downward momentum in road traumas, the Australian Transport Advisory Council in April this year endorsed the national road safety strategy. All States and Territories have agreed to participate in the strategy which forms the basis for further improving road safety performance into the next century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through sensible negotiation with the States and Territories, we now have a nationally coordinated road safety package. We have spent money on eradicating black spots and  upgrading the national highways. I am sure all honourable senators will join with me in acknowledging the fact that it was not so many years ago that most of us in public life were despondent that the tragedy on our roads in terms of increasing numbers was simply going to continue to increase. The significant and continuing decrease in these numbers as a result of these positive programs provides encouragement to all governments, both State and Federal, to continue this positive action in improving our road safety figures.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. Last year, the top seven ranked manufactured exports were either motor cars or their parts, aircraft parts or iron and steel products, with all these products being beneficiaries of either the motor vehicle plan, the iron and steel plan or the offset plan for aircraft parts. In other words, they had some form of assistance. The Minister has told the Senate on many occasions of the healthy state of manufactured exports. In answer to a question from Senator Maguire on 22 June, the Minister told the Senate that elaborately transformed manufactured exports were Australia's largest export earner at $10.1 billion by conveniently subdividing mining exports into suitable categories and dividing rural exports into meat, cereal, sugar and others. What is the position of manufactured exports when the subsidised motor vehicle, iron and steel, aircraft, pharmaceutical and TCF industries are taken out? Has the level of remaining manufactured exports risen or fallen in the last year?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a very detailed question and I would like to obtain further detail in trying to answer it. Senator Boswell referred to the seven top manufactures. Steel is the largest manufactured export item from Australia, with exports totalling something in excess of $1 billion. There was assistance for the steel industry up until 1986 but there has been no assistance for the steel industry since then.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Parer says, they export at marginal cost&mdash;of course they do. Most manufacturers do. Since 1986 there has been no special assistance for the steel industry. The motor vehicle industry is assisted by export facilitation and one can go through a number of other major manufacturers which are not in an assisted category.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point about the elaborately transformed manufactured exports category is that the contributors to that figure of in excess of $10 billion are largely small firms across the country, many of which are not assisted in any way and some of which are assisted by the existence of a research and development incentive and things of that kind&mdash;assistance provided by generally available measures. I do not know what Senator Boswell's point is. Is it some ancient National-Country Party point from about the 1960s or is it some serious point?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, that is not necessary. If Senator Boswell's point is that somebody has somehow cooked the books to show that the contribution of the rural sector is not as great as it used to be, the fact of the matter is that it is as not as great as it used to be for a variety of reasons, very largely the question of access to markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, if the point is that the burden of manufacturing in terms of the levels of assistance supplied to it in the 1960s and 1970s is still there, the answer to that is no, it is not still there. The levels of assistance offered to manufacturing in this country are, by and large, competitive levels of assistance,</PARA>
<PARA>which are what are offered in Europe and a variety of other countries. I will certainly look at the details of the honourable senator's question in order that I might provide a more detailed answer, but I think the assumptions underlining the question are wrong.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. There is no hidden agenda or innuendo in the question. All I ask is whether the top seven ranked manufactured exports are assisted. The Minister has come into this Parliament constantly saying that the Government's reform programs have lifted secondary industry exports. I am suggesting to the Minister that the secondary industry exports that have been lifted are the ones that have been subsidised by the Government's plans. Therefore, are the remaining manufactured exports that are not assisted down or up? It is a very simple question.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Boswell wants to reduce his question to a simple one which would require a simple answer, let me say that the steel industry is not assisted in this country except by a tariff now that I think would average out at about 7 per cent across the product range. That is a lower level of tariff than, for example, the roughly 28 per cent that will be offered to the sugar industry in June&mdash;a much lower rate of assistance. I cannot go through all the seven largest exporters of manufactured products at the present time, but they are not all assisted. Certainly, the steel industry is not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to whether the other manufacturers' export performances are up or down, the performance of the manufacturing sector in exports is generally up right across the board. That is a very encouraging change, particularly as the increase in manufactured exports is not only taking place now but also took place through a period of high growth in the Australian economy during the latter part of the 1980s.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a ploy by Senator Ray to use up my time. I have one minute to go. I mentioned why this matter was urgent when I rose to my feet. The reason why this matter is urgent and should be dealt with today is that it is a clear example of a Minister misrepresenting the facts. It should be dealt with at this time. I had to quote the Minister and the press release that the NFF put out to make my point in terms of urgency. Finally, I quote from the press release the NFF put out in its own name. It said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>This is a matter of urgency. The Minister's press release clearly misrepresents the facts. He has the opportunity to correct that. I gave him that opportunity today.

Even if what he said were true, it is not a matter of urgency that should be dealt with now. But it clearly is not true.

Many of us have received many more pieces of correspondence and many of them relate to the way the Democrats behave, as well as many other things.

He gets to his feet to say that we are not permitted to say in blunt terms that he tells untruths in the Parliament. </PARA>

He undertook on 19 December 1991 to come into this chamber and make a full disclosure and apology on what he had to say about Robe River, but he has yet to do that.

One might say that one is a small point. He came into this place and said he read from a letter published in a newspaper, but it was in fact not so published. Instead of saying that he thought it was published in the form in which he had a copy, he had to fudge the issue yet again.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon the Senate has been asked to suspend Standing Orders to take note of an answer Senator Cook gave to a question from Senator Crane. I can understand Senator Crane wanting to take note of anything Senator Cook says. Senator Cook is indeed one of the shining stars of the Australian Labor Party and of the front bench of the Government. I commend Senator Crane for his honesty in recognising the need to take note of Senator Cook's answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the matter of substance of whether the matter is urgent or not, quite clearly it is not urgent. Senator Cook indicated in his explanation of the point earlier this afternoon that, if in the answer to the question it had been misconstrued that he was talking about a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> rather than a letter that was redirected to him, he was quite happy to correct that matter and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will show that to be a fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter of substance is whether the National Farmers Federation is operating conjointly with the Housing Industry Association in a campaign against the industrial relations legislation. It is clear from the evidence produced here this afternoon that the National Farmers Federation, the NFF, is part of that campaign. It has publicly claimed that it is part of the campaign by virtue of its press release. Indeed, from its perspective on industrial relations, it is clear that it is proud to be part of that campaign. As an organisation operating within Australia, it has every right in the world to be part of that campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So when Senator Peter Cook stands up in this place and claims that money from the National Farmers Federation is being used in a campaign in conjunction with the campaign sponsored by the Housing Industry Association against the industrial relations legislation, he is absolutely correct. He is agreeing with the National Farmers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether political points are to be scored by Senator Crane, a former official of the National Farmers Federation, on behalf of the National Farmers Federation in bringing this matter here this afternoon and claiming that it is urgent, but if there are he has scored them. So I congratulate him on the second point. The first point I congratulate Senator Crane on is his recognition of the talent of Senator Cook.

I am surprised that he got up and made such a stupid speech and  has been wasting the Senate's time, when we have a number of important Bills to deal with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Broadcasting Services Bill which is before us today is the first major rewrite of the Broadcasting Act in Australia since the 1940s&mdash;the first in 50 years&mdash;and Senator Lewis wants to debate for another hour the Minister's answer; he wants to argue over a few words. It has now been an hour since the end of Question Time. The Minister has given his answer. Senator Lewis may not like it but the answer has been given. We may not like Senator Lewis's comments. We have spent nearly one hour debating an absolutely trivial matter; it is a semantic debate which 99.9 per cent of Australians could not give a darn about. Senator Crane has a particular view that he has to show his mates in the National Farmers Federation that he is earning his keep here as a professional politician, to show that he is always supporting the Federation. He has made his hairy-chested remarks; he has beaten his chest for an hour. Let us now get on with the real business of the Senate; let us deal with some legislation.

Of course we are professional politicians&mdash;we are paid by the Australian taxpayer. I have known only a couple of people who could be described as amateur politicians.

I could not do so, and I know that all members on this side of the chamber could not be here if they were not paid. I suspect most Democrats could not be here unpaid either. Even a large number of Liberals would have to be paid as professional politicians. So Senator Lewis should not give us this tripe that because he is a professional politician he has the right to talk about this matter because he thinks it is something important.

We have just heard from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) an incredible attempt to justify a position that he adopted.

That is the only conclusion any intelligent person could come to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a matter of urgency because Senator Lewis asked the Minister, Senator Cook, a very simple question today. That simple question was: when did you become aware of the fact that the letter that was printed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> was not the same as the one that had been sent to the Minister by John Murray from the Master Builders Association? The Minister refused to answer that question and he still refuses to answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate has been turned into a charade, because if the Minister had answered, Senator Lewis would have got up, made his comments in a very short period and addressed the subject matter before us, instead of us going on for half an hour justifying why this is a matter of urgency.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the previous debate when I wanted to take note of an answer given during Question Time, I wanted to incorporate three documents.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We continually have answers put before us, particularly from the Minister for Industrial Relations, that do not represent the facts accurately.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, I wish to make a personal explanation. On 18 June last, in the course of debating the report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, I made certain remarks in relation to the ageing of the population and the pace of technological change and the impact that the latter would have on the former. Today, in Question Time, the Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett) in the House of Representatives and yesterday, in this chamber, Senator Sherry both sought to use some words attributed to me in the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 18 June in a mischievous and misleading manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The selective extracts in no way do justice to my remarks on the problems posed by the ageing of the population or the context in which those words were used. The words that were attributed to me were as follows&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pace of technological change is ever-accelerating. Who knows? It could be anything from euthanasia to dramatic forms in bio-technology. . . </PARA>
<PARA>In making that reference to euthanasia, I was responding to an interjection which specifically put forward that very proposition and which I was then at pains to point out was an abhorrent notion to our side of politics. It is quite clear from the thrust of my remarks that I was drawing attention, as have many other commentators, to the likelihood that medical costs of surgical treatment and care of the elderly may well fall as a result of the accelerating pace of technological change and dramatic reforms in bio-technology. In no way, shape or form was I advocating euthanasia, nor suggesting that that had relevance to the debate other than in the way in which it was proffered by a senator from the other side of the chamber. I therefore deplore the way in which those words were extracted, perhaps unwittingly&mdash;in other words, perhaps in ignorance of the fact that they were simply a response to an interjection&mdash;</PARA>

I want to make it painfully obvious that I was in no way associating myself with advocating that proposition but simply endeavouring to dismiss it on the run and to concentrate, as I later did, on the very serious consequences of the ageing of the population and the estimates of cost levels which might flow from that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>This annual report, which at times is wrongly labelled as the 1990 report, is in fact the report for 1991. I stress that the major changes taking place in the structure of this Institute, particularly the way it affects the Canberra School of Music, are matters that I want to talk about as shadow Minister for the arts. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that in the report the Director of the Canberra School of Music says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is pleasing to note that this evolutionary process has taken place in the university environment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, becoming a part of the Australian National University on 1 January this year&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">without the need to compromise in any way the original charter of the School to develop as a performance school at the international level.</PARA>
<PARA>It is absolutely vital that coming into a much more academic environment does not diminish in any way the performance elements of this school which have, in fact, resulted in a very large number of its graduates being regarded within the arts as of extraordinarily high quality. Dealing with this year, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Undergraduate students have won major prizes in competitions across Australia and have represented the School with credit as professional members of the country's major symphony orchestras. A student wind quintet was selected to represent Jeunesse Musicale (World Youth Orchestra) in Montreal, Canada, while 1991 graduates have won scholarships for study in the leading schools in USA, Austria, United Kingdom, Japan and Germany.</PARA>
<PARA>The report also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The busy public concert schedule was maintained during the year with the presentation of 348 concerts, recitals and broadcasts.</PARA>
<PARA>However, in the midst of this, I would like to draw attention to the happy link that has existed in the past between the school and the Canberra City Opera. I hope that there is no truth in suggestions of some reduction in this association which has been built up so magnificently over the years by Mr David Parker, who is the head of the Voice Department, and Marie van Hove, while both of them have been that department. By establishing this link, these people have been able to give performance opportunities to students and graduates of the school which I believe is invaluable to them. The report notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1991, the Canberra City Opera rehearsed each week at the School of Music under the direction of the Head of the Voice Department, David Parker.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that continues. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In July, the School of Music joined the Canberra City Opera in presenting the world premiere of the specially commissioned opera, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Summer Carol</EMPHASIS>, by Colin Brumby to a libretto by Thomas Shapcott. The producer was David Parker and conductor Marie van Hove. The production featured students Christina Wilson, John Brunato, Lotte Latukefu and John Handley with the School of Music Symphony Orchestra. Other vocal students joined members of the Canberra City Opera to form the chorus. This was the final production before the retirement from the School of Music of David Parker and Marie van Hove. The work has since been broadcast on ABC FM.</PARA>
<PARA>I regret the fact that there is nothing else in this report which pays tribute to the outstanding work of David Parker and Marie van Hove, both of whom, frankly, did not wish to retire, but were required to retire by achievement of an age limit which, I thought, merited being ignored. This was particularly so as at least the temporary replacement of Mr David Parker, the outstanding expatriate singer John Cameron, is well over Mr Parker's age. This outstanding contribution should have merited some comment in this annual report. I imagine that my colleague Senator Michael Tate would also endorse the outstanding achievements by Mr Parker and his wife, Marie van Hove, in their time at the Canberra City Opera and at the School of Music. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention in passing that I was also glad to note that the list of visitors to the Australian Centre for the Arts during 1991 included Miss Mardi McSullea, a flautist from Melbourne, who worked with David Worrall on a new compact disc to be released as part of the anthology of Australian music on disc for 1992. I welcome that disc. I congratulate Mardi McSullea on her achievements and for what she is doing for this anthology, which I look forward to hearing in the near future. </PARA>

The Hewson coalition has taken the view that if we can see opportunities for saving other people's money&mdash;when I say `other people's money', I mean money contributed by the taxpayers of Australia&mdash;and the government of the day does not go to great lengths to minimise those costs, then it is remiss and corrupt in its handling of other people's money. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What comes through in the report is that the amelioration of the environmental problems that exist in our country&mdash;they are not really as bad as a lot of the extremists would lead us to believe, but certainly the saving of energy is a very important one&mdash;can be achieved through market forces: by the necessity of the market, by the shortage of money and by budget constraints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the people who has proposed this for some years now is Alan Moran. Alan Moran was best known as a person appointed by the Hawke Government to the Business Regulation Review Unit, where he did an absolutely magnificent job advising the Government&mdash;sometimes in a confidential way but sometimes publicly, whatever his brief was&mdash;on the effects of Government legislation on the business sector and the costs that would be incurred by legislation if it were enacted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Business Regulation Review Unit was shut down because, I think, it was some sort of embarrassment to the Government, and Alan Moran went to the Industry Commission, where he did excellent work for some time. He subsequently ended up in the Tasman Institute. He was the one who propounded the theory that if we were to correct the major environmental problems in the world&mdash;I am not referring to problems within Australia today&mdash;it would be by market forces. This caused great trauma for a lot of extremists in the greenie movement who relied on promoting or exaggerating environmental problems for their own existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then Minister for the Environment and the Arts, Senator Richardson, got up in this place and maligned in a way that I have not seen for some time Mr Alan Moran, who is one of the great thinkers in Australia. Mr Moran is absolutely correct when he says that there is no doubt that in the next 10 years or so the problems that we strike in regard to the environment will be corrected by market forces. Anyone who wants to see that in action would be well advised to go to Japan. Market pressures have caused the Japanese to look at energy usage. Anyone who goes to Japan will find that the Japanese have even regulated energy usage in buildings during the winter time and the summer. They have done this mainly because of cost savings. I would say that that is the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is quite the opposite to what our friends the Australian Democrats would do. They take the view that if we are to do something about energy use we should start to increase the price of electricity until we reach the stage where people stop using it. This is exactly the wrong way to go and it will not work. The Democrats are talking about doubling or tripling the carbon tax. They live in their own little world. They are called by people on the other side of this chamber fairies in the bottom of the garden. I prefer to see them as little pixies who have no understanding of the real world. </PARA>

The fact that people who receive 6 or 7 per cent of the vote can come in here and determine what this Government or a coalition government, when it gets into office, will do and what legislation will be passed is an absolute abomination.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>Like my colleague Senator Parer, I too  congratulate the Auditor-General on drawing to the attention of the Parliament what seems to me to be an absolute disgrace&mdash;in this instance, the management of the Sydney Central construction project. As a member of the Public Works Committee, I am very alarmed at the laissez faire attitude that seems to be taken by some government departments towards building construction projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's report before the Senate today is but a further example that some government departments are not approaching complex tasks with the professional standards which we as a parliament should require. It should be of no comfort to honourable senators on either side of this chamber that the Auditor-General has concluded his report with 45 recommendations. There have been two reports and 45 recommendations just in relation to the letting of a tender and the construction of one building&mdash;the Sydney Central construction project. It is even more alarming that the Australian Construction Service seems to have agreed with virtually every one of these recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot help but ask myself why these problems could not have been identified by the Australian Construction Service. One would have to ask why the Minister, Senator Bolkus, has not reported to the Parliament on the concerns that have been raised by not only the Auditor-General but during the hearings of the royal commission that looked at this building last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General has concluded that because the Commonwealth Government's risks were not properly documented in the construction contract and because the project was not managed effectively, this resulted in indirect holding costs and a direct cost to the Commonwealth of the order of $12m. When I say that it is a direct cost to the Commonwealth, I mean, of course, that it is a direct cost to the taxpayer. As chairman of the coalition waste watch committee, I can tell honourable senators that $12m would go a long way to helping a few of our unemployed people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, what occurred was that the Department of Administrative Services, through the Australian Construction Service, set about a major construction project without securing the necessary tenancies to make the project viable. This is pointed out in one of the key findings of the report. The Auditor-General stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal to build Sydney Central should have been based on firm commitments from departments to occupy space in it. When the construction contract was awarded in 1989 there were no tenancy commitments for the building, and DAS has continued to have difficulty in securing departmental tenants to fill the building.</PARA>
<PARA>This afternoon I took the opportunity of ringing Mr Richard Williams of Australian Estate Management. He was very cooperative. He informed me that since this report has been written, most of the building has been let to government departments. The major tenant, of course, is the Australian Customs Service. Also DEET, the Department of Industrial Relations, AIDAB and Australian Archives will be moving in. It is gratifying to know Australian Estate Management has been able to fill up the building. It is also pleasing to note that nearly 50 per cent of the retail space has been filled, even though the departments have not yet moved in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a direct result of the inadequacies of the Australian Construction Service, there were problems with fitout as the building was continually re-designed to meet the needs of new prospective tenants. Ultimately, as I said earlier, it is the taxpayer who has to foot the bill to the tune of something like $12m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time construction was commenced it was assumed that the Australian Tax Office would be a major tenant. But when officers of the Tax Office appeared before the Public Works Committee we were advised that this probably would not be the case. Nevertheless, other government tenants have been found. But as the Auditor-General points out, the fitouts had to be altered to fit in with these tenants, and as a result it has cost the taxpayer an extra $12m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another great concern to me is the fact that directions given by this Parliament have been flouted. DAS was required to keep the Public Works Committee informed of the actual cost of restoration of heritage elements retained, the progress of fitout requirements and cost of the project. The Audit Office has raised the point&mdash;and I would have to concur; I have checked this with the Secretary of the Public Works Committee&mdash;that the Public Works Committee has not been informed of any progress in regard to the fitout cost requirements. I am sure that the Chairman of the Committee, Mr Hollis, would be absolutely appalled at this whole shemozzle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to see some of the problems that arose during this tendering process. The Auditor's report states, for instance, that Australian Construction Services decided in 1987 to engage a consultant quantity surveyor. In the report, the Auditor-General points out that the consultant was originally employed at an initial fee of $5,600. This increased to $821,225 over the course of the project. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is $821,225. The reason I am concerned about that is that no expressions of interest were sought from any other consultants; in fact, the tender process was completely ignored.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The Auditor-General points out that the procedures used by Australian Construction Services in appointing a consultant did not ensure that the expenditure gave the best value to the Commonwealth&mdash;in other words, the taxpayer&mdash;as expressions of interest were not sought from other consultants. A rise from $5,600 to $820,000-odd is quite a significant increase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As if that were not enough, the same situation arose with the engagement of a consultant programmer. According to the Auditor-General's report, he was engaged on a time basis to an upper limit of $36,800. The contract was then extended by $45,000. By the end of February 1989, it had been extended by a further $400,000. This again occurred without any competitive quotes from other consultants. So, under these circumstances, one would really have to ask whether Australian Construction Services and the Department of Administrative Services is doing the right thing by the taxpayer. I am also very concerned at the Royal Commission into Productivity in the Building Industry in New South Wales. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Schacht" NAMEID="4J4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. To return to the Royal Commission, its inquiry into productivity in the building industry in New South Wales obtained evidence that there were secret agreements between the tenderers for this project to build the Sydney Central building. In 1991, the Royal Commission obtained evidence that the successful tenderer&mdash;who is not named in this report by the way; I have read through it in the short time I have had it and I cannot find his name&mdash;effectively paid off unsuccessful tenderers to the tune of $750,000 each and a further fee of $1m was passed on to the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors. So payments totalling $3.25m were included in the tender price for Sydney Central but were apparently unknown to Australian Construction Services. I understand that this aspect of the project has been referred to the Australian Government Solicitor with the idea of trying to recover those moneys. It makes one wonder just how efficient this Department is when it was not even aware that those monies paid were kickbacks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area that concerns me&mdash;it is not in the Auditor-General's report&mdash;is the attempt to fill this building with firstly Australian Construction Services and now Australian Estate Management. Further, the major tenant which will move into this building in about a month, the Australian Customs Service, already has a lease on a property at 117 Clarence Street, Sydney. This lease does not cease until 14 September 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was handed an advertisement last week which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> announcing `a unique sublease opportunity'. This should be totally unacceptable to this Parliament. The advertisement reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Premises are available from August 1992 to 14/9/95 at a sacrifice rent&mdash;just name rental you are prepared to pay&mdash;plus generous incentives.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, because we had this embarrassing situation where we have a huge building that cost almost $200m and it had no tenants, the Australian Customs Service has been rushed into it. On top of the $12m that the Auditor-General has identified and the $3.25m in kickbacks that have been paid to buy off the other tenderers, the rent forgone will be paid to the owners of 117 Clarence Street, Sydney for the next three years. Somebody will certainly get some very cheap rent there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel we should all take note of this matter upon which the Auditor-General has reported. It is a matter that is of great concern to me as a member of the Joint Committee on Public Works. I am sure that we will be hearing more about it. As Senator Parer said, it is very good to see that the Auditor-General is doing such a wonderful job in identifying to the Parliament the absolute rorts in our system that the Government should be bringing to our attention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak briefly to the Auditor-General's Audit Report No. 49, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Management of Sydney Central construction project</EMPHASIS>, to support the remarks of my colleague Senator Calvert. As pointed out by Senator Calvert, this is really a damning report by the Auditor-General of an organisation that is one of the stars of Senator Bolkus's commercialised operations. Australian Construction Services has been commercialised. It now comes under a type 2 trust account, and it has proper profit and loss accounts, balance sheets and so on. That is a direction that the Opposition supported. The Auditor-General's report, which talks about the changed environment with the organisation becoming commercialised, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the new environment in which it now operates&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Australian Construction Services, and I presume from this that this is the project services part of ACS&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACS needs to adopt a more commercial approach to the provision of its design and construction supervision services.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a fairly damning remark from the Auditor-General. I find it absolutely amazing that the Australian National Audit Office has to point out to what should be a star commercial operator within government how to do its job. If people wonder why auditors are able to do that, I might tell them that it amazes me that auditors find themselves in the position of showing commercial operators how to operate. It is not as if the Auditor-General is remiss or does not know what he is talking about because, of the 45 recommendations, Australian Construction Services agrees with most of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does an organisation have to wait for the Auditor-General to come in to tell it how to run its operation? If these people, under the recommendations made here, were in the private sector, they would have gone broke. They would have crashed with the other big players in the property market who went under in the crash that occurred in the last couple of years. The only thing that saved ACS is the fact that it can come back to the public purse through the Budget and survive. That in itself is an indictment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go through the 45 recommendations because of time constraints. Some of them are plainly things that any organisation should do as a matter of course. It reflects what happens when commercial operations operate within the public sector. It does not mean that there is anything wrong with the individuals who work in the public sector. Many of those individuals are top operators who would go well in any organisation. This has been proved by those who move out of the public sector into the private sector and are eminently successful. People such as Mr Besley come to mind. He had a lifetime within the public sector and has done extraordinarily well in the private sector. But there is a whole range of those people at all levels. One does not have to be a Tim Besley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's report reflects on the bad management of the construction of the Sydney central office block. All it does is reflect the bad management of this Labor Government and what it has done to the Australian economy. One mirrors the other. Who else would go out and spend $166m of other people's money&mdash;taxpayers' money&mdash;on a building without firm commitments from any tenants to occupy the building? I find that absolutely extraordinary. It is the sort of extravagance that this country cannot afford. The taxpayers cannot afford it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General points out that the indirect holding cost and direct costs as a result of this alone run into $12m because of the lack of effective management. That is an absolute disgrace. We are talking about other people's money. All levels of government in this country have to come to the realisation that when they spend money they are not spending something put out by the Mint. They are spending money contributed to them by people across a broad spectrum of Australia&mdash;by people making as little as $5,200 per annum up to whatever level one wants to nominate. Other people's money is being spent, and it is about time that governments started to ask themselves whether they have to spend certain amounts of money. If they do, what is the most cost-effective way to do it? If they do not go down that track&mdash;and I have used this term before&mdash;they are corrupt in the use of money. All governments, whether they be State, Federal or local, are trustees of other people's money and assets. They have an absolute obligation to spend that money wisely. </PARA>

<PARA>This report before us deals with the results of a review of internal audits in eight Commonwealth organisations. In fact, Madam Acting Deputy President, it is the second of a three-stage review of internal audit activity in the Commonwealth public sector undertaken by the Australian National Audit Office in response to the recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in Report No. 296, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament&mdash;Reform of the Australian Audit Office.</EMPHASIS> As you may recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, this report was tabled in April 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Vice-Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, over the years, I have been concerned at the low level of resources devoted to internal audit in the past. This theme has been consistent with many other reports over the years. In fact, Audit Report No. 6 of 1991, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Survey for Internal Audit in the Commonwealth Public Sector</EMPHASIS>, stated that there was a need for some authority to establish and promulgate internal auditing relative to the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only has this view been noted in many reports over the years during the 1980s, but also it is a view that has been shared by the Institute of Internal Auditors. There is a most definite need for the work of internal auditors to be not only encouraged but also recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, when I examined this report before me today, although being pleased that there is an increased recognition of the value of internal audit&mdash;because managers and boards do want additional assurances on the adequacy of financial and other management controls&mdash;I am nevertheless disappointed that this report does not seem to provide any advancement on the findings reported in 1989 and 1991 in both aforementioned reports. It is now 1992, and we still have the same findings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be constructive, what is needed, instead of a restatement of what has been happening, is actually a more rigorous assessment of how internal audit is progressing in the Commonwealth. I was therefore disappointed to note that several of the large spending departments were actually omitted from the sample of the eight organisations reviewed. For example, Defence, Social Security, and Taxation have not been reviewed. If these departments had been reviewed, I believe the findings and the result of this sample may have been somewhat different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure we can all remember the concern expressed by the Australian Taxation Office at its forthcoming audit by the Australian National Audit Office. An extension had been requested, which was later withdrawn, and the findings of the National Audit Office that internal audit performance had improved since its 1990 survey, especially in the areas of audit planning, organisation, staffing and relations of line with the management, may well have been different. The very careful remarks that there is scope for further improvement, especially in staff productivity and training, task management and quality assurance, may have been much more severe, for example, if the departments of Defence, Social Security and Taxation had been reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned as to why this Report No. 50 has not questioned why we only have a restatement of what has happened in the previous reports. Many of the conclusions and recommendations of the report are exactly the same as those reached in the IDAC papers issued in the 1980s. If the report were to question why these earlier recommendations and conclusions had not been more rigorously implemented, the report would then have had substance and there would have been a definite value in terms of the document that we have before us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am therefore disappointed that the report cannot report any progress in the findings with regard to the Department of Finance. It was first noted in the 1989 survey of internal audit that the Australian National Audit Office considers that the Department of Finance should play a more active role in the development of internal audit in Commonwealth organisations. The report is still giving its findings as to what should happen in the future:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Department needs to develop its own expertise in internal auditing and to establish a broadly based consultative process for advice on internal audit issues.</PARA>
<PARA>Why has the report not investigated why this has not occurred and discovered the reasons why? In 1991 Audit Report No. 6 stated that the Department of Finance should assist in developing the information and skills of internal auditors in the Commonwealth Public Service and to provide financial assistance to smaller agencies to encourage them to enrol auditors in the Institute of Internal Auditors and to make use of the institute's quality assurance program. As I have already stated several times, this Report No. 50 merely reiterates what has been said before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The entire situation could be improved and addressed if more formal dialogue were to occur between the public and private internal auditors and if the recommendations which have been given over the years were actually instituted. The phrases used in terms of the need for communications are motherhood statements. They need to be developed, and it should be explained why these communications have not taken place on a more meaningful basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that the report makes much of the independence and need for objectivity. We support this wholeheartedly. There is no question about that or about the accuracy of the report. However, it fails to delineate a definite contemporary role for internal auditors in the context of the current accountability regime of the Australian Public Service and with respect to a host of other management review and fraud control imperatives of government. In fact, it gives no recommendation as to the effective plans for incorporating internal auditors into this particular role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, while I welcome the report, I believe that it is no more than a mere restatement of what has taken place. It does not really show the direction for improvements in objectivity and increasing recognition of the important role of internal audit, particularly in government organisations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to make a few brief comments about the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Audit Report No. 50 1991-92&mdash;Efficiency Audit&mdash;Internal Audit in Selected Government Organisations</EMPHASIS>. My friend Senator Watson has made many of the points that I would have made and I certainly concur with all of his comments. This report is the second in a three-stage review of internal audits by Commonwealth organisations which is being carried out within the Commonwealth public sector. The first stage was a questionnaire survey of internal audit in the Commonwealth public sector carried out in 1989-90, which was reported in Audit Report No. 6 of 1990-91. The next stage, the third stage, will be the publication of a best practice guide for public sector organisations which will be published in August this year. That guide will be based on the main lessons from this particular review. So this is an important review, and I share Senator Watson's disappointment about some aspects of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am interested in the eight organisations that were actually chosen for the audit. They were the Australian Customs Service, the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau, the Australian Trade Union Training Authority, CSIRO, CSL Ltd, the Department of Administrative Services, the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Special Broadcasting Service Corporation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague comments, some of those are hardly major Commonwealth organisations in terms of spending. They are all important in their own right, but some are fairly small organisations. I wonder how representative they are of the public sector as a whole and certainly of the larger cross-section of spending agencies. Yet, as I understand it from the review, the findings of the review into the internal audit of these particular eight organisations will form the basis for the best practice guide for internal audit that is to be published in a couple of months' time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some concerns about the limitations of this review and report. On the other hand, there are some worthwhile findings that should be noted. The review found that senior managers treated internal auditing with appropriate importance and, even though in some cases there was some uncertainty about exactly what activities the audit should cover, that in itself I think has flushed out a need for greater specificity in that area of determining the audit activities which it would be desirable to cover. Reflecting the importance accorded to internal audits, managers have improved their audit, planning, staffing and reporting since the questionnaire survey that was conducted a couple of years ago. That is an improvement that is worth noting and applauding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of further improvement, the Audit Office recommends in this report that organisations should give attention to improving management information systems, to improving the business and technical skills of auditors, and to improving audit quality assurance arrangements. Although there were, as one would expect, some differences between organisations, essentially what the Auditor-General found in relation to the effectiveness of internal audits, so far as can be judged by this particular survey, was that they are treated seriously&mdash;one would hope that that is so&mdash;that they are proving useful&mdash;one would certainly hope so&mdash;and that some further improvements can be made. With that I would concur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Finance is reported in the Auditor-General's report as supporting the general direction of the Audit Office's recommendations, although it does disagree on some details. The eight organisations that responded welcomed the ideas put forward but cautioned against necessary or further legislation being too prescriptive. That relates to the recommendations from the Audit Office. The recommendation states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Department of Finance propose to the Government that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the new financial administration legislation require all Commonwealth organisations to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">develop and maintain appropriate internal audit plans or programs</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">establish appropriately constituted audit committees to, among other things, monitor and review internal audit plans or programs.</PARA>
<PARA>It has also recommended the issuing of directions specifying the objectives and standards governing internal audit programs and the operations of audit committees, and the establishment and support of a consultative group on internal audit in the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports very strongly the further improvement of internal audit procedures within public sector organisations. The audit function is often regarded, and I guess rightly so, as a very dry sort of function that does not have much interest to the general community. But audit is the essential watchdog of the proper use of taxpayers' funds because they are the only funds government has to spend. Therefore, both internal audit and audit done by the Audit Office and other audit agencies of the public sector are very important functions indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will certainly continue, when it reaches government in a few months' time, the process of strengthening the internal audit function, and indeed the audit function of the Commonwealth generally. We are on record time and time again as supporting the Audit Office, and for requesting the Government to get on with the job of properly reshaping the legislation that it said almost two years ago it was putting in place to review and update the necessary processes concerning the Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been at least a year's slippage in that work. Whilst the new Audit Act and accompanying legislative arrangements were supposed to be in place as from 1 July this year, there has already been announced a slippage for 12 months. The way things are going, that could well slip out even further. I think that is a very serious problem because it is causing the Auditor-General and his office grave problems as there is not a proper definition for the Auditor-General of his mandate and role. The sooner the Government gets on with the very important job of finalising those new audit arrangements on behalf of all taxpayers of Australia, the better off we will all be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although it is not directly relevant to this particular report, No. 50, I hope that the Minister at the table, Senator Collins, may receive on behalf of the Government yet another request from the coalition to do all that it can to finalise those arrangements, put them in place and get them up and running on behalf of us all as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">FIFTY-FIFTH GENERAL REPORT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TABLING SPEECH BY SENATOR JOHN DEVEREUX</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's 55th General Report covers the activities of the Committee during 1991. The Committee presented 12 reports during the year on a range of public works such as Defence facilities, the Australian Embassy in Jakarta and the Australian High Commission in Islamabad, Pakistan, CSIRO laboratories in Melbourne and houses for the Defence Force in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated cost of the proposals on which the Committee reported during 1991 was $231 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee met on 53 occasions during the year to conduct public hearings, carry out inspections, to consider reports and be briefed by departmental officials.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As in past years, the report raises a number of matters of concern which emerged during the year. I will briefly mention a few of them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the construction of a shell filling facility at St Marys Munitions Filling Factory in New South Wales. This facility, estimated to cost $7.7 million, was referred to the Committee in October 1988. Not long after that, in December, the Committee held a public hearing into the proposal at which officials from the Department of Defence assured the Committee first, that the facility was required, secondly, that despite urban encroachment, the factory would remain at its location and thirdly, the merits of the proposed work had been assessed as essential even though the establishment of Australian Defence Industries was in the offing. Accordingly the Committee recommended to Parliament that the work should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was amazed when it was advised by the Department of Defence in May last year that the shell filling facility, which had meanwhile been completed, was no longer required. Apparently during 1990 the newly formed ADI had carried out an extensive review of its operations to rationalise and improve efficiency which resulted in the St Marys Munitions Filling Factory being no longer required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes the project was a debacle of monumental proportions. The new shell filling factory was proceeded with in a climate of uncertainty based on erroneous assumptions. The Committee accordingly gives notice that all public works referred to it for consideration, be they for the Department of Defence, or for other departments or agencies, will be required to withstand the `St Marys test.' That is, the need, justification, benefits and public value of public works will need to be rigorously tested by the management of departments and agencies before they are referred to the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This incident also demonstrates the risks involved in departments proceeding with the provision of major facilities during a period of organisational establishment or reorganisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A second matter for concern involved another incident involving the Department of Defence. It relates to the refurbishment of Endeavour House, a former migrant hostel, located in Coogee, NSW, to provide accommodation for junior sailors in the Sydney area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scope of the work was originally costed at $5.8 million in August 1988, but due to a litany of what can charitably be described as unfortunate circumstances, by January 1991 the cost had blown out to more than $7.2 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following a briefing by Defence officials, the Committee concluded that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a.some effort was made to adjust components of the project to keep it below the $6 million reference limit</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">b.the scope of the project was poorly defined</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">c.inadequate administrative procedures in Defence had caused a project estimated to cost at least $7.385 million from being referred to the Committee&mdash;contrary to the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Defence subsequently advised the Committee that the Secretary of the Department had been asked to review administrative processes for the control of both capital works and repairs and maintenance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A third matter of concern relates to the approval of designs by non-Commonwealth authorities. During 1991 Australian Construction Services, formerly the Department of Housing and Construction ceased to be the Commonwealth's design and construction authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Departments and agencies are now free to select design and construction agents from the private sector. The Committee believes that in this environment there is scope for the rigorous oversight of the design of major works, formerly carried out by Australian Construction Services, to be diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the past Australian Construction Services was responsible for the application of planning and design principles with some measure of consistency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At one hearing a witness submitted that there now appears to be generally no formal process by which the community can be assured that Commonwealth building work will conform to current community standards. Buildings and facilities planned and constructed for the private sector are subject to a number of formal processes such as applying for building approval, the checking of plans, inspections and the issuing of certificates of occupancy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst under the principle of the `shield of the Crown' the Commonwealth is not required to seek formal approvals and pay fees, now that departments and Government Business Enterprises are regarding buildings and facilities as saleable assets, for the full value of these assets to be realised, they would need to formally comply with local government and state government regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee accepts that there are constitutional issues involved and will shortly write to the Minister for Administrative Services on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question of the provision of work based child care facilities continued to be pursued by the Committee. In a number of instances departments and agencies demonstrated that they are aware of their responsibilities to their employees. It was particularly gratifying to see a report during the year from the Australian Taxation Office, one of the largest public service employers which stated that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ATO sees the provision of child care facilities for employees as good human resource management practices, enabling optimal returns on the Office's investment in recruiting, developing and retaining staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee continued to focus attention on the energy efficiency of buildings and reiterates that sponsoring departments and design and construction authorities must be more energy conscious in the design of buildings. The Committee therefore gives notice that in future more details of energy conservation principles and measures will be given close examination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, I would like to pay tribute to my hard-working colleagues&mdash;the Chairman, Colin Hollis&mdash;Member for Throsby, Bill Taylor&mdash;the Honourable Member for Groom, and the Honourable Members for Indi, Greenway, Grey, and Maranoa as well as my Senate colleagues&mdash;Senators Burns and Calvert.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before lunch I was referring to recommendations by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure relating to the need for consultation prior to appointments to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, which under this legislation will be replaced by the Australian Broadcasting Association. I was also indicating that this issue of the representative character needed on these boards and tribunals was referred to by the Law Reform Commission, the Joint Select Committee on Video Material and other inquiries that have been undertaken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Persons appointed to these tribunals and to the ABA should be able to truly reflect community standards based on extensive surveys and knowledge of community attitudes to matters of taste and decency. The matter of terms of office is also a matter of concern. That matter was referred to by the Law Reform Commission, as was the need for a more representative nature of appointments to the Film Censorship Board, which was referred to in the report of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Telecommunications Technologies which was presented to the chamber yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply refer the Senate to the evidence that was given on 1 June by Messrs Dickie and Haines of the Film Censorship Board. Most States would have thought that the Film Censorship Board was tightening up guidelines in respect of violence when it changed them in 1988. The statement was made very clear by the officers of the Film Censorship Board that that was not so; that it was an arrangement&mdash;I cannot recall the words&mdash;to simplify and make more readily understandable the guidelines. But it was not to tighten up the guidelines. I think most States would have thought that that was what was going to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the Film Censorship Board indicated that the States after 1988 said that the interpretation of the guidelines should be tightened, we did ask how many of the films and videos out in the community, out in the stores, had been recalled to apply that test and had been reclassified. The answer was `None'. So we need to have regard to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the persons concerned, Mr Haines, has been on the Board for 12 years. That runs completely contrary to the views that have been expressed by all of those committees that there should be a change of membership. The Deputy Chairman of the Film Censorship Board, Mr Haines, has now pointed to the ABT's inquiry into classification of program material on TV. One can obtain that expertise and one really does need to have others who are fresher in approaching that particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My main concern is the need to provide a high priority for the protection of children against material that is likely to be harmful to them. Information that was supplied to me today from the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal survey, which I think was published yesterday&mdash;it was certainly published this month&mdash;shows some quite remarkable figures. During the period 7.30 to 8.30 p.m., which is PGR time, ratings for children are at their highest for the day with a peak between of almost 45 per cent. But the interesting thing is that between 8.00 and 8.30 p.m., ratings for children begin to decline but are still over 40 per cent of the potential child audience. That is quite remarkable. I will be referring to that later when I will be proposing amendments relating to the protection of children. The pay TV matter has been covered in terms of program standards by Senator Tierney, and I do not propose to deal with that particular question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I simply say and acknowledge that some very good work is done by those in the television and radio industries in Australia and that has to be acknowledged and greatly encouraged. My real concern, however, is that there are villains in the piece who are pushing the boundaries of propriety as far as they can to make a fast buck. My concern is that, if we give the industry a freer hand in program standards, this could well result in more violence and exploitative sex programs being transmitted over television into Australian homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill gives to the new Australian Broadcasting Authority even less control over program standards than is currently exercised by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. The Government might argue that it is putting the onus on the industry to clean up its act. That is desirable, of course, but I have certain amendments which would empower the ABA to come in at an earlier stage to rectify a certain problem. At this point in time, the public, particularly parents, are becoming fed up with the diet of violence and smut that is being dished out by certain television stations. </PARA>

I am sure that in six days time or six weeks time someone will find a clause that should have been written somewhat differently. That is the case with any major legislation that deals with an industry which is forever changing. There is no time reached when one can say, `This is it, we have covered everything possible'. I suspect that this legislation will last for a few years and then it will need further major revisions, as technology overruns any piece of legislation in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal with a number of matters relating to this Bill, including some of the amendments proposed by the Opposition and some other honourable senators. As to pay television, I certainly support the Government's proposal. I think we have achieved a reasonable balance. In establishing a new communications industry in Australia&mdash;that is, pay television&mdash;we are ensuring that there is diversity of ownership and good competition policy to ensure that the industry can get going and can be competitive; and we are not using the old models of establishing a monopoly and then giving some lucky commercial interest, by law, the rights to run that industry and basically dominate it without competition from anybody else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the information available as to where technology is at the moment, we have found a reasonable balance between the issue of diversity of ownership&mdash;establishing new players in the media industry in Australia&mdash;and enabling new, large amounts of investment in a competitive model so that no-one grabs all the bickies for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that has to be mentioned is that the model in this Bill will probably last for several years but certainly will not last for the decade because technological development will override it. Within three or four years digital compression will turn the programs coming off six transponders into 24 signals coming off those transponders. That means a much greater diversity of program content going into people's homes. Just as that is occurring, I suspect by the end of the decade, Telecom and Optus will be arranging for people in their homes to receive, via fibre optic, many more channels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, I suspect that by the turn of the century new forms of narrowcasting using microwave and so on will make further channels available to people. Above all else, no matter what regulatory models we provide in Australia, internationally there will be unlimited amounts of program material coming in via satellite. Unless one wants to go and pull down everybody's satellite dish from on top of their houses, it will be very difficult to control people having direct access to overseas programs, whether we like it or not. Some people may think that this is a fearful prospect, that program content may contain material that they do not like. I would also say that there is an upside to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few years authoritarian regimes around the world have fallen because people in those countries have, through new technology, access to information they previously did not get that has enabled them to put pressure on their authoritarian governments to make changes in favour of democracy, pluralism and human rights. So there is a very big upside to the new developments in telecommunications and in communications around the world, and that should be acknowledged. It will make the world a much better place; it will be much better for all people to have access to that information; and it will make it harder for the authoritarian regimes to cover up their mistakes and atrocities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the pay television model one area which is of concern to everybody is the development of industry policy, firstly as to the program content&mdash;so that we get encouragement for the production of Australian programs to be on pay television&mdash;and also as to the equipment itself. Under this Bill, as drafted, the Minister is able to set very clear cut specifications on the industry side about the technical equipment. For example, within this competitive model where we might have six companies providing through satellite or through cable, he can ensure that we do not have to have six black boxes or decoders sitting on top of our television sets, but a common black box through which all forms of pay television or subscription television can be received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A great opportunity exists with those specifications to encourage the development of Australian industry. Ultimately, it also could develop into an export industry with the provision of that equipment overseas in the expanding market of our own region&mdash;that is, the Asia-Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say a few words about pay television in terms of the report tabled yesterday by the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Telecommunications Technology. I was a member of that Select Committee and disagreed with the report that was tabled yesterday in a number of major ways. I have put in a dissenting report as I believe Committee members allowed their own prejudices about what they want to see on television and pay television affect their judgment on what the community should generally see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make no bones about the fact that many of the witnesses brought before the Select Committee were prejudiced fundamentalists who want to impose on everybody else  their own sexual views about the way a modern society should operate, quite contrary to any notion of democracy, of pluralism, of choice amongst consenting adults. I am disappointed that in a number of the recommendations the Committee has accepted some of those views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most compelling evidence received by the Select Committee was given by people whom I consider to be proper professional experts with international credibility, such as Ms Eva Goldberg, a clinical psychologist dealing with sexual matters, and Professor Brent Waters. I found their evidence much more compelling and balanced than the ratbaggery which came from people like Dr Judith Reisman, an American who seems to be more interested in imposing a limited, narrow, fundamentalist view on the rest of a modern community. Her assertions could not be backed up by fact; they were just a prejudicial view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr John Dickie, the Chief Censor, and other members of the Film Censorship Board and the Office of Film and Literature Classification are to be congratulated and supported by this Parliament for the work they have to do in a very sensitive area. They carry out that work with great discretion and great judgment and are overwhelmingly supported by ordinary Australians, who believe that we do have basically right the classification of material that is provided and available in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is not as was said in evidence to us by some of what I call the ratbags: that the Office of Film and Literature Classification basically allows anything to be shown on television, heard on radio or printed in the media in Australia. The Office made it very clear that it has very simple but understandable rules that are applied to classification. For example, one of the great myths and lies that is told by certain people is that X-rated videos are violent. They are by definition, under the classifications the Office of Film and Literature Classification uses, not violent. If there is any violence in them, they do not get a classification and, if distributed, they are illegal. With the R-rated material, there is violence allowed within their general context, but again it is limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pay television is quite different from free to air television. With pay television, firstly, we pay to receive it; and, secondly, when we receive it, through the black box we can ensure that R-rated and X-rated material cannot be made available to children. Devices on the black box and the provision of silicon chips can ensure access to  parents but prohibit it to children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that the Parliament of Australia should make rules, on the basis of a very small minority comprised of a few irresponsible parents, that ban all else for the rest of the community. Unfortunately, in the hearings we had&mdash;and it is on the record&mdash;it became apparent that certainly Senator Harradine, Senator Tierney and Senator Walters want to impose that view on everyone else. The remark was made in one of the hearings that although the Communist Party of the former Soviet Union has now been disbanded and there are no Stalinists left in the Soviet Union, views expressed by those senators may mean they are the last Stalinists left in the world who want to restrict people's access to information and want to impose their views on the rest of the community. As I put in my dissenting report, I do not believe in a modern society that that is reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time available, I quickly turn to a couple of other Opposition amendments. The Opposition is to move an amendment to remove from the legislation the provisions on the advertising ban during election campaigns. I strenuously oppose that and, in doing so, want to point out to the Opposition that since the Bill was carried there have been quite a few elections in Australia. There have been two general elections&mdash;those of Tasmania and ACT. There has been a by-election at the Entrance in New South Wales; the Federal Wills by-election in Victoria; the Ashburton by-election in Western Australia; two by-elections in South Australia, in Kavel and Alexandra; and a Tasmanian Upper House by-election. There may even have been more. In every one of those cases, not one member of the public has complained about the operation of the political ad ban Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, we have people on the record from the Liberal Party actually saying that it is not a bad idea. Mr Lister, the Tasmanian Liberal campaign director, has stated that he did not believe the ban caused any disadvantage for any particular party. As recently as June, Mr Everingham, President of the Liberal Party of Queensland, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But I think perhaps what the Federal Government has done with electronic advertising laws will suit the Liberal Party because we are going to depend very much on our own resources rather than the power of the big purse.</PARA>
<PARA>Even Mr Everingham, President of the Liberal Party of Queensland, former Leader of the Liberal Party in the Northern Territory, former member of the House of Representatives, has said that there is a positive aspect about this ban that helps the Liberal Party. I think the operation of the ad ban has already proved very successful, and that amendment should be defeated and despatched forthwith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that the Government, through the Minister, has circulated a very welcome amendment today to remove the clause which would have given the ABA certain powers to enable journalists to be investigated, for them to be called to provide information. I believe that the Government amendment to remove that clause will assuage many of the fears of journalists. Of course, journalists are not above the law. If someone wants to take them to court in an effort to get them to divulge the sources of their information and to sue them, they take their chance in a court like everybody else. I believe that that amendment which will be moved today will overcome that problem. </PARA>

One of the other amendments that is to be moved by the Opposition to which I strongly object&mdash;I notice Senator Harradine has also put this amendment in&mdash;is to reinsert that matters of broadcasting cannot be `blasphemous, indecent or obscene'. I believe the present drafting of the Bill is more than adequate. The powers of the ABA will be able to deal in general with community standards in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of blasphemy, that is a word that really has come out of the war of religions of about 300 years ago. That some still want to have the power of blasphemy in an Act of parliament when we have it quite clear that there is no official religion in Australia, that the separation of the church and the state has long been established in this country, and when at least 30 per cent of Australians declare themselves to be non-religious, I find rather odd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that as far as general community standards are concerned, matters of religion will be dealt with as program content in the broad balance of issues so that debate will take place. I find it extraordinary that people in the latter part of the twentieth century want to put into a Bill an opportunity for somebody to say, `You can't have a program that may be criticising a religion or a figure of religion because it is blasphemous'. That is out of date and undemocratic. I think the term `blasphemy', in particular, has long since served its purpose and relates to a period several hundred years ago when people killed each other in the name of religion. I think those particular amendments ought to be opposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Bill is not perfect&mdash;no Bill as complex or wide-ranging as this could ever claim to be 100 per cent perfect&mdash;I believe that the Government has put forward a Bill that enables broadcasting communications to deal with the new technologies that are rapidly developing in the latter part of this decade. The Government is to be congratulated for being the first government in nearly 50 years to have a complete rewrite of the Broadcasting Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the short time available I would like to make a couple of points about radio services in rural and remote areas. We are debating the Broadcasting Services Bill 1992 and the Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendment) Bill 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Schacht and others have pointed out, this is the first complete rewrite of the Broadcasting Bill for 50 years. One of the reasons why we needed a complete rewrite is that technology has progressed so far. Communications are global, as are the industries making communication outfits. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous regulations were set up when there were quite a few bidders in a more compact market. With the technology that is around now, there is a lot more space available and a lot more takers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will establish the ABA, the Australian Broadcasting Authority, which will not be quite as restrictive as the ABT. It will be set up to deal with this new technology and, most of all, to encourage competition between suppliers of services. It is a step forward, but it does not meet all our requirements in terms of the future of broadcasting policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly concerned about the different needs of regional and remote areas relating to radio. The country radio stations do not have the resources, including finance, that are available in the metropolitan areas. FM in regional and remote areas is a very scarce commodity. AM is generally available but its listeners are scattered far and wide in a radius of up to 200 kilometres from the main transmitter. These main transmitters in rural and remote areas are generally set up in towns with populations of 3,000 to 5,000 people. They broadcast to towns with populations of 100, 50 or even 30 people with very little in between, although homesteads can pick up these broadcasts as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Merredin in Western Australia, the commercial radio station 6MD has an AM licence and broadcasts to places up to 200 kilometres away, but it is not in a position to have an FM service. If it did have an FM service, it would supply the town of Merredin, which has a population of around 4,000 people, and do nothing for the little towns and homesteads further out. It is not in a financial position to provide translators which will broadcast into those small towns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people in a small town with a population of 1,000 or 500 want a translator to pick up a commercial transmission from a capital city, or even the ABC, they are not allowed to because the main holder of the AM service in the centre holds the licence and they cannot just step over its territory. The licence holder is the only one that can apply for an FM licence in that region. FM, whether it be ABC or commercial, is available in these areas because the microwave links run east-west through a carrier and the satellite. Unfortunately, the smaller communities are not allowed to get together and put such a service on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that such a service is necessary these days to cover small country towns, isolated homesteads and isolated mining camps. There are more of them these days on the fly-in, fly-out system that we have, thanks to this Government and the fringe benefits tax. They can tap into the FM services quite easily with earth stations which do not cost a great amount for a single camp or a single homestead. Small earth stations will rebroadcast in small areas and they are badly needed. Hopefully, the Government will do something about that in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the limited time available, I wish to briefly address the pay TV system that is about to hit Australia and, no doubt, is hitting the rest of the world.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the Broadcasting Services Bill 1992. It is a most important Bill. I think it will stand Australia in good stead in the next decade, although amendments may have to be made in that period. It has been a very extensive Bill involving very extensive restructuring. We are in the middle of the guillotine. The Government and the Democrats have moved for the guillotine of this Bill and so our time is very limited. On this side of the chamber we all decided that the backbenchers would talk for 10 minutes each. But Senator Schacht would not abide by that. He spoke for nearly double that time. When the Government moves the guillotine, I believe that it is inappropriate for one senator to take more than his fair share of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the time is so short I will speak on only one section of this Bill, and that is program standards. What the Government has decided in this regard is that the ABA will determine the standards of programs for children and the Australian content of programs. Only those two areas will be covered by decisions of the ABA. The Government has said that the industry itself should develop codes of practice. Those codes of practice can be looked at by the ABA and the ABA must be assured that they are in accordance with community standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government laid the Bill on the table some time ago for people to be able to respond to it. There have been several alterations in the new legislation compared to the old, and this is one of them. The old Bill said that programs must be in accordance with `prevailing community attitudes to matters of taste and decency'. But that has gone. Now it is `in accordance with community standards'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has said that the ABA may conduct surveys to establish these standards, but immediately pre-empts the ABA's decision in establishing community standards by saying that pay television may have R rated material only when it is accessed through the use of a pin number, smart card or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee of which I was Deputy Chairman and which looked into the standards of pay television has come down with certain recommendations. Of the three recommendations that are most important to this Bill, one is that it agrees with the Government that X rated material should not be considered suitable for pay television. When it came to R rated material, we said that we had such conflicting evidence in this regard that we believed that community attitudes to taste and decency should be established once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Senator Schacht has one view; he was entirely on his own in this area. The rest of the Committee believed that the community has never been allowed to express its views on community standards. The Film and Censorship Board, Senator Schacht assures us, has the complete support of the community. But when we asked its members how they came to this decision, they said that they talk to people&mdash;they travel on buses and talk to people in bus queues. I do not believe that is an appropriate way to establish community standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Committee has recommended that the ABA conduct extensive, Australia-wide qualitative and quantitative community research on community standards of taste and decency in relation to the classification of pay television, on what levels of violence and depictions of sex should be allowed and on what other matters should be included for viewing by adults and children in various classifications. I believe that that is a very important recommendation because, as I said earlier, it has never been done before and we have no idea what the community believes. As I go around my electorate, the majority of people say to me that the amount of violence on free to air television is too strong for their taste. The Governor-General made the same statement&mdash;that, as he goes around the countryside, he finds that people are concerned about the level of violence that there is on television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht said today that he took great note of the evidence of Professor Brent Waters. I could not agree with him more. When questioned about the use of Smartcard and PINs and whether that would save children seeing unwanted material, Professor Waters&mdash;who is a professor of child and adolescent psychiatry and lived in Canada for some time where pay television exists&mdash;said that he thought that parents often did not understand them and that this, coupled with a lack of supervision, told him that children were more at risk and created greater concerns. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While I believe that R rated material is probably harmful to some individuals and may have some harmful effect on the incidence of violent crime, the behavioural science studies have not been of sufficient quality to either affirm or discount this. My view would be that if Pay TV offers unrestricted access to children, harmful effects are more likely to occur.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, the intention of the Government is to have R-rated material available solely with the use of a PIN or Smartcard but, as Professor Waters said, this really is not secure enough to shield children. As I say, we had a tremendous amount of conflicting evidence. We had members of the National Women's Consultative Council say that they were particularly concerned. They believed that the pervasiveness of violent images was a contributing factor to the normalisation of a physical and sexually violent culture affecting the security and safety of women. Mr Lark, who always turns up at these things&mdash;he is one of the big lobbyists in Canberra&mdash;said, `No, anything goes. Put in X, put in R, put the lot in'. That was the evidence he gave. Because of this conflicting evidence, we made the recommendation and I believe that this is the way we should go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot rely on the industry making the decision. We cannot rely on the ABA being able to assess community standards any more than we can rely on the Film Censorship Board assessing community standards. The Film Censorship Board has never been able to establish that, and I believe that the reason we came up with this recommendation was most important. I would like to read&mdash;I hope the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), who is at the table, will listen to this&mdash;a judgment brought down not very long ago in a murder case. Part of the judgment says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At about 9.30 that morning the prisoner watched a video he had hired from a Wagga Wagga video shop. It was called "Nightmare at Shadow Woods". It was an unpleasant, violent film in which the major character was a psychopath who roamed the area with a large knife killing a number of people in extremely ghoulish circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having watched this film the prisoner took a knife, known as a butterfly knife, and walked across the paddocks to &mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the name of the victim's&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">home. He went to the front door and spoke to&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the victim&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">about some stray sheep which he said he had penned.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on, the judgment states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prisoner apparently left but did not return home. Instead he waited outside&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the victim's&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">home and about five minutes later removed the flyscreen from a bedroom window and climbed in. He encountered&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the victim&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in a hallway. She ran towards the kitchen in an unsuccessful attempt to reach the telephone. . . . She was clearly no match for the frenzied strength of the prisoner. He stabbed her again and again. Even when she was on the ground . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Further on, the judgment continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her two young children were sitting at the kitchen table watching it all and screaming. They were still sitting in the same place in the presence of their dead mother when&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>her husband&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">arrived home with the two older children about four hours later.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not have time to read a lot of the judgment, but two psychiatrists gave evidence in the case. Both of them said that they believed the violent video triggered the patient's violent outburst. The psychiatrists, one who was acting for the defence and one who was acting for the Crown, both agreed that the video had emotionally aroused the prisoner and had triggered the action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision was that the prisoner was quite able to distinguish right from wrong. He was a very disturbed young man but was not psychiatrically certifiable in any way. The judge said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not so easy to absolve a system which allows for such a violent and unmeritorious film as "Nightmare at Shadow Woods" to be viewed indiscriminately by members of the community regardless of their underlying problems or susceptibilities. It was a film with no discernible artistic material at all. As far as I could see it was nothing more than a vehicle for depicting gratuitous, mindless and ghoulish violence.</PARA>
<PARA>The judge went on to explain that both doctors thought that the film had acted as a trigger and that it was a disturbing agent in the prisoner's already disturbed brain. The judge said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I cannot help wondering what benefits society can derive from having such a mindlessly violent film as this generally available to be viewed by anyone, no matter how disturbed he or she may be. The potentially devastating effects can be seen in the events of 27 February.</PARA>
<PARA>I read that judgment because I asked the Chief Censor of the Film Censorship Board, Mr Dickie, whether he had read the judgment and reviewed the film. He said that he had been aware of both the judgment and the film but still believed that that film should be available under the M category. Unless we do something about the violence that we are presently seeing both in the videos that are available and on television, I believe we are leaving our community open for similar situations to arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that very behaviourally disturbed children attend our schools. They are not certifiable, but they have behavioural problems of violence. In allowing children growing up to view such films, I believe we are running a tremendous risk. It is because of my great concern in this area that I was so pleased to see the majority report of this Committee come down so strongly in the way it did in making sure that we can assess the general view of the community before we make any decisions as to what should and should not be allowed on pay television. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;While I welcome the shadow Minister into the chamber, I note once again that he cannot trust, as is his want, his opposite number in the Senate to carry the Broadcasting Services Bill and the Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill through unassisted and appears once again in the adviser's box. I have to say that Kim Beazley, when he was the Minister for Transport and Communications, never did that to me in the two years I was taking his stuff through this place. I would like to welcome the honourable member to the Senate. It is very pleasing to see one of these rare birds from the House of Representatives gracing us with his presence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the general support that has been provided by all speakers in this debate for the legislation. There is widespread support for this legislation. Everyone who has come through my door in recent weeks has supported the thrust of the reforms, and the previous Ministers for Transport and Communications found the same level of support, as was alluded to in a debate earlier today. This Bill goes back a very long way. This Bill has been years in the making. Given the amount of consultation that has taken place on this legislation, it is not surprising that this level of support has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill is significantly different from the exposure draft&mdash;it is different and it is better. It has been changed by the Government in response to views put forward by community groups and the radio and television industry. The Government was not prepared to accept every criticism levelled at the Bill. But I firmly believe that we have struck the right balance. What made the job a lot easier was the widespread belief that reform of the Broadcasting Act 1942 was long overdue. I thank all people who were involved in that exhaustive consultation process for their ideas and their cooperation. The Government will be moving a number of amendments today in response to further consultation and to tidy up certain drafting problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would quickly like to go through as many of the substantive issues as I can that have been raised in debate. I must address immediately the question of the exclusivity provisions that have been so strangely criticised by the Opposition. I say `strangely' because, as Senator Powell pointed out, the Opposition's current proposal is ludicrous. The Opposition has vacillated wildly on a range of options that are supposed to protect the viability of the first pay television licence that will buy a four-transponder satellite service. I was therefore totally amazed to sit in this chamber this morning and hear the Opposition put forward a truly bizarre proposal that demonstrates a clear misunderstanding of what pay TV is all about. I cannot honestly believe that the shadow Minister is in favour of this; I am sure that he must have been rolled in his party room on this one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, as I have said, Senator Powell drew our attention to this pig in a poke bundling&mdash;which I think was the expression used by Senator Alston&mdash;of individually sold single transponders for pay TV. The Opposition appears to have missed completely the point about what pay TV is about. Experience internationally has demonstrated this, if it has demonstrated nothing else: to be commercially successful, pay TV is about a multi-channel choice, letting viewers watch what they want to, when they want to and on a number of channels. That is how it works in the rest of the world. This proposal is world unique and that is why everybody certainly wants four transponders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry might have views on exclusivity. It also has views about wanting to access immediately 94 per cent of the Australian population with the technology now available on more than one channel. That is why everybody wants at least multiple transponders. Everybody also wants some market protection. I might say that that has also varied wildly and widely in the representations that I have had. Not surprisingly, the people who want to get this exclusivity want a lot of it. I have had serious representations made to me for 15 years of protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning I asked Senator Alston, by way of interjection, how his bundling proposal would work. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will demonstrate that he was very specific in his response. He said, `We will not allow alliances between the single transponder users'. The proposition which the Opposition has put up is not only unworkable but also it is quite bizarre. Senator Alston was very specific&mdash;and Senator Powell also commented on it afterwards&mdash;that there will be no alliances allowed between the individual operators who might get all of these single channels. So, until digital compression is available, any of these people who are expected to try to establish a market, to try to invest this amount of capital, to try to get market penetration, to try to drive what the technology is going to be, will be able to broadcast on only one channel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston said that the Opposition will not allow any alliances between them. Senator Alston said&mdash;and this is a scorched earth approach&mdash;that there has to be absolute maximum choice. It is a bizarre proposal which is entirely unworkable. I must say that I just do not understand what is driving it. How could a single channel service possibly be marketed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are wildly varying views&mdash;and views have been put to me&mdash;about digital compression. People say that if we want to pay for it, `it might be available in two years'. But there is wide consensus in the industry that in terms of affordable digital compression&mdash;that is, a technology which provides quality which people will actually be able to pay for&mdash;is somewhere between four and six years away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth pointing out that all of the proponents in 1982&mdash;I remember them very well&mdash;said that optic fibre was just around the corner in every home in Australia. I have files full of assertions that were made in regard to that. But 10 years later there is now a widespread industry view that that technology will never ever arrive in that sense. Experience around the world&mdash;and Senator Alston knows this&mdash;is that it is the hybrid systems which have proved to be the most achievable. I am talking here about optic fibre to a distribution point and normal cheap coaxial cable from that point on. So I would treat these statements with some degree of suspicion and doubt. Assuming that digital compression is four to six years off, the fundamental proposition on which the whole pay TV service advanced by the Opposition is based is not only unworkable but is bizarre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the free transponder for the ABC is concerned, let me say at the outset that the Government has demonstrated its support in a very substantial way for ABC involvement in pay TV. The difference between us and the Opposition is that we want the ABC to do it on sensible commercial grounds. Anyone who knows anything about pay TV and understands where the ABC is coming from on this&mdash;and the ABC has a very detailed proposal&mdash;knows that the Opposition's proposal is ludicrous. We have to make sure that this new service requirement is provided to the ABC with a sensible business plan, with access to the necessary equity capital and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill that is before the Senate paves the way for the ABC to play a part in pay TV. We have also made available $12.5m to enable the ABC to get started. Under Fightback, the Opposition will axe the ABC by $50m a year recurrent. But, more importantly, the Government will accept no risk exposure from this commercial operation, nor will it allow the ABC's charter activities to be compromised. I cannot have been stronger in my public views on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Personally, I have no doubt that what is driving the Opposition in terms of its determination to have the ABC in pay TV is its desire to see the ABC become more and more commercial so that it will have an excess for axing the ABC's budget. There is no question in my mind about that. People keep talking about quality programming. If we really want to see quality programs, why, under the Opposition's proposals, are we going to force SBS to wait until digital compression is available? As I have said, the consensus view is that commercially this is four to six years away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does not the Opposition be up front and include SBS in this proposal as well as the ABC? As I have said before, the fundamental thing that is driving the Opposition in its desire to push the ABC into pay TV is the opportunity to further cut the ABC's budget. There is no question about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that we have concerns about the hasty drafting&mdash;and I will allude to that in a minute&mdash;which is in the same schedule of amendments that contain the ABC amendments. We are not in a position simply to agree after being given five minutes notice. We have a little bit more concern about this matter. We do support the involvement of the ABC in pay TV in the way in which we have already outlined. We have some real budget commitment for the ABC to do it properly. But we cannot at this time support the amendments that are currently proposed by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the report of the Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Telecommunications Technologies&mdash;the 0055 committee report&mdash;I am not going to get bogged down once again in discussing a subject which has been canvassed to such an extent in this House. But the Government does endorse the Reynolds committee recommendations on X-rated material. Under this Bill, X-rated material is banned on all commercial and subscription television broadcasting services in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also agree that the ABA should conduct Australia-wide qualitative and quantitative research on community attitudes in relation to classifications for pay TV. However, the Committee recommends as an interim measure the use of current free to air television standards for pay TV. Banning R-rated material would reduce, without any question, the attractiveness of pay TV and deny viewers access to mainstream blockbuster movies such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Godfather</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taxi Driver</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Apocalypse Now</EMPHASIS> and even Australia's own <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Don's Party</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I absolutely agree with Senator Walters that there is a lot of rubbish in the R-rated category&mdash;there is no question about that&mdash;but there are some absolutely spectacularly good movies for adults that not only should adults have the right to watch but some of which they should watch. I am sure that Senator Walters would agree with me&mdash;or maybe she would not&mdash;about one R-rated movie we saw on the committee dealing with X-rated videos. It dealt with the horrendous problems of rape for women and was so thought provoking that not only should people have the right to watch such movies, but, in my view, it would be advisable for them to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is at the bottom of our proposals on R-rated movies is quite simple. We can have this debate about whether we should have R-rated movies, but why should anybody argue about pay TV, which is a discretionary service that is basically moving the video shop on the corner to a black decoder on the top of the television set? People should at least have the same access to the programming that is available straight off the shelf&mdash;tons of it&mdash;from the local video store. It makes no sense otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There needs to be a device which enables absolute security in terms of the choices that the adults in a house make about what they will watch. Senator Walters is shaking her head, and I know why. I am not going to get bogged down in this, but I refer to an interjection that Senator Harradine pounced upon in his contribution earlier when I said, `The parents are responsible. Why are you putting all the onus on the TV?'. Senator Harradine talked at length about the dreadful problem with children in Australia watching so much television and having access to this material. The problem is this: in the real world&mdash;the world I live in&mdash;yes, Australian children do watch much more TV than they should do. Who is responsible for that? Their parents are. Australian children watch far too much R-rated and M-rated material that they should not watch. Who is responsible for that? Their parents are responsible. That is who is responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell honourable senators what happens in the real world&mdash;and I am not condemning these people; this is just what happens. An adult goes to the video shop, walks out with an armload of $7-worth of M-rated and R-rated videos for seven days and leaves them lying all over the house. Kids have greater access to R-rated material in the real world now, courtesy of their parents, than they could possibly have under this system, which can only be accessed with a Smartcard or some enabling device which is as secure as a Bankcard&mdash;and kids only get that when their parents want them to, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make this point for the last time in this debate: ultimately, it is not a question for this Parliament to start denying TV. Senator Panizza spoke about waiting until more technology is developed. If we took this attitude, we would still be locked up with our crystal sets where we all started from 40 years ago. That is an extraordinarily stupid position to take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have views on R-rated material, particularly in terms of violence. Senator Harradine knows them, as does Senator Walters. That is the crud that I am referring to in blockbuster TV movies. It does not stop them being box office hits, but you would be a fool to equate box office success with quality. It is the violence in those movies that I object to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pay TV is a separate issue. Pay TV, at least sensibly, should have as much access to that material as the local video store down on the corner does. Otherwise, people will still do what they do now and just get the R-rated material, leave it all over the house, as they do now, and the kids will watch it. That is the parents' fault; it is not the fault of the television channel that provides material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats proposed that the 10 per cent Australian drama requirement be introduced on all subscription services from day one. That is not a workable proposition. We learned from the VAEIS system and the Canadian experience that, if we over-regulate at the outset, we may drive services out of business. NBS and cable technologies will be extremely limited in the early years of their audience work&mdash;and they will. Some services will also be limited by the fact that they will only want to pursue niche markets, particularly ethnic services where such imposts would only exacerbate their marginality. Some that I know will be totally at odds with what they are trying to provide for their markets anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the Government has taken the far more sensible approach of legislating for a review in 1997 of the appropriateness of the current regime. At that time, we will be better placed to assess on the basis of experience the extent to which the fledgling industry can bear such costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the suggestion that we should define `new', I would have thought that this word was well understood by the regulator and the courts. Of course, the Government will be expecting new produced-for-pay-TV drama to emerge. In fact, most of the serious operators say that the only way they will succeed is if they do that. No doubt the ABA will be issuing guidelines for licensees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate here, as I did in the second reading speech, that the Government has made it fundamentally clear that, as far as the four-transponder service is concerned, the Government will be providing guidelines which will result in Australian industry having a substantial involvement in this process. I am told&mdash;and I think it is probably right&mdash;that up to 4,000 jobs can reasonably be expected to be created. My own view, for what it is worth, is that pay TV will take off in this country; everything else similar to it has. I think that 4,000 jobs will be created as a result of this industry. This Government is absolutely determined to ensure that they are Australian jobs and that we will provide those standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the ABA's powers to investigate the content of programs is concerned&mdash;and this is our concern about the much argued journalists' privileges&mdash;the concern we have about the Democrats' amendment, and I hope on reflection they agree with this, is that it goes well beyond the protection of journalists' notebooks. That is the problem with it. The main concern is that it would effectively neutralise the ABA's powers in relation to program standards and complaints. For example, the ABA could not use its powers under clauses 171, 175 or 193 to effectively police standards, particularly Australian content and children's programming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Broadcasters could refuse to produce documents such as scripts and videotapes under this amendment, which would be vital for any such investigation, making it impossible for the ABA to enforce standards. Therefore, for that reason, and only that reason, the Government feels that we cannot accept the Democrats' solution to this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am on the public record&mdash;and I assert it again&mdash;as having a view about journalistic privilege. It is something we need to have a look at. In my view, the experience over the years has been that, in genuine cases of investigative journalism, when journalists have run foul of the courts, the law has ended up on every occasion looking like an ass and the journalists like heroes. But it is not as simple providing for that protection as people think it is. A classic example of how to stuff it up has been provided by the Opposition in the debate here today. We cannot accept&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As drafted, the amendment that was going to fix this exempted a journalist from any requirement to answer a question or produce a document where the answer to the question or the production of the document would disclose the identity of a confidential source of information. That amendment was to be made to clause 200 of the Bill. As the heading makes absolutely clear, the entire section is dealing with providing protection for the members of the panel, not witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was pointed out to me by legal counsel, the effect of that amendment would, arguably, have been to have provided a penalty of a year in gaol for any person asking a journalist to produce information that might disclose a source. For example, a journalist in the dock before a judge in Perth, who is charged with an offence under the relevant Act on insider trading, could have demanded and got an exemption from providing that information under this provision. The amendment does not restrict this exemption of journalists to their journalistic activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a wide-ranging amendment that exempts journalists from having to answer a question about confidential sources even if it has nothing to do with their work. It is a piece of nonsense. Not only would it exempt the journalist from providing that information in a court, but it could conceivably sentence the judge to a year in gaol under this amendment for even asking for the information. It is a piece of nonsense. I am glad the Opposition is withdrawing it. </PARA>

So much has been said about this in the past week that it is worth saying that, in order to provide the necessary protection of journalists&mdash;which I have consistently publicly asserted should be provided&mdash;it is not as simple a solution as the Opposition might have us believe. That is why Opposition members have made such a comprehensive mess of it in trying to introduce it into this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend to the Senate the Government's suggestion, which is a far cleaner solution. I invite the Opposition to withdraw its second amendment in the light of this proposal, and I ask the Democrats for their support to delete the entire clause from the Broadcasting Services Bill. That is precisely what the Government is proposing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as advertising is concerned, the question is whether we have to go back to a mandated advertising time. I have made the Government's position clear. We would prefer to allow the industry to develop a code of conduct, but&mdash;consistent with the fact that the industry did not stick to its own arrangements previously and the tribunal had to reimpose a mandated code&mdash;we have put the industry on notice. I have personally said to representatives of the networks, and they accept it, that if they provide a code, which obviously would have to be largely consistent with the current standards, and they transgress it, we would expect the ABA immediately to pull them to heel on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think clause 181 is the relevant clause as it allows the Minister to have an inquiry into a matter if he wants to. I do not mind advising the Senate that the Government would not hesitate to provide for this inquiry if the ABA did not move. Personally, I am confident that that would be totally unnecessary. I have no doubt that the ABA would move if the code of practice proved not to be complied with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the question of complaints about the ABC and SBS, the complaints provisions in this Bill are sensibly balanced between providing an independent adjudicator of complaints about the ABC or SBS and the need to preserve the editorial independence of those organisations. The balance is achieved by giving the ABC and SBS autonomy over development of their own codes of practice. The ABC and SBS are required to notify codes which the ABA will use as a benchmark. If a complaint is proven, the ABA can ask the national broadcasters to take corrective action. If they do not, the ABA will report to the Minister who must table that report in the Parliament. The threat of public exposure should encourage the national broadcasters to abide by their codes, and I think it will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Democrats' amendment to remove this court of last resort were adopted, it would still not solve the problem of handling complaints. It is, however, very likely that a far more costly mechanism would be needed elsewhere. If the Opposition amendment of parliamentary disallowance of ABC and SBS codes were accepted, this may be an unwarranted intrusion&mdash;and in my view would be an unwarranted intrusion&mdash;into the editorial independence of those organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliament approves the charters and enabling legislation of these bodies. To go further could lead to political interference in the day-to-day services of the ABC and SBS, and it should be rejected by this Parliament. The wording currently proposed in the Bill at clauses 148 to 151 is a balanced approach between these two extremes. I commend it to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the enforcement provisions are concerned, people have approached me suggesting that the penalties, which can be as high as $2m a day, are too severe. The Government believes that breaches of key provisions of the Bill, given the influence of broadcasting services, and television in particular, should be the subject of significant penalties as a disincentive. I stress that the penalties of the Bill are the maximum that can be imposed. Also, they would not be imposed by the regulator but by a court which would take into account the severity and importance of the breach. The degree of regulatory intervention and associated penalties reflect the power of the service to influence. There is a sliding scale of penalties consistent with this principle and similar penalties are included in the Telecommunications Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Government is moving an amendment to reduce the daily penalties, while retaining the maximum penalty. I believe this is an effective and reasonable compromise. To do this would reduce the daily penalty for ongoing offences to one-tenth of the penalty for the principal offence, but leave the maximum penalty in place for the initial breach. It reduces the maximum daily penalty from a potential $2m to $200,000, still providing the incentive to rectify breaches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say, with respect to the Opposition and giving them the benefit of the doubt, that this is possibly another Opposition stuff-up, but the Government cannot support the Opposition's proposal to allow the banning of advertising for a limited period. The difficulty with that is that when there is an effective monetary penalty, why should people who want to advertise their products be disadvantaged? It may well be that it is the only channel in town that can do it for them, and they want to advertise and promote their products. Why should the innocent bystanders be made the victims by not allowing their products to be advertised because the TV channel is being punished? It makes no sense. I ask for that not to be supported, because we have adequate financial penalties to impose on the TV channel without punishing the advertisers themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is still proceeding with its amendment to put a cap on the maximum. That is crazy. To suggest that the maximum that can be charged on a daily penalty should be capped will mean that the daily penalty will run out after two days. Again, giving the Opposition the benefit of the doubt, I regard this as a mistake. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have 11 amendments to move to the legislation and the Minister, in his reply, has not addressed any of them. I have sent to him a brief explanatory note in respect of these and I will just go very briefly through that. The first amendment adds the words `prevailing community attitudes to matters of taste and decency'. These words were contained in the exposure draft. The insertion of these words in the objects clause would reinforce the duties of both broadcasters and the ABA to be aware of community standards. The word `respect' has been replaced with the word `reflect' which was the word used by the House of Representatives Standing Committee. The word `any' has been included before the word `program' so as to restore the need for programs to meet program standards both in part and in whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment simply reflects my desire to reinforce the power of the ABA. It proposes to amend the objects clause, clause 3, by substituting `encourage and ensure' for `encourage'. The third amendment adds the following paragraph to the objects of the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to ensure that providers of broadcasting services place a high priority on the protection of children from exposure to program material which may be harmful to them.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth amendment reintroduces the relevant portions of section 118 of the current Act but does so in a manner which will enable the ABA and others with locus standi to take appropriate action. Under section 118 of the current Act, it is an offence for any person to have broadcast over radio or television any matter which is blasphemous, indecent or obscene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sixth amendment simply enables the ABA to deal with codes of practice as well as standards. This amendment simply deletes the word `convincing' which is currently in the Bill before the word `evidence'. I believe that deleting the word `convincing' will limit unnecessary litigation being taken by the industry against ABA decisions. Again, amendments 7 and 8 simply add the words `codes of practice' to the provision. Amendment 9 also adds the words `codes of practice', and it adds section 120 codes of practice to those measures which are disallowable instruments, thus providing the Parliament with an ongoing overview. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment 10 enables the ABA to require prior approval of programs if necessary, as in fact the ABT at the present moment is empowered to do. The eleventh amendment reflects the view of the House of Representatives Standing Committee inquiry and other inquiries about the need for wide consultation so that members of the Authority can reflect community standards. I understand that the Opposition is moving a further amendment relating to transmission of R-rated material over subscription services and I will be supporting that. </PARA>

If Senator Powell still has a problem with the wording of the amendment after Senator Harradine has explained that the enabling device is in the schedule, then I would seek extra time. This is not the way to go about legislation when two of the parties want an amendment and, because of the guillotine, are unable to have their wishes put into legislation. If we could have time to word the amendment so that the Democrats agree to it, then the legislation would go through in a proper fashion. I ask for just a few minutes so that we can seek the cooperation of the Democrats in rewording the amendment, because I know they are of the opinion that the amendment should go through.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Bill is to remedy a problem created with respect to the definition of "carrier" appearing in the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. The current definition of "carrier", which was inserted in the Interception Act by the Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1991 ("the Transitional Act"), refers to carriers licensed under the Telecommunications Act 1991. From the commencement of that definition in the Interception Act on 1 July 1991 until the coming into force of licences issued to carriers by the Minister for Transport and Communications under section 57 of the Telecommunications Act, the corporations which became subject to those licences (which, at the time, were Telecom, OTC and AUSSAT) did not fall within the Interception Act's definition of "carrier".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, there is some doubt about the authority conferred by warrants under the Interception Act to intercept communications during that period. There were in fact a number of warrants issued and executed during that period, and information intercepted under those warrants would, in due course, be relied on in prosecutions for serious offences. Since the Government is concerned at the possibility that any such prosecutions might fail simply because of a technical defect with the operation of the provisions in the Transitional Act, it has acted, with the understanding of the Opposition and the Democrats, to ensure that there is legislation in place to remedy the problems before the prosecutions commence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the Bill seeks to do two things. First, it continues in operation during the relevant period the Interception Act's definitions of "carrier" and "Corporation" (meaning Telecom) that were in force immediately prior to the relevant period. Secondly, it applies the new definition of "carrier" provided for by the Transitional Act immediately after the relevant period. The Bill does these things in a way which will ensure that the operation of the Interception Act's substantive provisions relating to the issue and execution of warrants may be taken to have continued in a seamless way throughout the period between 1 July 1991 until the coming into force of the carrier licences granted by my colleague the Minister for Transport and Communications on 22 November 1991.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition will not be opposing this Bill, which the Government is introducing in an effort to head off a potential problem arising from the definition of `carrier' inserted last year in the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. In that Act, the definition refers to carriers licensed under the Telecommunications Act 1991. The definition was inserted by the Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1991 that came into force on 1 July 1991. Unfortunately, the licences issued by the Minister for Transport and Communications did not actually come into force until nearly five months later, on 22 November 1991. I understand that technically, therefore, Telecom, OTC and Aussat were, arguably at least, not carriers for the purposes of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act during that time and that warrants issued during those five months for interceptions may have been invalid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Act corrects that defect by making clear that, notwithstanding the provisions of the transitional Act, the old definition of `carrier' continued until the licensing time on 22 November, when the new definition commenced. All agencies, therefore, will effectively have been carriers for the purposes of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act and none of the warrants issued will be technically invalid on this ground. From the Minister's second reading speech, we understand that the Government is concerned to prevent the possible failure of any prosecutions relying on evidence gathered from telephone interceptions undertaken on what might prove to be technically defective warrants. Therefore, we support the Government in its move to correct the defect through the passage of this Bill before the commencement of any such prosecutions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight because I had a phone call after lunch today from one of the senior management members of the Civil Aviation Authority. He wanted to see me and bring a team along to explain the CAA's position in relation to the TAAATS contract. It is really a bit late when we are 18 months into a contract for that approach to be made. The other side to it is that the Civil Aviation Authority was on numerous occasions afforded the opportunity by this Parliament to put its case&mdash;to the Public Works Committee, to the Senate Estimates Committee and during the committee stage of the Appropriation Bill. Not only did it have the opportunity, but also it was requested to do so, and it failed to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of what was a long conversation, it became quite apparent to me that there is an inadequate comprehension by the people concerned as to how public affairs are conducted in this country. It may be that, because they come from another country and are not long term career public servants, they do not understand the system here. Maybe that is one of the reasons for the mess we are in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the matters that were raised with me clearly need to be addressed in public. But first I would like to refer to Senator Cook's press conference today at the Press Club. I did not hear all of it because I was engaged in a conversation with one of the senior managers of the CAA, but I did understand Senator Cook, in response to a question as to whether he would freeze the negotiations between the Civil Aviation Authority and Thomson Radar while the inquiry was held into the selection process, to say that, while he initially thought such a freeze would be a good move, he is now convinced that that is not the correct option because it will involve the country in very high cost penalties. By implication, I draw from that that there will be political penalties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite alarmed at that interpretation of events. Any sense of propriety demands that those negotiations be put on hold until the inquiry is held. Senator Cook's statement today, as I understand it, says very clearly that Thomson is driving the whole program. It is driving the CAA management, which in turn is driving the Minister. That is a deplorable state of affairs. There is no argument at all for the negotiations to be carried on at the present time. There is no increased cost and, if Thomson is going to blackmail the Government with an increased cost, let us drop it here and now. Let us go to Hughes, Siemens, IBM, Raytheon or any other company where we will not only get a lower bid but also get the work completed much quicker and to a higher technical standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is intolerable that we should be blackmailed by a company on that line. There is no technical reason why speed is of the essence; why speed has to be pursued in this way at this time. The facilities in Brisbane and Sydney are old and run down, but emergency systems can be moved in to cope with that in the short term. Indeed, some of the tenderers did offer to do that. It is just part of a general blackmail move. I deplore those sorts of actions by a tenderer, which should not be in the position where it can exercise so much power, or really any power at all, over the client. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no intention tonight of recapitulating the history of these long, extensive and involved tender negotiations but, as I said when I first expressed an interest in this, my initial concern was the announcement that there would be no Australian prime contractors in it. In March 1992, when it was announced that the preferred tenderer would have the lowest Australian content, I was again concerned. There has been a lot of nonsense talk by the management of the CAA about how they are not wasting money. They make the point that the taxpayer no longer funds aviation; that the aviation industry does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point to be made is that there is a great deal of waste coming from the mismanagement of the CAA. The difficulty&mdash;or the impossibility&mdash;for the Parliament is to measure how extensive that waste is. We are not presented with a balance sheet in any meaningful form that we can take before an Estimates committee. We have no Estimates coming before the Parliament so we cannot see what budgeting system exists, how much money these people are wasting. We can only get a glimpse of it here and there, and we can only assume from the small glimpses we have that it is considerably larger. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The board of the Civil Aviation Authority agreed to buy the controversial new $300-$400 million two-centre air traffic control system without a full cost-benefit analysis, according to confidential documents obtained by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The board also agreed to write off up to $48 million by cancelling more than $200 million worth of contracts intended to upgrade the current system, the papers show.</PARA>
<PARA>That was $48m written off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the CAA disputes that figure and says that it is about $25m or $28m. The point is that that is money wasted. The CAA delightfully referred to it as sunk costs, but it is my money and it is your money that has gone down the tube for no benefit at all. The CAA counters that argument by saying, `Well, by throwing out the system that we were going to spend that money on, we have saved $100m'. But that is a hypothetical argument and really has no substance. We have lost that money, and we have lost it through mismanagement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the evidence about waste is indirect. Evidence given at the hearing of the Joint Committee on Public Works in Brisbane on 8 April was that the CAA lost $13.9m on a building contract. It is also interesting to note the CAA's view that it is not taxpayers' money but that of the aviation industry. On page 103 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, the witness Mr Brown, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a freehold building on freehold land, owned by the Civil Aviation Authority. It was not paid for by the taxpayer; it was paid from charges to the aviation industry and, as I said, it met commercial justification. The plans were to accommodate some 200-odd people, including warehouse. The warehouse site was sold recently for in the order of $1.3m, and the purchase of the land was $0.5m. The building costs were in the order of $8m and then there was fit out. I cannot give you the exact figure, but I do not believe it was $13.9m. It was significantly less than that.</PARA>
<PARA>We cannot as a parliament get a handle on this waste, but it is quite clear that there is mismanagement leading to waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relevance of what I am saying tonight about this waste is that one of the reasons why Australian primes were not included, and why the CAA selected a tenderer with a minimal Australian subcontracting content, was that it said it did not waste money. Yet here it is wasting tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars through its management program, and it is not prepared to give Australian industry a chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a very strong defender of Australian industry. Unlike the principals of the CAA, I happen to live in this country and I intend to go on living in this country; I do not have a contract which will expire in a year or two. I am interested in seeing Australian industry developed. I am prepared to pay a reasonable premium to ensure that Australian industry has the opportunity to develop. If the country of origin of air traffic control systems does not buy those systems, particularly in the electronics field, that equipment cannot be sold abroad. This is the dreadful situation that companies like AWA face at present. They are rejected in their own country and their overseas prospects are thereby significantly circumscribed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I can work it out, there is no premium in having a high Australian content in this TAAATS contract. I have talked to most of the principal tenderers, apart from Thomson, and they all tell me that the Australian companies were screwed down to the barest minimum figure. They were competitive with overseas contractors in every sense, particularly in a price sense. So it seems quite reasonable to assume that there was no premium to be paid for Australian content. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central point of this whole dispute that has been dragging on for such a while before the Parliament is the accountability of the Civil Aviation Authority. That would never have arisen if there had been more intelligent management. I do not find it strange that there is a major inquiry currently in the New Zealand Parliament into the administrative practices of Messrs Baldwin and Edwards while they were running the New Zealand Aircraft Corporation. I am not saying that there was anything dishonest in what they did, but that probably, on the evidence we have seen in Australia, it was very badly organised. If it was organised to such a degree that there had to be a parliamentary inquiry, which is running currently, it must have been a pretty formidable exercise in mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument of the management of the CAA at present is that it is a government business enterprise. Somehow there is an aura of untouchability about being a GBE. It is not accountable to anyone but its shareholder, which is the Commonwealth of Australia. That is the end of the story.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Well, it is not the end of the story, because the Parliament represents the Commonwealth of Australia and the people of Australia. The attitude that is held by management&mdash;that as a GBE it is accountable to no-one&mdash;is carried on down the line and instilled by management. My earlier quotation from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Public Works Committee hearing reflects the point of view that the CAA is not really accountable to anyone; that it is not spending the money of the taxpayer but of the aviation industry. That notion seems to flow through the Department at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard of numerous speeches that the Chief Executive Officer, Mr Baldwin, has made where he has defended his GBE concept and the lack of any need to answer. In fact, on the second page of a speech made to the Australian Aviation Club in Canberra on 28 May 1992, a copy of which I have here, Mr Baldwin, when talking about the CAA, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal purpose was to take it out of being managed and operated as a bureaucratic government department and convert it into what the name suggests&mdash;a business enterprise&mdash;along the lines of the private sector, and accountable through the board of directors to its shareholder&mdash;not through parliamentary committees of inquiries.</PARA>
<PARA>The legal point is that GBEs are not excluded from accountability to the Parliament. Government business enterprises are statutory authorities. A statutory authority is a body set up under statute. In lay terminology, that is a body set up by an Act of the parliament&mdash;in this case, an Act of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing in the Civil Aviation Act 1988, which is the Act that sets up the Civil Aviation Authority, that excludes the Civil Aviation Authority from accounting to the Parliament for its actions. It does not prescribe any special cases where it shall not be accountable. Therefore, it follows that it must account to the Parliament when it is called to account. It was called to account on a number of occasions by the Public Works Committee this year, and it refused to comply with those requests. It refused to supply the information requested at the Estimates hearing of this Senate earlier this year. It refused to supply information in the committee stage of the Appropriation Bill in this chamber a few weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the information of the senior management of the CAA, who seem to be totally incapable of understanding this point, I want to put this in its historical perspective. In 1971, the Senate resolved that there is no area of expenditure of public funds by statutory authorities which cannot be examined by Parliament or its committees. This declaration was reaffirmed on a number of occasions&mdash;in 1974, in 1980 and in 1984. In the 1980 resolution, the Senate declared that there are no areas of expenditure of public funds where statutory bodies have a discretion to withhold details or explanations from Parliament or its committees, and that this principle supervened any right of privacy. A similar resolution concerning the duty of statutory authorities to cooperate with parliamentary inquiries was passed in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those resolutions of the Senate mean what they say. They have the force of law and any person who breaches them is put at risk of a charge of contempt of the Senate. As a consequence of that such a person can be brought before the Senate and fined. He or she can be put in gaol if the Senate so chooses, because refusal to cooperate is a rejection of the power of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arguments that the CAA has advanced against this are a litany of the old singsong of commercial-in-confidence, contractual obligations, the cost to Australia and all the other dissembling cliches that can be trotted out in such a situation to try to evade its responsibility. The point is that none of that will wash. It has a responsibility to be accountable to the Parliament. I cannot understand why, having been made aware of this on a number of occasions, it still persists with it. The arguments that the CAA uses of commercial in confidence or contractual obligations simply will not stand up to any sort of analysis at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Parliament has been in business since federation in 1901. We have dealt with thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of contracts with the Commonwealth Government in that time and no authority has ever tried this dissembling action on the Parliament. No authority is ever going to try it on and get away with it, because the importance is that, if the Parliament loses its responsibility to account for the expenditure of public funds, then the Parliament loses any authority it has in the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rule of law in this country is supported by a voluntary act of the citizens and for the Government to enforce the rule of law, its authority and its probity has to be beyond dispute. We cannot afford this Parliament being seen to allow the upsetting of tendering procedures and procedures in relation to the assessment of tenders. These procedures have been worked out over 30 years and provide accountability for the expenditure of public funds by ensuring that an honest and correct evaluation has been made of those tender proposals. We cannot allow them to be set aside because in this case an authority pleaded that it had a special case and could not conform to the tendering procedures laid down by the Department of Administrative Services, and then refused to explain in detail, step by step, how it came to its decision. That is what the CAA is doing at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot allow that pattern of contract assessment to become the norm for Australian tender evaluation. To do so would be to cede all the accountability the Parliament has for the expenditure of funds. This is a most fundamental issue and that is why the move taken by the CAA at the present time must be subjected to an independent evaluation along the lines proposed somewhat tentatively by Senator Cook and the Parliament must satisfy itself on this occasion that the integrity of the assessment process has been beyond dispute.</PARA>

<PARA>to which Gutherie replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, I think there is something in that John because he hasn't proved any inaccuracies here, it's just a disagreement with the tone of the piece and I think you can't have Prime Ministers going around selecting what newspapers, indeed any media, are going to cover.</PARA>
<PARA>The journalist ended up by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . what a petty and petulant thing for Keating to do, hard to believe that the man is the Prime Minister when he carries out acts like that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning there was an interview between Mr Steve Liebmann and Mr Harris, the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS> on this matter in which Mr Harris said that clearly Mr Keating believed it was an invasion of his privacy. Mr Harris then said that Mr Keating said in the conversation with him that:</PARA>

<PARA>Mr Harris said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, I mean basically what he was saying was that we'd get no cooperation from either his office or the Treasurer's office, which would have made it very difficult obviously for our Canberra Correspondent, Mike Gordon, and other reporters based in Melbourne to operate effectively. We could have lived with that, it wouldn't have stopped the paper coming out and we certainly would have maintained our normal political coverage but it wouldn't have been made any easier.

<PARA>Mr Harris went on to defend the printing of the article that offended Mr Keating by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think the reason why this sort of material should be in the public domain is that I think the public is entitled to make its own view as to sort of, what is the difference between the presented imagery, well polished imagery of our political leaders and what is the reality.</PARA>
<PARA>When he was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In spite of the tongue lashing and the threats of bans which either were there but have now been lifted, you don't regret doing what the paper did last Sunday?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Harris replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, not at all and under similar circumstances we'll do it again.</PARA>
<PARA>Could I say how much I commend the journalists involved, particularly the editor, for standing up to this kind of heavying by Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not an isolated example. Mr Keating had been, in fact, notorious for expressing in vigorous terms his displeasure with newspaper articles and for, to use a popular expression, standing over journalists who chose to write articles which were not useful in Mr Keating's view, particularly in terms of invasions of his privacy. Obviously, there are some instances where, without doubt, there is an invasion of privacy which I think all politicians would regret. There is a widespread acceptance that politicians' privacy can be invaded and so, to an extent, one can sympathise with some elements of Mr Keating's concerns. One cannot, however, sympathise with the manner in which he responds to them. This was evident in recent times&mdash;for example, in his response to Mr Bruce Jones only last September when Mr Jones reported some facts about the use of a car. I quote from a newspaper report at the time which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The former Treasurer, Mr Keating, has issued a veiled threat to have the Tax Office audit journalists who wrote stories critical of him.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Keating raised the prospect of audits on the press to a journalist who had revealed details of his car expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On Sunday afternoon&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, in September&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Sun-Herald's political reporter, Bruce Jones, received a phone call from Mr Keating.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A story by Mr Jones published that morning said Mr Keating was still using the Commonwealth car service almost two months after stepping down as Treasurer, and he had clocked up a $4,000 bill in just one month.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Keating is believed to have said he was tired of journalists accusing people of rorting the system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He is understood to have said that it would be `interesting' if the Tax Office audited the journalists in the parliamentary press gallery and examined some of their `bodgie' deductions.</PARA>
<PARA>This sort of standover tactic is not really the sort of thing one would expect from a man who, at that stage, was not Prime Minister but who apparently appears to have an excessive sensitivity every Sunday. Sundays are obviously Mr Keating's bad days and I suggest to those in the Press Gallery that they should avoid writing any articles critical of Mr Keating on Sundays because they will get a spray. I quote from another article by Mr Fred Brenchley which was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. It reads:</PARA>

<PARA>I just mention that I did a quick survey of the press gallery to see whether this sort of standover tactic has been going on as it used to and as, certainly, it still was last Sunday and last September. I was told that, in fact, these last two instances are reversions to type and that this sort of thing had not happened on a large scale for quite some time.

But it does seem to me worth raising with the Senate the question of whether this sort of behaviour is appropriate. As I said, I do not intend to go down the track which would encourage any question of whether imputations are being put, but it seems Mr Keating is highly sensitive to criticism. It is for the public to determine whether this kind of response to such criticism is appropriate for a Prime Minister and whether it is reasonable for members of the media to be stood over in this way. </PARA>

Those opposite voted him into office not because of his public policy success&mdash;no-one could have voted in Mr Keating because he had a success in public policy; he was the guy who planned our recession&mdash;but because they thought, `Here is a guy who can really kick heads.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable Senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Australia is not providing funds in overseas aid commitments for ammunition clearance from the scene of World War II Pacific battle zones. The honourable Senator should address questions on such activities which may have been carried out under Australia's Defence Cooperation Program to the Minister for Defence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian conflict provides for mine clearance and training operations to be coordinated and supervised by trained personnel of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). Australia is not directly involved in any of UNTAC's mine clearance activities. We are, however, supporting the operation through our assessed contribution (1.51 per cent) to the UNTAC budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to this contribution to UNTAC, a total of $2.2 million has been provided to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for the repatriation of displaced Cambodians living in camps on the Thai border. Mine-clearance is a crucial concern for the UNHCR, since scarcity of mine-free land is one of the major constraints on the repatriation operation. UNHCR has conducted mine identification surveys in Cambodia and mine awareness training in the displaced persons camps on the Thai border. However, UNHCR is not playing a principal operational role in mine clearance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Parts of the mine clearance operation in Cambodia are the subject of UN tenders. It is open to any Australian company to tender for UN contracts, whether they be in the area of mine clearance or in more traditional development work. Information about procurement opportunities with the UN is systematically collected and disseminated by AUSTRADE. Companies interested in working with the UN should contract AUSTRADE for advice on how best to proceed. I am not in a position to say whether Australian firms have the necessary expertise to effectively carry out mine clearance work in Cambodia or the Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Australian Government does not propose to specifically allocate funds from overseas aid commitments for the purposes of mine or live ammunition clearance from either Cambodia or the Pacific World War II battle zones.</PARA>
